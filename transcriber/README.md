# Transcriber

## How to use 
1. Put all of your audio clips in a directory.
2. Open the `transcribe.sh` file and change the input directory.
3. If you'd like to change the output directory, change that as well.
4. Change directory `cd ../` and run `source activate_venv.sh` if the environment is not active.
5. Go back to the same level directory as this `README.md` file - `cd -`
6. Run `bash setup.sh` to activate whisper in the virtual environment.
7. Run `bash transcribe.sh`. The program will audomatically transcribe every `.mp3` file in that directory as well as provide a progress bar.
