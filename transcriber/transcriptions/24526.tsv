0	14500	Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will take place tomorrow.
16320	25000	And our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county.
25000	38900	And I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is.
41880	50280	We translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all.
50280	66160	And we have that problem with the English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings.
67320	70600	And as a result, they become misinterpreted.
70600	76340	And that's why many of them we retain in the original form, such as Donna.
79260	81560	Donna is one of the paramitas.
82840	85280	There are six paramitas.
86680	89820	And these paramitas have been in existence a long time.
89920	93060	They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of.
93060	97780	And Donna is the first of those.
98240	104720	And each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you somehow miss what they're about.
104820	107900	For example, we translate Prajna paramita.
109060	113460	Paramita literally means other shore or to cross over.
113460	129680	And our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now.
132480	134440	Prajna, we translate as wisdom.
134440	140780	And wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about accumulating knowledge.
141660	143780	It's not what Prajna means.
144580	148460	It has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it have anything to do with knowing.
151820	155540	So that the calling it wisdom misses it.
155800	159660	The same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion.
159660	167360	Compassion has a sense of empathy about it, which implies self and other.
167480	169760	In compassion, there is no dualism.
169900	171420	There is no self or other.
172580	177140	And we translate dana as giving.
178360	180880	And that, too, misses the point.
181060	183060	Because giving is not dana.
183940	185880	Not quite dana.
189660	200220	There can be no dana, unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.
201420	205940	So that the giver and the receiver are unified.
206680	208080	They become one thing.
208300	209460	It's the same with compassion.
209600	212560	There's no doer or the thing that you're doing to.
213400	216580	There's no effort or even sense of it occurring.
216580	219860	Compassion happens the way your hair grows.
220420	221340	It's spontaneous.
221560	222660	There's no knowledge of it.
223720	225320	So dana is not charity.
226260	227700	And it's not generosity.
228700	234640	And it's not almsgiving or donation or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction.
235460	239520	It's not contribution or gift or philanthropy or offering.
239520	247280	But rather, it's the practice of total, unequivocal relinquishment.
250080	251480	What is relinquishment?
251660	252440	What does that mean?
253320	263880	The great master, Hui Hai, who was a successor of Basso, talked about it in a dialogue with one of his monks.
263880	270180	The monk asked, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?
271640	274060	The master said, by means of dana paramita.
275700	279420	According to the Buddha and the Bodhisattva path, the monk said,
280460	283920	the Bodhisattva path consists of six paramitas.
284060	285680	Why then have you mentioned only one?
285680	292760	Please explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter.
294440	300980	The master said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from dana paramita
300980	306540	and that it's by practice, by its practice, that all others are fulfilled.
307260	309920	Why it's the first one of the paramitas.
309920	313940	Why is it called dana paramita?
315820	318260	The answer, dana means relinquishment.
319040	321440	Question, relinquishment of what?
322220	325640	Answer, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.
326240	327120	What does that mean?
327500	328280	The monk asked.
329160	334500	It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,
335060	338660	being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,
338660	342020	concentration and distraction, pure and impure.
342580	349040	By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.
349780	356120	The real practice of dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of,
356680	362780	now I see that opposites are void, or now I have relinquished all of them.
362780	369240	We may also call it the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of current cause.
370140	375180	For it is when these are cut off that the whole dharma nature becomes void, empty.
375740	382060	And this emptiness of the dharma nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever.
382700	387080	Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned.
387080	387440	Why?
387440	395520	Because our self-nature is non-existent and does not contain a single thing foreign to itself.
396400	403840	That which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha.
404880	406520	It's said in the Diamond Sutra,
406680	411120	those who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas, or enlightened ones.
411120	419420	So basically what he's saying is that dana is about forgetting the self.
420380	424380	When there's no self, there's no other.
425240	429980	This is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected,
430640	432700	where all things are codependent,
433620	437800	where all things nourish each other and themselves.
437800	443460	Who forget the self is body and mind fallen away.
444480	450280	In our practice, giving and receiving is at the heart of almost everything that we do.
451960	455500	That's what our service is about.
456100	457380	Our liturgy is about.
458120	463380	We receive the teachings and we return gratitude.
463380	470980	We receive food and we acknowledge.
473300	476220	Therefore, we eat this food with everyone.
477280	480440	We eat to stop all evil, to practice good.
482020	483240	What's the next line?
484220	488340	Save all sentient beings and to accomplish the Buddha way.
488340	497600	So the receiving of the food, it's taken with the intent of giving, to follow it.
497820	500060	We receive the teachings and we give.
500260	501040	We return it.
502060	506740	So giving and receiving, the heart of that in Japanese Buddhism,
507200	509380	they have the practice of takahatsu.
509380	515500	And there they try to recreate that practice of giving and receiving,
516020	523440	where the monk begs for food and receives food
523440	528640	and then gives a chance something for the person that's given them the food.
529520	532800	And it's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified.
532800	544600	So the giving and receiving is constantly a manifestation of the interrelatedness,
544720	549840	codependency, mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra,
550060	556420	in which all things, every speck of dust in this vast universe is interrelated,
557120	560180	is codependent, has a mutual causality.
560180	563960	What happens to one thing happens to the totality of it.
564140	566440	Past, present, future.
566960	573980	That diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space
573980	576560	as well as the fourth dimension of time.
579420	584860	It's because that there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously
584860	586540	that it's never exhausted.
586540	590800	When it's really happening that way, it's never exhausted.
592300	601800	And that's why I've always felt that it's essential to people in the helping professions
601800	604920	to really understand what they're doing.
604920	612600	If they're not receiving while they're giving,
613600	617480	if they're doing something for somebody else,
617580	620840	if they're helping somebody else or saving somebody else,
620880	622180	it's all going in one direction.
623260	627760	If they have not yet understood that they are receiving,
627900	632100	that there's a possibility to be received, to receive something.
632100	634200	There is a mutual nourishment.
634400	636280	There is a mutual healing.
636720	641800	Healer and the healed are both healed in the process.
641920	645700	And when you understand that, you don't exhaust anything.
646660	650300	It's endless, boundless.
650300	661760	When I think back at the teachers that I've known in my time of practice,
661760	662680	I've seen that.
663220	666980	The real teachers have boundless energy, people say.
667780	669120	You know, what's the reservoir?
669340	670180	Where does it come from?
670240	671340	What do they plug into?
671800	675640	Well, they're plugged into the center of the universe itself.
675640	681320	That's where the nourishment comes from.
681820	684920	It's by the giving and receiving happening simultaneously.
685160	690260	Asatani Roshi was 88 years old or 89 years old.
690380	691400	Very, very sick.
692760	694400	Close to the end of his life.
695580	697380	Gaunt, weak, trembling.
697380	703320	He had to be helped by two Jesus to go to this Jukai ceremony.
704720	708500	The last Jukai ceremony that he did the day before he died.
710000	713120	And he couldn't even do his bows.
713600	714940	They helped him to his seat.
716480	719460	His voice was very weak as he introduced the whole thing.
719460	723860	And he offered the incense and began the ceremony.
725120	727520	And a lion appeared.
727720	729360	His voice became strong.
730640	736080	The power of his presence enveloped the entire group of people.
737040	743120	He completed the Jukai ceremony as if he were 30 years old instead of 88 years old.
743120	749460	And then relapsed into his being very weak and helped out of the place and everything.
751020	756400	That Jukai ceremony was filling him with energy.
757380	759520	What he was giving, he was receiving.
761360	764400	The next day, he never got out of bed.
765400	772280	He asked his attendant at one point while she was preparing breakfast to sit him up in bed
772280	774680	so he could sit in a Zazen posture.
775240	776880	When she came back, she found him dead.
778720	780660	Where did that energy come from?
781520	784160	It came from the very process of dhana.
784920	787920	And all of what we do is dhana.
793920	794960	Dogen says,
795760	800140	The self gives the self for the sake of giving the self.
800140	804880	The other gives the other for the sake of giving the other.
805960	807660	Giving is purposeless.
809140	815780	The karmic force of such giving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world.
815780	830740	So it's not dhana unless it's non-dual, no separation.
831700	837760	Dogen talks about dhana in terms of loving words,
838480	840680	working for the welfare of all beings,
840680	843460	and identity with others.
844420	849800	And his words are the best way of expressing them.
849860	850120	He says,
850180	853680	Loving speech means that as you meet sentient beings,
854840	857860	you first arouse a sense of compassion in your mind
857860	861340	and treat them with considerate and affectionate words.
862020	862960	Praise the virtuous.
863640	865040	Have compassion on the wicked.
865040	868920	As you take delight in affectionate words,
869020	870620	they will gradually flourish,
871480	874580	and then even those loving words,
874680	877840	which were hitherto unknown and unperceived,
878360	880080	will begin to reveal themselves.
882060	882880	Then he says,
882980	885480	in terms of working for the welfare of all beings,
885600	885880	he said,
885960	887560	Working for the welfare of all beings
887560	890040	means that you contrive ways to benefit
890040	892480	all sentient beings, high and low.
892480	896460	The practice of benefiting others is the total truth.
897340	900200	Hence, it serves both self and other far and wide.
901120	903520	Therefore, serve enemies and friends equally
903520	906820	and assist self and other without discrimination.
907800	909360	If you grasp this truth,
909440	912080	you will see that this is the reason
912080	916380	that even grass and trees,
916900	918080	the wind and water,
918080	920680	are all naturally engaged in the activity
920680	922480	of benefiting others.
923160	926580	And your understanding will certainly serve
926580	928040	others' benefit.
930500	931920	And then he says,
932160	933360	Identity with others.
934120	937180	Identity with others is non-differentiation,
937880	938660	non-duality.
939400	942160	This applies equally to the self and to others.
942160	946060	There is a truth that after the self
946060	948320	assimilates the other to itself,
948900	951660	the self lets itself be assimilated to the other.
952540	954740	This relationship of self and other
954740	957660	is infinitely varied according to the circumstances.
957660	967360	So, what Dogen's talking about,
968320	970940	what dana is directing itself to,
972620	974460	is the heart of being,
975640	978160	the vast net of existence
978160	980420	that we call the diamond net,
980420	985360	the virtue of and harmony
985360	987500	of the universe itself.
989640	991100	This is the nature
991100	993680	of all beings,
993800	995220	of all sentient beings.
995900	996600	It's there.
997960	999800	Each one of us has that
999800	1002240	ability, that potential.
1002240	1004500	but somehow
1004500	1007120	we cover it.
1008060	1010040	We cover it by our conditioning.
1011720	1013820	We cover it by our ideas
1013820	1014800	and notions.
1016020	1017080	By our sense,
1017840	1019360	the illusion of separateness.
1022620	1024060	There are many ways
1024060	1025080	to get to that.
1025680	1026140	And of course,
1026280	1026840	the heart of
1026840	1028900	and most important way
1028900	1030160	to get there is Zazen.
1030300	1031600	Zazen just peels back
1031600	1032980	the layers of those conditioning.
1033520	1034160	That conditioning
1034160	1035100	and underneath it
1035100	1036480	in that ground of being
1036480	1037000	is
1037000	1039700	the perfection of giving.
1040780	1041780	It's part of
1041780	1043740	our human characteristic.
1044640	1045380	It's part of
1045380	1045960	what it means
1045960	1046780	to be human.
1047140	1048000	It's part of
1048000	1048980	what it means
1048980	1051400	to be alive.
1053080	1054180	To be part of
1054180	1055100	this great earth,
1055400	1056040	all of it
1056040	1057480	is constantly
1057480	1058340	giving
1058340	1059500	and receiving.
1059880	1061060	Every aspect of it,
1061060	1061660	every atom,
1061760	1062560	every molecule.
1065060	1066140	There would be
1066140	1067200	no life
1067200	1067900	if it weren't
1067900	1068420	for that
1068420	1069660	giving and receiving,
1069800	1070920	that codependency.
1071080	1071500	Even if you
1071500	1072400	go down to
1072400	1073380	a molecular
1073380	1074540	or atomic level,
1074720	1075520	the relationship
1075520	1077360	between atoms
1077360	1078500	that makes a molecule,
1078500	1079700	that makes water,
1080500	1082080	is giving
1082080	1082760	and receiving.
1083600	1084480	It shares
1084480	1085260	the electrons.
1085400	1085820	It shares
1085820	1086440	the protons.
1086440	1087580	It creates
1087580	1088220	an entity
1088220	1089480	by the act
1089480	1089940	of giving
1089940	1090620	and receiving.
1090820	1091700	And so it is
1091700	1093560	from the molecular
1093560	1094580	atomic level
1094580	1095160	to the most
1095160	1096440	complex organisms,
1096620	1097660	including the universe
1097660	1098220	itself.
1098660	1099900	How can we ignore it?
1100900	1102260	How can we not
1102260	1102440	understand
1102440	1104280	that it's part
1104280	1105900	of what it means
1105900	1107080	to be in harmony
1107080	1107760	with the nature
1107760	1108540	of things?
1108540	1111400	The spring breeze
1111400	1112460	warms the earth
1112460	1113420	and brings the rain.
1114620	1116000	The earth offers up
1116000	1117380	plants and vegetation.
1119060	1120680	All of the earth's
1120680	1121300	creatures
1121300	1122620	breathe
1122620	1123920	the sweet air
1123920	1124600	that's produced
1124600	1125180	by this,
1125320	1126520	feed on the bounty
1126520	1127220	that's produced
1127220	1127840	by this,
1128400	1130320	and then they return
1130320	1131240	it to the earth.
1132920	1134040	Isn't all of that
1134040	1134480	dana?
1134480	1136360	giving
1136360	1137220	and receiving
1137220	1139140	in unity.
1141020	1141860	That's what
1141860	1142320	this weekend
1142320	1142960	is about.
1144140	1145080	All of what
1145080	1145720	I said
1145720	1148260	are the words
1148260	1149080	and the ideas
1149080	1150080	that describe it.
1151720	1152360	Tomorrow
1152360	1153360	you will have
1153360	1154060	an opportunity
1154060	1154980	to experience
1154980	1155420	it
1155420	1156640	yourself,
1157440	1158260	to practice
1158260	1158560	it
1158560	1159180	yourself.
1160500	1161480	You won't
1161480	1161900	even
1161900	1163460	taste it
1163460	1164580	or get
1164580	1165260	a glimmering
1165260	1165660	of it
1165660	1167500	if there's
1167500	1167900	any
1167900	1169040	self-centeredness
1169040	1169500	involved
1169500	1170020	in what you
1170020	1170280	do.
1171940	1172720	Abandon
1172720	1173340	the self.
1174140	1174520	Forget
1174520	1175200	the self
1175200	1175860	like you do
1175860	1176520	in Zazen
1176520	1178540	and give
1178540	1178940	freely.
1180100	1180820	Give yourself
1180820	1181880	freely.
1182620	1183260	Give yourself
1183260	1183880	away
1183880	1185440	freely.
1186980	1187540	Your heart,
1188720	1189360	your body,
1189940	1190460	your labor,
1191140	1192000	your presence,
1192420	1193020	your love,
1193460	1194140	your ear,
1195260	1195820	whatever
1195820	1196820	is needed.
1198300	1198800	And if you
1198800	1199300	do that,
1200360	1201040	you'll find
1201040	1201500	out
1201500	1203500	what the
1203500	1204020	Asatani
1204020	1204380	Roshi
1204380	1204880	knew
1204880	1206140	for many,
1206280	1206920	many years.
1209340	1210200	You'll find
1210200	1210560	out for
1210560	1210980	yourself.
1213460	1213720	So,
1214220	1214860	again,
1214980	1215480	thank you
1215480	1216260	for your
1216260	1216600	willingness
1216600	1218200	willingness to
1218200	1218720	be here,
1219480	1220100	to participate
1220100	1222020	in this
1222020	1223300	practice of
1223300	1223580	dana.
1224080	1224680	What happens
1224680	1224980	next,
1225060	1225360	boss?
1227160	1227520	Oh,
1227680	1228020	all right.
1229300	1229640	I didn't
1229640	1229840	want to,
1229880	1230520	I was late,
1230600	1230800	and I'm
1230800	1231420	sorry I was
1231420	1231680	late.
1231800	1232140	I was
1232140	1233840	busily making
1233840	1235660	notes and
1235660	1236360	lost track of
1236360	1236740	the time.
1237700	1237900	Yeah,
1237980	1238300	go ahead.
1238860	1239580	Any questions?
1239580	1239760	Any questions?
1239760	1244660	Peter?
1245180	1245420	Oh.
1247000	1247560	Okay.
1248120	1248860	Be easy on
1248860	1249000	me,
1249060	1249280	Peter.
1249560	1250320	Last time
1250320	1251280	you chewed
1251280	1251660	me up.
1251660	1254560	Is
1254560	1255080	the
1255080	1255760	dana dinner
1255760	1258320	Christmas
1258320	1259540	people
1259540	1261060	who don't
1261060	1261300	have
1261300	1261940	Christmas
1261940	1262580	or is
1262580	1263420	it just
1263420	1263820	for
1263820	1265800	dana dinner?
1267000	1267480	Well,
1267520	1267740	what does
1267740	1268220	dana dinner
1268220	1268700	mean to
1268700	1268980	you?
1270160	1270760	When you
1270760	1270980	say,
1271400	1272200	or is it
1272200	1272540	just
1272540	1273260	dana dinner?
1273460	1273600	So,
1273700	1274060	I need to
1274060	1274400	know what
1274400	1274820	you mean
1274820	1276480	by just
1276480	1277080	dana dinner.
1277080	1277460	I mean,
1277540	1278080	is it just
1278080	1278660	like that?
1279740	1280460	Is it just
1280460	1280900	a thing
1280900	1281320	that's
1281320	1286960	actually,
1287380	1287700	I mean,
1287760	1288120	what I've
1288120	1289120	been saying,
1289620	1290080	and let me
1290080	1290740	say it again
1290740	1291380	in a little
1291380	1292000	bit of a
1292000	1292640	different way,
1293760	1294320	what it
1294320	1295340	is for us
1295340	1296620	as Buddhists
1296620	1298540	here is
1298540	1299460	a way to
1299460	1301080	learn for
1301080	1301820	ourselves
1301820	1303380	what the
1303380	1305020	Buddha was
1305020	1305900	talking about,
1306980	1307660	what the
1307660	1308000	Buddha's
1308000	1308460	teachings
1308460	1310500	meant when
1310500	1310940	they talked
1310940	1311280	about
1311280	1311680	dana,
1312640	1313480	that dana
1313480	1316480	is an
1316480	1317300	act of
1317300	1318520	giving and
1318520	1320020	receiving at
1320020	1320400	the same
1320400	1320840	time.
1321820	1322580	It's like
1322580	1326000	when you
1326000	1328340	stub your
1328340	1328720	toe,
1329320	1331480	it needs
1331480	1331860	help,
1332620	1333340	and you
1333340	1333940	immediately
1333940	1334780	give,
1335120	1335800	you grab
1335800	1336320	your foot
1336320	1336760	and you
1336760	1337280	hop around
1337280	1337660	saying,
1337800	1337940	ooh,
1338080	1338380	ooh,
1338380	1338800	ooh,
1338800	1340440	and then
1340440	1341260	you receive,
1341560	1341960	you start
1341960	1342600	feeling better.
1344400	1345000	You
1345000	1347440	give the
1347440	1347980	nourishment,
1348180	1348360	you know,
1348400	1348860	you stroke
1348860	1349260	yourself,
1349720	1350460	and you
1350460	1351300	receive it
1351300	1352480	simultaneously.
1352480	1355000	so that's
1355000	1355720	what giving
1355720	1356520	and receiving
1356520	1357800	dana means
1357800	1358320	to a
1358320	1358660	Buddhist.
1359880	1360360	And
1360360	1361880	what we
1361880	1362460	want to
1362460	1363740	learn this
1363740	1364140	weekend
1364140	1365860	is how in
1365860	1366700	this process
1366700	1368100	of getting
1368100	1368720	together with
1368720	1369100	all these
1369100	1369500	people
1369500	1371740	to make
1371740	1372320	that work.
1372820	1373520	And if we
1373520	1374100	can make it
1374100	1375780	work here,
1377080	1377400	you know,
1377440	1378120	being very
1378120	1379200	aware of it
1379200	1379720	and conscious
1379720	1380200	of it,
1380200	1381100	maybe then
1381100	1381400	we can
1381400	1381700	make it
1381700	1382040	work in
1382040	1382480	the world.
1383360	1383720	So it's
1383720	1384100	not the
1384100	1384520	same as
1384520	1385440	walking along
1385440	1385840	and there's
1385840	1386360	some poor
1386360	1386920	guy on the
1386920	1387260	side of the
1387260	1387700	road that
1387700	1387980	says,
1388100	1388240	do you
1388240	1388620	have a
1388620	1389860	quarter for
1389860	1390280	a cup of
1390280	1390640	coffee?
1390760	1390920	And you
1390920	1391100	say,
1391200	1391460	sure,
1391600	1391840	here.
1392680	1393100	And they
1393100	1393280	say,
1393320	1393440	oh,
1393500	1393840	thank you
1393840	1394320	very much.
1394380	1394540	You say,
1394600	1395000	it's okay.
1395760	1396020	And they
1396020	1396400	go have a
1396400	1396680	cup of
1396680	1397040	coffee.
1397480	1397840	That's
1397840	1398420	charity.
1399040	1399380	So it's
1399380	1400140	not charity.
1401140	1401420	You know,
1401460	1401900	it's not
1401900	1403360	being a
1403360	1404060	benefactor.
1404400	1404920	It's not
1404920	1405280	making
1405280	1405880	yourself
1405880	1407560	higher,
1407880	1408180	bigger,
1408360	1408640	or more
1408640	1409000	important.
1409140	1409220	See,
1409220	1409500	when you
1409500	1410260	help somebody,
1410380	1411280	usually that
1411280	1412040	person is
1412040	1412800	down and
1412800	1413100	out and
1413100	1413300	you're
1413300	1413800	bigger and
1413800	1414240	stronger.
1415240	1416440	Donna makes
1416440	1417080	you the
1417080	1418960	same and
1418960	1421400	then completely
1421400	1422120	merged into
1422120	1422620	one thing.
1424220	1424760	So there's
1424760	1425340	only Peter
1425340	1426420	in the whole
1426420	1426940	universe.
1428000	1428960	He's swallowed
1428960	1429680	up everything.
1431420	1431680	Okay?
1432460	1433280	Anyone else?
1434900	1435760	Why do we do
1435760	1436260	it at Christmas?
1437620	1438600	We're actually,
1438600	1439380	I mean,
1439460	1439800	Christmas,
1440320	1442340	that holiday
1442340	1443480	time is,
1443700	1445860	I mean,
1445960	1446700	so obviously
1446700	1448040	universal.
1450080	1450360	You know,
1450760	1452320	they even make
1452320	1452820	a big deal
1452820	1453220	out of it in
1453220	1454040	Japan now.
1454540	1455220	And as time
1455220	1455960	goes on and
1455960	1456480	the earth
1456480	1457320	gets smaller,
1458040	1458840	all the
1458840	1459440	countries are
1459440	1459840	doing it,
1459940	1460580	even without
1460580	1462120	any relationship
1462120	1463020	to Christmas.
1463020	1464840	what they've
1464840	1466200	imported is
1466200	1466840	the worst
1466840	1467720	of what
1467720	1469280	the whole
1469280	1469680	thing is
1469680	1469980	about.
1470100	1470220	I mean,
1470260	1470640	the whole
1470640	1471920	concept of
1471920	1472620	Christ and
1472620	1473160	Christianity,
1473400	1474220	and it's the
1474220	1475060	Catholic Church's
1475060	1476640	fault for
1476640	1477140	doing that.
1477200	1477700	Christ wasn't
1477700	1478180	born in
1478180	1478540	December.
1478600	1478980	He was born
1478980	1479660	in March.
1480640	1480960	He's a
1480960	1481540	Pisces.
1481540	1484240	I have it
1484240	1484460	from,
1485100	1485520	yeah,
1485840	1486720	yeah,
1486760	1487240	he was.
1488680	1489300	I knew he
1489300	1489700	wasn't a
1489700	1490140	Capricorn.
1490920	1491480	Right.
1492600	1492880	Right.
1493460	1493760	I mean,
1493800	1494260	most of the,
1494340	1494500	I mean,
1494500	1495100	Buddha was a
1495100	1495940	Pisces too.
1498940	1499500	Gurjeev,
1499580	1499840	I mean,
1499840	1500200	a lot of
1500200	1500540	people,
1501360	1502000	spiritual
1502000	1502500	people.
1502500	1506440	so what's
1506440	1507320	happened is
1507320	1508240	what happened
1508240	1508760	is that
1508760	1509620	the Druids
1509620	1510320	had this
1510320	1511600	pagan holiday
1511600	1513160	which all
1513160	1513680	the things
1513680	1514540	that we
1514540	1515300	call Christmas
1515300	1515840	that people
1515840	1516480	know as
1516480	1517040	Christmas,
1517980	1518640	giving of
1518640	1519260	gifts,
1519520	1521400	the mistletoe,
1522140	1522840	the office
1522840	1523540	party,
1524480	1525780	getting
1525780	1526600	drunk,
1526920	1528140	all those
1528140	1528580	things were
1528580	1529080	part of
1529080	1529520	that
1529520	1531800	feast
1531800	1533820	of the
1533820	1534280	Druids
1534280	1535580	and people
1535580	1536280	continued to
1536280	1536700	do it
1536700	1537840	and so
1537840	1538620	the Catholic
1538620	1539760	Church
1539760	1541060	moved the
1541060	1541460	holiday
1541460	1542900	to that
1542900	1543420	time
1543420	1544860	hoping to
1544860	1545960	overcome it
1545960	1546380	with the
1546380	1547020	force of
1547020	1548580	the birth of
1548580	1549260	Christ and so
1549260	1549720	on but what
1549720	1550340	happened is
1550340	1551140	they merged
1551140	1551840	and became
1551840	1552460	a kind of
1552460	1553760	a mixture
1553760	1554180	of both.
1554280	1554620	Same thing
1554620	1555380	with Halloween.
1556160	1556680	Halloween,
1556980	1557520	I was reading
1557520	1558020	a thing,
1558220	1558520	I don't know
1558520	1559120	how true it
1559120	1559280	is,
1559480	1560240	it was put
1560240	1561020	out by the
1561020	1562740	born again
1562740	1563320	Christians,
1563800	1564640	how evil
1564640	1565720	Halloween is
1565720	1566060	and that
1566060	1566820	it's really
1566820	1567880	devil worshippers
1567880	1568640	and so on
1568640	1569400	and they
1569400	1569860	traced the
1569860	1570440	holiday back
1570440	1571160	also to a
1571160	1571900	Druid thing
1571900	1573320	and it had
1573320	1574020	to do with
1574020	1574700	the rising
1574700	1575500	of the dead
1575500	1575940	and the
1575940	1576980	worship of
1576980	1577940	demons
1577940	1578600	and stuff
1578600	1579220	like that
1579220	1581720	and there
1581720	1582080	was a lot
1582080	1582720	more to it
1582720	1583580	and they
1583580	1584740	made that
1584740	1586620	Hallow Eve
1586620	1587420	All Saints
1587420	1587740	Day
1587740	1588780	and that
1588780	1589120	too
1589120	1590320	ended up
1590320	1590980	kind of
1590980	1591420	a merge
1591420	1591980	thing.
1592100	1592680	So what
1592680	1594600	I'd like to
1594600	1595320	see us do
1595320	1595740	with that
1595740	1596340	same thing
1596340	1596800	and actually
1596800	1597480	we do this
1597480	1598160	close to the
1598160	1598660	solstice,
1598780	1599040	the winter
1599040	1599600	solstice,
1600320	1600820	I mean clearly
1600820	1601240	the winter
1601240	1602160	solstice is a
1602160	1602580	time for
1602580	1603200	celebration.
1603760	1604420	All cultures
1604420	1605600	celebrate the
1605600	1607240	various solstice
1607240	1608480	holidays and
1608480	1609100	equinoxes
1609100	1610320	because there
1610320	1611000	are times of
1611000	1611500	transition
1611500	1613140	and here
1613140	1614060	the solstice,
1614200	1614860	the days will
1614860	1615460	begin to get
1615460	1617060	longer and
1617060	1617700	the approach
1617700	1618300	of spring
1618300	1619240	is a cause
1619240	1620000	for celebration
1620000	1622960	and my
1622960	1623780	problem with
1623780	1625020	it is that
1625020	1626220	it has become
1626220	1628140	so awful
1628140	1631500	to go down
1631500	1632180	to the mall
1632180	1632760	and to see
1632760	1633440	the looks on
1633440	1634340	people's faces
1634340	1636160	they're in pain
1636160	1636940	they're in agony
1636940	1638340	and then to see
1638340	1639040	what happens
1639040	1639800	with the gifts
1639800	1641180	it's a gesture
1641180	1642580	it's not really
1642580	1643500	even giving
1643500	1644320	not even in the
1644320	1644980	remotest thing
1644980	1645520	for the most
1645520	1645880	part
1645880	1648500	and I'd like
1648500	1649020	to see what
1649020	1649580	the garbage
1649580	1650600	dumps look like
1650600	1651260	a week after
1651260	1651840	Christmas
1651840	1652840	with all the
1652840	1653340	things that get
1653340	1654140	thrown away
1654140	1655460	and all the
1655460	1656200	waste that's
1656200	1657160	created because
1657160	1657540	of it
1657540	1659480	and we're just
1659480	1660060	as bad
1660060	1660660	I mean we're
1660660	1661480	not much
1661480	1661840	better
1661840	1662780	but I'm
1662780	1664040	hoping this
1664040	1665380	year is where
1665380	1666160	it really struck
1666160	1668380	me that we
1668380	1669360	need to do
1669360	1670760	something to
1670760	1671680	make it a
1671680	1672160	little bit
1672160	1673440	more in
1673440	1674240	line with
1674240	1676340	what our
1676340	1676980	understanding
1676980	1678040	of Dana
1678040	1678860	is
1678860	1679940	in the
1679940	1680580	same way
1680580	1681480	that you
1681480	1681780	know you
1681780	1683020	can't
1683020	1684160	you can't
1684160	1684660	beat
1684660	1686260	the forces
1686260	1687740	of the
1687740	1688280	universe
1688280	1689960	by just
1689960	1690740	opposing them
1690740	1691120	you can't
1691120	1691500	just throw
1691500	1692120	up a barrier
1692120	1692900	so for
1692900	1693360	example
1693360	1694220	the media
1694220	1696340	has done
1696340	1697000	some awful
1697000	1697520	stuff
1697520	1698860	I mean the
1698860	1699640	reason there
1699640	1700960	is home
1700960	1701440	video
1701440	1703600	and interactive
1703600	1704580	CD-ROM
1704580	1705180	is because
1705180	1705920	of pornography
1705920	1707340	that's what
1707340	1707900	if it wasn't
1707900	1708660	for pornography
1708660	1709360	those things
1709360	1709860	never would
1709860	1710120	have been
1710120	1710400	born
1710400	1711700	that's the
1711700	1713040	multi-billion
1713040	1713880	dollar industry
1713880	1714640	that's underneath
1714640	1714980	it
1714980	1715800	so what do
1715800	1716200	you do
1716200	1716680	you say
1716680	1717000	okay
1717000	1718600	we won't
1718600	1719980	use CD-ROMs
1719980	1720300	and we'll
1720300	1720760	never look
1720760	1721240	at a video
1721240	1722880	that's not
1722880	1723380	the answer
1723380	1723860	to it
1723860	1725500	the media
1725500	1727720	is neutral
1727720	1728920	it's the
1728920	1729560	artists and
1729560	1729900	the people
1729900	1730380	that put it
1730380	1730740	together
1730740	1731300	that make
1731300	1732140	it what
1732140	1732660	it is
1732660	1733540	you know
1733540	1734060	it's like
1734060	1734780	condemning
1734780	1736680	cotton
1736680	1737260	or
1737260	1740520	metal
1740520	1741700	because it's
1741700	1742240	made into
1742240	1743260	a gun
1743260	1745220	how can we
1745220	1746000	use these
1746000	1746940	things in
1746940	1747580	a way that
1747580	1748220	nourishes
1748220	1748820	rather than
1748820	1749280	poisons
1749280	1750140	photography
1750140	1750960	is a
1750960	1751280	wonderful
1751280	1751760	media
1751760	1752880	it poisons
1752880	1754040	but it also
1754040	1754600	nourishes
1754600	1755040	and it
1755040	1755420	heals
1755420	1756360	and it
1756360	1756820	depends on
1756820	1757200	how you
1757200	1757640	use it
1757640	1758340	so I
1758340	1758640	think it's
1758640	1759200	the same
1759200	1759660	with a lot
1759660	1760040	of things
1760040	1760360	in our
1760360	1760820	society
1760820	1761140	they're not
1761140	1761320	going to
1761320	1761780	go away
1761780	1763060	so how
1763060	1763440	can we
1763440	1764000	use them
1764000	1765160	to nourish
1765160	1765660	and that's
1765660	1766380	basically what
1766380	1767080	we're exploring
1767080	1768340	with this
1768340	1769780	holiday
1769780	1771060	everybody's
1771060	1771560	already into
1771560	1772060	the holiday
1772060	1773340	and they're
1773340	1773680	going to do
1773680	1774260	it one way
1774260	1774620	or another
1774620	1775360	and the
1775360	1775780	people that
1775780	1776300	can't do
1776300	1776560	it
1776560	1778840	because of
1778840	1780200	circumstances
1780200	1781080	because they
1781080	1781900	don't have
1781900	1784680	the luxury
1784680	1785600	of choice
1785600	1786240	like we
1786240	1786660	have
1786660	1788200	become
1788200	1789000	despondent
1789000	1789600	and disturbed
1789600	1790160	by it
1790160	1791180	by not
1791180	1791900	having that
1791900	1792960	so this is
1792960	1793580	an opportunity
1793580	1794220	to do
1794220	1794920	something there
1794920	1795460	but to do
1795460	1796460	something in a
1796460	1797840	nourishing way
1797840	1798480	more positive
1798480	1798680	way
1798680	1806560	I think you
1806560	1806840	do
1806840	1807800	I've told
1807800	1808480	a lot of
1808480	1809040	my students
1809040	1809520	here the
1809520	1809980	story of
1809980	1810300	when I
1810300	1811140	first started
1811140	1812020	teaching
1812020	1813040	it was very
1813040	1813780	difficult for
1813780	1814540	me to have
1814540	1815360	what's called
1815360	1815860	an anja
1815860	1816940	an attendant
1816940	1818440	that takes
1818440	1819160	care of
1819160	1819900	the teacher
1819900	1821240	the reason
1821240	1821500	it was
1821500	1822180	difficult for
1822180	1822880	me is that
1822880	1824180	my father
1824180	1824720	died when I
1824720	1825040	was very
1825040	1825380	young
1825380	1827060	and we
1827060	1827660	were pretty
1827660	1828140	well all
1828140	1828580	family
1828580	1829860	and he
1829860	1830400	was a
1830400	1830920	politician
1830920	1832260	at the
1832260	1832940	state level
1832940	1834660	and my
1834660	1835520	mother was
1835520	1836080	you know
1836080	1836900	hostess to
1836900	1837240	all these
1837240	1837900	important people
1837900	1838260	and everything
1838260	1838640	and then he
1838640	1839040	died
1839040	1839840	didn't believe
1839840	1840420	in insurance
1840420	1840860	you know
1840860	1841340	this was
1841340	1842380	1939
1842380	1844480	and so he
1844480	1845020	left us
1845020	1845520	basically
1845520	1846220	penniless
1846220	1847320	my mother
1847320	1847840	had to go
1847840	1848420	to work
1848420	1849020	but she
1849020	1849500	really didn't
1849500	1849900	have any
1849900	1850260	skills
1850260	1850780	women in
1850780	1851180	those days
1851180	1851660	didn't
1851660	1853620	and so
1853620	1854060	she went
1854060	1854700	to school
1854700	1855740	and worked
1855740	1857140	and was
1857140	1858040	cleaning house
1858040	1860200	and avoiding
1860200	1862980	I mean she
1862980	1863500	was just too
1863500	1864020	proud to
1864020	1864480	take what
1864480	1864900	was called
1864900	1865340	relief
1865340	1865860	same as
1865860	1866280	welfare
1866280	1866660	now she
1866660	1867040	would never
1867040	1867580	take it
1867580	1870840	but I
1870840	1871240	would find
1871240	1871760	her crying
1871760	1872660	at night
1872660	1874280	because she
1874280	1875660	was cleaning
1875660	1876680	houses for
1876680	1877160	the people
1877160	1877600	that she
1877600	1877940	was the
1877940	1878820	hostess for
1878820	1880100	years before
1880100	1880800	you know
1880800	1881920	she was a
1881920	1882420	housekeeper
1882420	1885260	and it
1885260	1885960	really bothered
1885960	1887160	me that
1887160	1887740	I mean it
1887740	1888580	imprinted me
1888580	1889180	pretty deeply
1889180	1889660	I was nine
1889660	1890180	years old
1890180	1892160	later when I
1892160	1892680	got married
1892680	1893260	and was
1893260	1894420	making a
1894420	1894980	lot of
1894980	1895260	money
1895260	1897140	my wife
1897140	1897560	wanted a
1897560	1898060	housekeeper
1898060	1900320	and somebody
1900320	1900740	would come in
1900740	1901040	and actually
1901040	1901780	even cook for
1901780	1902560	us and I
1902560	1903320	kept resisting
1903320	1903980	it and then
1903980	1905000	finally I
1905000	1906440	agreed to
1906440	1906860	do it
1906860	1908700	and we'd
1908700	1909060	have this
1909060	1909860	woman come
1909860	1911000	in who
1911000	1911520	cleaned the
1911520	1912100	house and
1912100	1912760	would feed
1912760	1913200	the kids
1913200	1913540	and then
1913540	1914220	serve us
1914220	1914600	in another
1914600	1915020	room I
1915020	1915660	felt so
1915660	1916360	awful you
1916360	1916500	know I
1916500	1916900	kept thinking
1916900	1917200	of my
1917200	1919180	mother just
1919180	1919680	couldn't do
1919680	1920160	it you know
1920160	1921380	and so we
1921380	1922140	finally stopped
1922140	1922960	that big
1922960	1923800	arguments over
1923800	1925240	it so years
1925240	1925720	later I
1925720	1926160	become a
1926160	1927200	teacher and
1927200	1927700	part of being
1927700	1928600	a teacher is
1928600	1929320	you have a
1929320	1931100	group of
1931100	1932040	attendants a
1932040	1933620	personal
1933620	1934340	attendant a
1934340	1935780	secretary a
1935780	1936960	housekeeper and
1936960	1938880	all that but
1938880	1939460	I wasn't going to
1939460	1939900	do that
1939900	1942840	and so one
1942840	1943640	day my
1943640	1944180	teacher was
1944180	1944880	visiting me
1944880	1945480	and we're
1945480	1945740	at the
1945740	1946060	house and
1946060	1946400	I'm running
1946400	1947400	around serving
1947400	1948240	him cooking
1948240	1948780	getting his
1948780	1949180	ready he
1949180	1949880	says I
1949880	1950160	don't want
1950160	1950460	you to have
1950460	1951100	your Anja do
1951100	1952460	that and I
1952460	1953100	had been his
1953100	1954160	Anja and I
1954160	1954640	had been his
1954640	1955640	G ship so I
1955640	1956600	knew how to do
1956600	1958460	it so I said
1958460	1959120	no I don't have
1959120	1961320	an Anja proudly
1961320	1962740	a little bit of
1962740	1963800	pride no I
1963800	1964480	don't have an
1964480	1965360	Anja I'm a
1965360	1967400	regular guy he
1967400	1967940	said how can
1967940	1968440	you be so
1968440	1969040	selfish
1969040	1971160	I said why
1971160	1972400	he said what
1972400	1972780	do you mean
1972780	1973980	he said how
1973980	1974580	can you be so
1974580	1975560	selfish and not
1975560	1977340	allow your
1977340	1978200	students to
1978200	1978900	serve you to
1978900	1980440	give back to
1980440	1981340	you what you
1981340	1982000	give to them
1982000	1984680	and it changed
1984680	1986340	my whole notion
1986340	1986980	about that
1986980	1988860	and I suddenly
1988860	1989580	started doing
1989580	1990220	it I'm still
1990220	1991140	uncomfortable with
1991140	1992900	it but I
1992900	1993460	feel it's an
1993460	1994420	important part of
1994420	1995260	the whole process
1995260	1996060	that they need
1996060	1996920	to otherwise
1996920	1997560	they become
1997560	1998940	thieves they
1998940	2000720	take and
2000720	2001040	don't give
2001040	2001320	and they
2001320	2001920	feel awful
2001920	2002540	about it
2002540	2003580	they want
2003580	2003800	to
2003800	2004680	students want
2004680	2005740	to give
2005740	2006200	back
2006200	2007220	I know I
2007220	2007700	did when I
2007700	2008100	was serving
2008100	2008520	my teacher
2008520	2009260	I felt great
2009260	2010280	but we used
2010280	2010740	to fight
2010740	2011300	over who
2011300	2011640	could do
2011640	2012340	it
2012340	2013560	what about
2013560	2013580	what about
2013580	2013900	if you're
2013900	2014360	on the end
2014360	2014900	of wanting
2014900	2015720	to give
2015720	2016200	back
2016200	2018860	say that
2018860	2019060	again
2019060	2019880	are you
2019880	2020520	stuck
2020520	2021340	not
2021340	2022200	having
2022200	2022760	Donna
2022760	2024140	if the
2024140	2024760	other person
2024760	2025720	doesn't give
2025720	2026080	back
2026080	2026760	or is there
2026760	2027040	something
2027040	2028140	that you
2028140	2028460	can
2028460	2028960	oh no
2028960	2029940	they don't
2029940	2030800	it's not
2030800	2031940	there's no
2031940	2032960	conscious giving
2032960	2033800	on their part
2033800	2035160	there's no
2035160	2035360	conscious
2035360	2036000	I mean
2036000	2036720	Lenny
2036720	2037480	mentioned
2037480	2038260	last night
2038260	2038660	when we were
2038660	2039260	at the prison
2039260	2040160	and I
2040160	2040880	mentioned it
2040880	2041340	before
2041340	2042260	every time
2042260	2042620	we go to
2042620	2043120	the prison
2043120	2044260	to work
2044260	2044500	with the
2044500	2044820	prisoners
2044820	2045220	you know
2045220	2046120	we're like
2046120	2046620	the heroes
2046620	2047180	we come in

2047500	2047860	outside
2047860	2048800	and we're
2048800	2050660	doing something
2050660	2051080	for them
2051080	2051520	we're bringing
2051520	2052060	the Dharma
2052060	2052520	to them
2052520	2052940	and everything
2052940	2054200	and by the
2054200	2054660	time we're
2054660	2055020	finished
2055020	2055760	we're all
2055760	2056520	walking away
2056520	2056920	with our
2056920	2057580	tails between
2057580	2057960	our legs

2094220	2095520	you know
2095520	2096120	your breath
2096120	2097060	so it
2097060	2097740	comes up
2097740	2099620	any thought

2109920	2110200	to the
2110200	2110540	moment
2110540	2113380	I mean
2113380	2114060	it's
2114060	2115220	it's
2115220	2115900	when I
2115900	2116100	say
2116100	2116820	nourishment
2116820	2117860	to be
2117860	2118520	nourished
2118520	2120020	it's kind
2120020	2120460	of a
2120460	2121080	vague
2121080	2122300	intangible
2122300	2123700	term
2123700	2125840	but I've
2125840	2126860	talked about
2126860	2128540	nourishment
2128540	2129420	in terms
2129420	2130160	of photography
2130160	2130900	for example
2130900	2131520	or in
2131520	2131900	terms of
2131900	2132200	art
2132200	2132840	or music
2132840	2134900	there is
2134900	2135420	art
2135420	2136460	that poisons
2136460	2138300	and there's
2138300	2138820	art that
2138820	2139460	nourishes
2139460	2141420	art that
2141420	2142020	poisons
2142020	2144660	is art
2144660	2145120	that when
2145120	2145360	you've
2145360	2146000	experienced
2146000	2146200	it
2146200	2146700	a photograph
2146700	2147540	a painting
2147540	2148080	piece of
2148080	2148540	music
2148540	2150160	and then
2150160	2150720	walk away
2150720	2151100	from it
2151100	2151720	you feel
2151720	2152160	as if
2152160	2152400	you've
2152400	2152620	lost
2152620	2153080	something
2153080	2154100	something
2154100	2154440	has
2154440	2157460	been taken
2157460	2157940	away
2157940	2160000	art that
2160000	2160520	nourishes
2160520	2161800	when you
2161800	2162300	walk away
2162300	2162840	from it
2162840	2163940	you feel
2163940	2164600	that you've
2164600	2165140	received
2165140	2165640	something
2165640	2166740	you feel
2166740	2168420	nicer
2168420	2169000	better
2169000	2170480	greater
2170480	2171520	so
2171520	2172180	nourishment
2172180	2172660	is what
