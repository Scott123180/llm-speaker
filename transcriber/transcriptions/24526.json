{"text": " Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will take place tomorrow. And our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county. And I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is. We translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all. And we have that problem with the English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings. And as a result, they become misinterpreted. And that's why many of them we retain in the original form, such as Donna. Donna is one of the paramitas. There are six paramitas. And these paramitas have been in existence a long time. They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of. And Donna is the first of those. And each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you somehow miss what they're about. For example, we translate Prajna paramita. Paramita literally means other shore or to cross over. And our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now. Prajna, we translate as wisdom. And wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about accumulating knowledge. It's not what Prajna means. It has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it have anything to do with knowing. So that the calling it wisdom misses it. The same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion. Compassion has a sense of empathy about it, which implies self and other. In compassion, there is no dualism. There is no self or other. And we translate dana as giving. And that, too, misses the point. Because giving is not dana. Not quite dana. There can be no dana, unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously. So that the giver and the receiver are unified. They become one thing. It's the same with compassion. There's no doer or the thing that you're doing to. There's no effort or even sense of it occurring. Compassion happens the way your hair grows. It's spontaneous. There's no knowledge of it. So dana is not charity. And it's not generosity. And it's not almsgiving or donation or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction. It's not contribution or gift or philanthropy or offering. But rather, it's the practice of total, unequivocal relinquishment. What is relinquishment? What does that mean? The great master, Hui Hai, who was a successor of Basso, talked about it in a dialogue with one of his monks. The monk asked, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered? The master said, by means of dana paramita. According to the Buddha and the Bodhisattva path, the monk said, the Bodhisattva path consists of six paramitas. Why then have you mentioned only one? Please explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter. The master said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from dana paramita and that it's by practice, by its practice, that all others are fulfilled. Why it's the first one of the paramitas. Why is it called dana paramita? The answer, dana means relinquishment. Question, relinquishment of what? Answer, relinquishment of dualism of opposites. What does that mean? The monk asked. It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure. By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty. The real practice of dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of, now I see that opposites are void, or now I have relinquished all of them. We may also call it the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of current cause. For it is when these are cut off that the whole dharma nature becomes void, empty. And this emptiness of the dharma nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever. Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned. Why? Because our self-nature is non-existent and does not contain a single thing foreign to itself. That which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha. It's said in the Diamond Sutra, those who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas, or enlightened ones. So basically what he's saying is that dana is about forgetting the self. When there's no self, there's no other. This is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected, where all things are codependent, where all things nourish each other and themselves. Who forget the self is body and mind fallen away. In our practice, giving and receiving is at the heart of almost everything that we do. That's what our service is about. Our liturgy is about. We receive the teachings and we return gratitude. We receive food and we acknowledge. Therefore, we eat this food with everyone. We eat to stop all evil, to practice good. What's the next line? Save all sentient beings and to accomplish the Buddha way. So the receiving of the food, it's taken with the intent of giving, to follow it. We receive the teachings and we give. We return it. So giving and receiving, the heart of that in Japanese Buddhism, they have the practice of takahatsu. And there they try to recreate that practice of giving and receiving, where the monk begs for food and receives food and then gives a chance something for the person that's given them the food. And it's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified. So the giving and receiving is constantly a manifestation of the interrelatedness, codependency, mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra, in which all things, every speck of dust in this vast universe is interrelated, is codependent, has a mutual causality. What happens to one thing happens to the totality of it. Past, present, future. That diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space as well as the fourth dimension of time. It's because that there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously that it's never exhausted. When it's really happening that way, it's never exhausted. And that's why I've always felt that it's essential to people in the helping professions to really understand what they're doing. If they're not receiving while they're giving, if they're doing something for somebody else, if they're helping somebody else or saving somebody else, it's all going in one direction. If they have not yet understood that they are receiving, that there's a possibility to be received, to receive something. There is a mutual nourishment. There is a mutual healing. Healer and the healed are both healed in the process. And when you understand that, you don't exhaust anything. It's endless, boundless. When I think back at the teachers that I've known in my time of practice, I've seen that. The real teachers have boundless energy, people say. You know, what's the reservoir? Where does it come from? What do they plug into? Well, they're plugged into the center of the universe itself. That's where the nourishment comes from. It's by the giving and receiving happening simultaneously. Asatani Roshi was 88 years old or 89 years old. Very, very sick. Close to the end of his life. Gaunt, weak, trembling. He had to be helped by two Jesus to go to this Jukai ceremony. The last Jukai ceremony that he did the day before he died. And he couldn't even do his bows. They helped him to his seat. His voice was very weak as he introduced the whole thing. And he offered the incense and began the ceremony. And a lion appeared. His voice became strong. The power of his presence enveloped the entire group of people. He completed the Jukai ceremony as if he were 30 years old instead of 88 years old. And then relapsed into his being very weak and helped out of the place and everything. That Jukai ceremony was filling him with energy. What he was giving, he was receiving. The next day, he never got out of bed. He asked his attendant at one point while she was preparing breakfast to sit him up in bed so he could sit in a Zazen posture. When she came back, she found him dead. Where did that energy come from? It came from the very process of dhana. And all of what we do is dhana. Dogen says, The self gives the self for the sake of giving the self. The other gives the other for the sake of giving the other. Giving is purposeless. The karmic force of such giving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world. So it's not dhana unless it's non-dual, no separation. Dogen talks about dhana in terms of loving words, working for the welfare of all beings, and identity with others. And his words are the best way of expressing them. He says, Loving speech means that as you meet sentient beings, you first arouse a sense of compassion in your mind and treat them with considerate and affectionate words. Praise the virtuous. Have compassion on the wicked. As you take delight in affectionate words, they will gradually flourish, and then even those loving words, which were hitherto unknown and unperceived, will begin to reveal themselves. Then he says, in terms of working for the welfare of all beings, he said, Working for the welfare of all beings means that you contrive ways to benefit all sentient beings, high and low. The practice of benefiting others is the total truth. Hence, it serves both self and other far and wide. Therefore, serve enemies and friends equally and assist self and other without discrimination. If you grasp this truth, you will see that this is the reason that even grass and trees, the wind and water, are all naturally engaged in the activity of benefiting others. And your understanding will certainly serve others' benefit. And then he says, Identity with others. Identity with others is non-differentiation, non-duality. This applies equally to the self and to others. There is a truth that after the self assimilates the other to itself, the self lets itself be assimilated to the other. This relationship of self and other is infinitely varied according to the circumstances. So, what Dogen's talking about, what dana is directing itself to, is the heart of being, the vast net of existence that we call the diamond net, the virtue of and harmony of the universe itself. This is the nature of all beings, of all sentient beings. It's there. Each one of us has that ability, that potential. but somehow we cover it. We cover it by our conditioning. We cover it by our ideas and notions. By our sense, the illusion of separateness. There are many ways to get to that. And of course, the heart of and most important way to get there is Zazen. Zazen just peels back the layers of those conditioning. That conditioning and underneath it in that ground of being is the perfection of giving. It's part of our human characteristic. It's part of what it means to be human. It's part of what it means to be alive. To be part of this great earth, all of it is constantly giving and receiving. Every aspect of it, every atom, every molecule. There would be no life if it weren't for that giving and receiving, that codependency. Even if you go down to a molecular or atomic level, the relationship between atoms that makes a molecule, that makes water, is giving and receiving. It shares the electrons. It shares the protons. It creates an entity by the act of giving and receiving. And so it is from the molecular atomic level to the most complex organisms, including the universe itself. How can we ignore it? How can we not understand that it's part of what it means to be in harmony with the nature of things? The spring breeze warms the earth and brings the rain. The earth offers up plants and vegetation. All of the earth's creatures breathe the sweet air that's produced by this, feed on the bounty that's produced by this, and then they return it to the earth. Isn't all of that dana? giving and receiving in unity. That's what this weekend is about. All of what I said are the words and the ideas that describe it. Tomorrow you will have an opportunity to experience it yourself, to practice it yourself. You won't even taste it or get a glimmering of it if there's any self-centeredness involved in what you do. Abandon the self. Forget the self like you do in Zazen and give freely. Give yourself freely. Give yourself away freely. Your heart, your body, your labor, your presence, your love, your ear, whatever is needed. And if you do that, you'll find out what the Asatani Roshi knew for many, many years. You'll find out for yourself. So, again, thank you for your willingness willingness to be here, to participate in this practice of dana. What happens next, boss? Oh, all right. I didn't want to, I was late, and I'm sorry I was late. I was busily making notes and lost track of the time. Yeah, go ahead. Any questions? Any questions? Peter? Oh. Okay. Be easy on me, Peter. Last time you chewed me up. Is the dana dinner Christmas people who don't have Christmas or is it just for dana dinner? Well, what does dana dinner mean to you? When you say, or is it just dana dinner? So, I need to know what you mean by just dana dinner. I mean, is it just like that? Is it just a thing that's actually, I mean, what I've been saying, and let me say it again in a little bit of a different way, what it is for us as Buddhists here is a way to learn for ourselves what the Buddha was talking about, what the Buddha's teachings meant when they talked about dana, that dana is an act of giving and receiving at the same time. It's like when you stub your toe, it needs help, and you immediately give, you grab your foot and you hop around saying, ooh, ooh, ooh, and then you receive, you start feeling better. You give the nourishment, you know, you stroke yourself, and you receive it simultaneously. so that's what giving and receiving dana means to a Buddhist. And what we want to learn this weekend is how in this process of getting together with all these people to make that work. And if we can make it work here, you know, being very aware of it and conscious of it, maybe then we can make it work in the world. So it's not the same as walking along and there's some poor guy on the side of the road that says, do you have a quarter for a cup of coffee? And you say, sure, here. And they say, oh, thank you very much. You say, it's okay. And they go have a cup of coffee. That's charity. So it's not charity. You know, it's not being a benefactor. It's not making yourself higher, bigger, or more important. See, when you help somebody, usually that person is down and out and you're bigger and stronger. Donna makes you the same and then completely merged into one thing. So there's only Peter in the whole universe. He's swallowed up everything. Okay? Anyone else? Why do we do it at Christmas? We're actually, I mean, Christmas, that holiday time is, I mean, so obviously universal. You know, they even make a big deal out of it in Japan now. And as time goes on and the earth gets smaller, all the countries are doing it, even without any relationship to Christmas. what they've imported is the worst of what the whole thing is about. I mean, the whole concept of Christ and Christianity, and it's the Catholic Church's fault for doing that. Christ wasn't born in December. He was born in March. He's a Pisces. I have it from, yeah, yeah, he was. I knew he wasn't a Capricorn. Right. Right. I mean, most of the, I mean, Buddha was a Pisces too. Gurjeev, I mean, a lot of people, spiritual people. so what's happened is what happened is that the Druids had this pagan holiday which all the things that we call Christmas that people know as Christmas, giving of gifts, the mistletoe, the office party, getting drunk, all those things were part of that feast of the Druids and people continued to do it and so the Catholic Church moved the holiday to that time hoping to overcome it with the force of the birth of Christ and so on but what happened is they merged and became a kind of a mixture of both. Same thing with Halloween. Halloween, I was reading a thing, I don't know how true it is, it was put out by the born again Christians, how evil Halloween is and that it's really devil worshippers and so on and they traced the holiday back also to a Druid thing and it had to do with the rising of the dead and the worship of demons and stuff like that and there was a lot more to it and they made that Hallow Eve All Saints Day and that too ended up kind of a merge thing. So what I'd like to see us do with that same thing and actually we do this close to the solstice, the winter solstice, I mean clearly the winter solstice is a time for celebration. All cultures celebrate the various solstice holidays and equinoxes because there are times of transition and here the solstice, the days will begin to get longer and the approach of spring is a cause for celebration and my problem with it is that it has become so awful to go down to the mall and to see the looks on people's faces they're in pain they're in agony and then to see what happens with the gifts it's a gesture it's not really even giving not even in the remotest thing for the most part and I'd like to see what the garbage dumps look like a week after Christmas with all the things that get thrown away and all the waste that's created because of it and we're just as bad I mean we're not much better but I'm hoping this year is where it really struck me that we need to do something to make it a little bit more in line with what our understanding of Dana is in the same way that you know you can't you can't beat the forces of the universe by just opposing them you can't just throw up a barrier so for example the media has done some awful stuff I mean the reason there is home video and interactive CD-ROM is because of pornography that's what if it wasn't for pornography those things never would have been born that's the multi-billion dollar industry that's underneath it so what do you do you say okay we won't use CD-ROMs and we'll never look at a video that's not the answer to it the media is neutral it's the artists and the people that put it together that make it what it is you know it's like condemning cotton or metal because it's made into a gun how can we use these things in a way that nourishes rather than poisons photography is a wonderful media it poisons but it also nourishes and it heals and it depends on how you use it so I think it's the same with a lot of things in our society they're not going to go away so how can we use them to nourish and that's basically what we're exploring with this holiday everybody's already into the holiday and they're going to do it one way or another and the people that can't do it because of circumstances because they don't have the luxury of choice like we have become despondent and disturbed by it by not having that so this is an opportunity to do something there but to do something in a nourishing way more positive way I think you do I've told a lot of my students here the story of when I first started teaching it was very difficult for me to have what's called an anja an attendant that takes care of the teacher the reason it was difficult for me is that my father died when I was very young and we were pretty well all family and he was a politician at the state level and my mother was you know hostess to all these important people and everything and then he died didn't believe in insurance you know this was 1939 and so he left us basically penniless my mother had to go to work but she really didn't have any skills women in those days didn't and so she went to school and worked and was cleaning house and avoiding I mean she was just too proud to take what was called relief same as welfare now she would never take it but I would find her crying at night because she was cleaning houses for the people that she was the hostess for years before you know she was a housekeeper and it really bothered me that I mean it imprinted me pretty deeply I was nine years old later when I got married and was making a lot of money my wife wanted a housekeeper and somebody would come in and actually even cook for us and I kept resisting it and then finally I agreed to do it and we'd have this woman come in who cleaned the house and would feed the kids and then serve us in another room I felt so awful you know I kept thinking of my mother just couldn't do it you know and so we finally stopped that big arguments over it so years later I become a teacher and part of being a teacher is you have a group of attendants a personal attendant a secretary a housekeeper and all that but I wasn't going to do that and so one day my teacher was visiting me and we're at the house and I'm running around serving him cooking getting his ready he says I don't want you to have your Anja do that and I had been his Anja and I had been his G ship so I knew how to do it so I said no I don't have an Anja proudly a little bit of pride no I don't have an Anja I'm a regular guy he said how can you be so selfish I said why he said what do you mean he said how can you be so selfish and not allow your students to serve you to give back to you what you give to them and it changed my whole notion about that and I suddenly started doing it I'm still uncomfortable with it but I feel it's an important part of the whole process that they need to otherwise they become thieves they take and don't give and they feel awful about it they want to students want to give back I know I did when I was serving my teacher I felt great but we used to fight over who could do it what about what about if you're on the end of wanting to give back say that again are you stuck not having Donna if the other person doesn't give back or is there something that you can oh no they don't it's not there's no conscious giving on their part there's no conscious I mean Lenny mentioned last night when we were at the prison and I mentioned it before every time we go to the prison to work with the prisoners you know we're like the heroes we come in from the outside and we're doing something for them we're bringing the Dharma to them and everything and by the time we're finished we're all walking away with our tails between our legs because we've received so much it seems so lopsided you know and it's not it's not that physically they're saying okay you gave me this now I'm going to give you this it's just that it happens by the it's like making love you know nobody's thinking about okay you kiss me and I'll kiss you and you touch me I'll touch you you know you just do it the birds do it and the bees do it anybody else well you practice that the way you practice you know your breath so it comes up any thought I'm good I'm bad I'm Santa Claus you acknowledge it throw it away come back to the moment I mean it's it's when I say nourishment to be nourished it's kind of a vague intangible term but I've talked about nourishment in terms of photography for example or in terms of art or music there is art that poisons and there's art that nourishes art that poisons is art that when you've experienced it a photograph a painting piece of music and then walk away from it you feel as if you've lost something something has been taken away art that nourishes when you walk away from it you feel that you've received something you feel nicer better greater so nourishment is what I hope spiritual nourishment to take away as well as some pretty good food I mean those turkeys are nothing to scoff at you're the last one Peter you started and you're going to close it go ahead say that last line again you gave thanks to her what doesn't make any well the best one to talk to about that I guess is guess who I mean I'm a father and I feel good when my kids feel good so whenever I can do something to help my kids I mean they're all you would think they were old people now you know they're like 38 39 years old but even now I mean I when I see that they're happy I'm happy my mother used to say that to me you know when I would do all the crazy things that I've done in my life like become a Zen Buddhist my mother's a Catholic you know I'm a Zen Buddhist monk and she said well what's a Zen Buddhist monk I said well you know it's this and that what do you do what do they pay you nothing where do you you know and she said and then it all would end with well if it makes you happy son it makes me happy and she really meant it you know so that's the way parents are pretty weird you'll find out one of these days I hope thank you oh go ahead one more really 63 for make believe I have another age 65 my 65 age is the one that technically I am that is I'm a Pisces I was born in February 26 1930 but my real age I'm a Gemini and I was born in 1931 so I have two ages I think so as far as I'm concerned they weren't thank you everybody", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.5, "text": " Thank you for being here this weekend and being part
