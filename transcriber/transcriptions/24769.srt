Koans of the Way of Reality, Case 108.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The Great Pearls, Dana, Prologue.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Giving generously means non-greed, not withholding.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
One phrase, one verse, the ten thousand things, the hundred grasses.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
One Dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Since the beginningless beginning, there has never been a single thing to withhold.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When the Way is relinquished to the Way, the Way is realized.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When the Way is realized, the Way is manifested through itself.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When the self gives the self simply for the sake of giving, the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How can this truth be realized?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How can this truth be realized?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Listen to this old teaching.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The main case.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A monk asked the Great Pearl.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
By means of Dhanaparamita, the Great Pearl said.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
According to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path comprises six Paramitas.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why then have you mentioned only one?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The Great Pearl said.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And that by its practice, all the others are fulfilled.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The monk said, why is it called Dhanaparamita?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The teacher said, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The monk asked, relinquishment of what?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The teacher answered, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The capping, capping verse.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You may understand it, but in vain.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You may believe it, but it's to no avail.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You may describe it, but it still remains a description.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ultimately, how is it?

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The river doesn't understand, yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The mountain has no words, yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is here that the sweet innocence of Dhanaparamita is revealed.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As most of you, as I look around the room, I realize that most of you have been here for the weekend, so you were part of the whole Dhanaparamita thing yesterday.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But there are also some that weren't here, so some of what I did as opening remarks to the Dhanaparamita, or the Perfection of Giving weekend, I'd like to repeat so that it's clear to everyone.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Dhana, we translate, for those of you that are new to the term, as giving.

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Although giving doesn't quite reach it.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's more than just something going from A to B.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the same as in the transmission of the Dharma.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We call it Dhanaparamita, and paramita means the practice of perfection, or crossing over to the other shore.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And these paramitas are part of Mahayana Buddhism.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And in Zen, we understand the crossing over to the other shore as either the other shore and this shore are the same, or rather the other shore arrives.

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, Dhanaparamita is understood loosely as the perfection of giving.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And as all of you must have realized yesterday in the process of doing that weekend,

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
that the teachers of this weekend were really the people that arrived on the buses.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You'd have to be totally blind and without any sensibility at all not to have received an incredible amount of teaching from our guests the weekend.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And that's at the heart of what Dhana is about.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There can be no Dhana unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's the heart of Dhana.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It goes both ways.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It must go both ways.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There can be no Dhana unless the giver and the receiver are unified, or become one reality in the process.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So, therefore, Dhana is not charity.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not generosity.

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not almsgiving, or donation, or beneficence, or benevolence, or benefaction, or contribution, gift, philanthropy, offering.

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Dhana is the practice of total relinquishment.

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Relinquishment.

70
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that's what the great pearl was talking about.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Total relinquishment.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Letting go.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Not holding on to anything.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
All the dualities must dissolve.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And needless to say, when all the dualities dissolve, each of those paramitas, each of the six paramitas are there.

76
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Dhana, or giving, or the perfection of giving, is found throughout the Mahayana literature.

77
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It appears in the precepts.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
For example, be generous, do not be withholding.

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's Dhana.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It appears in the eight awarenesses of an enlightened person, the 52 aspects of a bodhisattva.

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It appears in the paramitas.

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It appears as part of the morality, the three basic teachings of the Buddha, one of which was morality.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So it's obviously considered by Buddhists to be one of the most important virtues.

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It is the characteristic of a bodhisattva.

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's the life of a bodhisattva.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And in the prologue it says, giving generously means non-greed.

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And if you really look at greed, you realize that greed is exactly the opposite.

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Greed is about holding on.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And dhana is about letting go, not withholding, not holding back.

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then the prologue says, one phrase, one verse, ten thousand things, the hundred grasses,

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
one dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors, since the beginning.

92
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There has never been a single thing to withhold.

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So that's the ultimate truth that underlies the whole thing.

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We may proceed through the world with an illusion of separateness,

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
with the illusion that the self and other are separate things.

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But the fact is, there is no separation to begin with.

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's why we call dharma, the ten thousand things, purity itself.

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's nothing extraneous.

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There's no outside.

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's all unified, whether we've realized it or not.

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we haven't realized it and we proceed on the assumption that there's a self and other separation,

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
then we run into all kinds of difficulties.

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's what the pain and suffering of this life is about.

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's what we call samsara.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, if you haven't realized it, although it's true,

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you're not going in accord with that realization.

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When you realize it or when you practice in accord with the truth of that unity,

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
then it's a whole different way of living your life.

109
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There has never been a single thing to withhold.

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because each one of us, this very body and mind, your very body and mind,

111
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is the body and mind of the universe.

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Where would you hold it?

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And who would you give it to?

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And then the prologue says, when the way is relinquished to the way,

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
when you give the way to the way, the Tao, to the Tao,

116
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the way is realized.

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
When the way is realized, the way is manifested through itself.

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, the way begins to manifest itself through itself when you've realized the way.

119
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What does it mean to have realized the way?

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It means to have unified with the way.

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When you are the way itself, the way manifests through itself,

122
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
which is none other than manifesting through you.

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And that's what the next line means.

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
When the self gives the self simply for the sake of giving,

125
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Again, that's about unification, no separation.

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's no reason for it.

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's no merit attached to it.

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's simply the way the universe is.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And so, the giving is simply for the sake of giving, for no other reason.

131
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You can wash the dishes in order to have clean dishes.

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That makes it functional.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There's a purpose.

134
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's a process.

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And there's a result.

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or, you can wash the dishes to wash the dishes.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just for the simple sake of washing the dishes.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, the cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heaven and encompasses the earth.

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That is, it is the nature of things.

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Whether we've realized it for ourselves or not.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's the nature of things.

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, this monk, in the main case, comes up to the great pearl.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And the great pearl is the successor of Matsu, the great master Basa, who had 84 enlightened disciples that he transmitted to.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wei Hai is one of those disciples.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
His name in Japanese is Daishu.

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Daishu means great pearl.

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Ikai.

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He got the name great pearl because he first began studying with...

149
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He was first ordained by another teacher.

150
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And then went to study with Matsu and studied with him for a while.

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then the...

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
His first teacher became very ill.

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And so, he left Matsu and went back to take care of his old teacher.

154
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And while he was back there, he wrote a discourse.

155
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I'm trying to remember what that discourse was.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I guess it was a discourse on sudden elimination.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And a monk who was there took that treatise to Matsu.

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And when Matsu read it, he said, there is a great pearl on that mountain.

159
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And although he had the name Ikai, it was the name Daishu or great pearl that kind of stuck with him.

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So, this monk asked the great pearl, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?

161
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And he answered, by means of Dhanaparamita.

162
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And this koan is not a koan in the usual sense of the word.

163
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It tends to be very explanatory.

164
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And I think the reason is that it arose from a mundo rather than a dharmakambat, shosan.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Dharma combats tend to be more direct pointing, more head squeezing.

166
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Mondos tend to be intellectual and explanatory.

167
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And this is kind of intellectual and explanatory.

168
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it has some value because of his particular way of expressing it that I thought was important for us to use and to treat it as a koan.

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, he says, by means of Dhanaparamita.

170
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, the monk said, according to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas.

171
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why then have you mentioned only one?

172
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the great pearl said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita.

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And it's by the practice, by its practice, the practice of giving, that all the others are fulfilled.

174
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And in a sense, you can say that for any of the paramitas.

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can say that for any of the precepts.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can say that for the eight gates of Zen.

177
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That in each one of them, the other are contained.

178
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And if you realize any one of them fully, you've realized that.

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In fact, you can say that of any koan.

180
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That if you exhaust the koan completely, thoroughly,

181
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:42,000
all of the ramifications and permutations and combination of a single koan, you've realized all of the koans.

182
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And then the monk says, why is it called Dhanaparamita?

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And he answers, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Relinquishment of what?

185
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.

186
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad.

187
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The being and non-being.

188
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Love and aversion.

189
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Void and non-void.

190
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Concentration and distraction.

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Pure and impure.

192
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

193
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Now, we've talked about this a hundred thousand times in the fifteen years we've been here.

194
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You know, these dual, these so-called opposites.

195
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That every one of them are two parts of the same reality.

196
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That because they are mutually arising,

197
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
because they're codependent, that is, one cannot exist without the other,

198
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
we can choose to see them as opposite, but we can also see them as codependent, mutually arising.

199
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You can't have one without the other.

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You can't have good without bad.

201
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can't have being without non-being.

202
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can't have love without aversion.

203
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Or form without emptiness.

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They're mutually arising.

205
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It doesn't make sense, one of them.

206
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Heads and tails are two parts of the same coin.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You can't have a coin that says heads.

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So, it's because of the difference that they can arise.

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So, we can understand them as two separate things, a la the differences,

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
or, because of their codependency, the same thing.

211
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's what the gashow is.

212
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
When we gashow and bring together the palms and bow to each other,

213
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
we're acknowledging the unity of these two things becoming one thing.

214
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's what the bow also is.

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We bow to the sugar, and we bow to the shower, and we bow to each other,

216
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and before entering a room, and all of that precedes that action.

217
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:10,000
All of that acknowledges that the action is, in reality, one thing, not two.

218
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Now, that being the case, and I've talked about this before,

219
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
our tendency is we get caught up in that duality,

220
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and we want to move away from the thing that's not good to the thing that's good.

221
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We want to get rid of evil altogether and just have good.

222
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We want to get rid of sickness and just have health.

223
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We want to get rid of old age and just have young age.

224
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We want to get rid of bad and have good.

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We want to move away from one and go toward the other.

226
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And we've built a society and a technology, a multi-trillion dollar business of selling to the people,

227
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
getting rid of one and going to the other.

228
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know, take this and you'll be healthy.

229
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Take this and you'll stay young forever.

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Take this and everybody will love you.

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Nobody will hate you.

232
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But, of course, there's no way that you can do that.

233
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's no way that you can get rid of one and have only the other.

234
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
They're two parts of the same reality.

235
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So, ultimately, what the whole thing comes down to, as I've mentioned before,

236
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is not so much a matter of annihilating one side and having the other side,

237
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but rather a process of navigation or what we call the middle way.

238
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's the same way that you take a canoe down a river.

239
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The river is filled with all kinds of obstructions, rocks, bad, freeway, good.

240
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So, I want the freeway and I want to hit the rocks.

241
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And so you learn to navigate the river.

242
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But rivers have a characteristic of changing constantly.

243
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I mean, look at the map of any river that's two years old

244
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and then check out that river and you'll find that it's a very different river.

245
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Every spring, it becomes a new river.

246
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Its bends and twists and turns and so on

247
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
happen in accord with the amount of rain and the terrain and so on.

248
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So, it's hard to make a map for it,

249
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
just like it's hard to make a map for how to live your life.

250
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So, in order to navigate a river, you need to learn to read the river.

251
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You need to know how to manage the equipment, the canoe.

252
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
More importantly, you need to be one with that canoe.

253
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You need to respond to the river like a canoe responds to the river.

254
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And you need to be very alert, aware, very conscious, very centered,

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
with single-pointedness of mind.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You get distracted just for a minute, you know.

257
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You examine your fingernails and you've hit something, turned over.

258
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All your equipment is now being carried down the river.

259
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So, you need to be there, but without tension.

260
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you do it with a lot of tension,

261
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
it's okay if you're doing, you know, a mile of whitewater.

262
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But if you're doing ten miles of whitewater,

263
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you'll get so exhausted by the time you've gotten halfway through it

264
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that you begin to lose all of that awareness and focus and so on.

265
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So, you need to be able to do it without exhausting yourself.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And all of that is a perfect metaphor for life.

267
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How to live one's life.

268
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
How to discern the middle way.

269
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
How to be able to navigate and respond to circumstances as they come up.

270
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There's no warning ahead of time, you know.

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There's no map in the world that's going to show you that, overnight,

272
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
a tree has just fallen across the river.

273
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And you're coming down at a goodly clip.

274
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The river is carrying you full speed.

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And you come around this bend.

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And there you are.

277
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There's no passage.

278
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
There's a tree that's completely covering.

279
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And its branches are hanging down like this.

280
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And you have to respond.

281
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What do you do?

282
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's kind of interesting.

283
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And it happens.

284
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
All the time.

285
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So, it's the same with our life.

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
There's no way to predict what's around the next bend.

287
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There's no way to predict what the next barrier will be that we encounter.

288
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So, all we can do is develop the skills for working with the barriers that come up.

289
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And that's what practice is.

290
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's all it is.

291
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Those skills are based on an underlying realization of the nature of things, of the nature of the self.

292
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So, all the things we talk about are explanations of what the underlying truth is that can be realized.

293
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And when you realize it, the explanations are useless.

294
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The precepts are useless.

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
All the paramitas are useless because they become a manifestation of your own life.

296
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You don't need that kind of explanation anymore.

297
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You spontaneously respond in accord with things.

298
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.

299
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I added some footnotes to this, starting off with a question that the monk asked.

300
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?

301
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The footnote says, what gate?

302
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Where is he?

303
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What's he saying?

304
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Where is there a gate?

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:25,000
A gate means that there's some place that's inside the gate and outside the gate.

306
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's like when Nansen said the Tao is not an outside thing.

307
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Joshua comes up and says, well, what's the, what is the, it's not an outside thing.

308
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So what's the Tao, what is the Tao of outside things?

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
If the Tao is not an outside thing, then there must be another Tao.

310
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And of course, Nansen knew that.

311
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And as well as Joshua knew that.

312
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
There's no inside and outside.

313
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
There's no point of entry.

314
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It reaches everywhere.

315
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So right off, you can see where this monk is coming from.

316
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And the great pearl was being very, he may have known something about this monk.

317
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Maybe the monk was at a point in his practice where he needed explanations.

318
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But somebody comes, come looking for a gate.

319
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I would approach very differently.

320
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The next question, the next statement.

321
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He says, by means of Dhanaparamita.

322
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The footnote says, unavoidably, this will lead to more doubt.

323
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
More questions.

324
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And still, he must respond.

325
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And then the monk says, according to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path has six paramitas.

326
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why do you mention only one?

327
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Footnote says, this one alone?

328
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What's he talking about?

329
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What's he talking about?

330
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
One.

331
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And then the great pearl says, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dana.

332
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And that by its practice, all the others are fulfilled.

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The footnote says, what's the old man doing?

334
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Don't create complications.

335
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The more he feeds this guy words, the more the guy produces words.

336
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why is it called Dana?

337
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Footnote says, be generous.

338
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Give him the stick.

339
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Drive him out.

340
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dana means relinquishment.

341
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The master answers.

342
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Where is this going, the footnote says.

343
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Let's see some relinquishment.

344
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The next line, relinquishment of what?

345
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Footnote says, everything.

346
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Shut up and sit.

347
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But the master, being very compassionate and grandmotherly, says, relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.

348
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Footnote says, too bad.

349
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He's up to his nostrils in mud.

350
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And the monk says, what does that mean?

351
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And the old man says, it means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure.

352
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
By giving up all of them, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

353
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Footnote says, I think he's drowned this monk with his words.

354
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But say, did the monk get it?

355
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Do you get it?

356
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Basically, what he's talking about when he says relinquishment of all things is letting go.

357
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Letting go.

358
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And letting go, you know, comes up again and again.

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We talk about it endlessly.

360
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's definitely part of the whole new age vernacular and everybody says it.

361
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But what does it really mean?

362
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Usually what it means when people hear the word non-attachment, they simply conclude it means not caring.

363
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.

364
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They think it means not loving, not caring.

365
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:49,000
All the way back into the 50s, that was the way the beat zen expressed itself.

366
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't know.

367
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't care.

368
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And it doesn't matter anyway.

369
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That was the, you know, the three truths of beat zen.

370
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, you know, the only, only people that don't do zazen can make statements like that with red books.

371
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Of course, we care.

372
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And of course, it matters.

373
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Not attachment doesn't mean not caring and not loving.

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It means caring very much and loving very much.

375
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You can't really love unless there is non-attachment.

376
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So long as there's attachment, what you have is two things.

377
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
By the very nature of attachment, you have to have the attachee and the attachor.

378
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That's two.

379
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
When these two merge, there can no longer be attachment.

380
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
There's nothing to attach to and no one to do the attaching.

381
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That's what love is.

382
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No separation.

383
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's what caring is.

384
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No separation.

385
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That's what dana is.

386
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
No separation.

387
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's what realization is.

388
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No separation.

389
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Whether we're talking about people or sound or form.

390
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Form.

391
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's what Dogen meant when he said seeing form with the whole body and mind.

392
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
One understands it intimately.

393
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Hearing sound with the whole body and mind.

394
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
One understands it intimately.

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That intimacy is realization.

396
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's unity.

397
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It's one thing.

398
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So we call it letting go, non-attachment, forget the self, empty the mind, no mind, non-dual dharma, merging of differences.

399
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Wonderful.

400
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But how do you get there?

401
00:31:47,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Well, you know, you can recite it in your head a hundred thousand times and try desperately to do it.

402
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And, you know, you can do it.

403
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know, empathy is a kind of a practice in that direction.

404
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But keep in mind, empathy with someone is still separation.

405
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's not yet unity.

406
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Unity.

407
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's the difference between doing good and compassion.

408
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
In doing good, there's still separation.

409
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
In compassion, there's no sense of doer or the person that's being done.

410
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Self and other.

411
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Or act of doing.

412
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It just happens.

413
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Spontaneously.

414
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The way the spring breeze warms the earth.

415
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It doesn't know what it's doing.

416
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
The earth doesn't know about the spring breeze.

417
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So how do we do it?

418
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Well, no matter how you cut it in this practice,

419
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
no matter where you look to it,

420
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
no matter what the teachings are,

421
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
if we're talking about liturgy or the precepts or art practice, body practice, koans,

422
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,000
whatever it is, it all comes down to the old furnace of zazen.

423
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The process of falling away of body and mind.

424
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And we begin that process by working with the body,

425
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and then with the breath,

426
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and then the mind.

427
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And as the process gets deeper,

428
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and the body falls away,

429
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
off sensation of the body.

430
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Mind is still functioning.

431
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You know you're there.

432
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You're watching the breath.

433
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're feeling the breath.

434
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And then you disappear into the breath.

435
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The breath is just breathing itself.

436
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's no longer an observer watching.

437
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Mind falls away.

438
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's what Dogen meant

439
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
in that little,

440
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
those few little lines that encompasses the totality of our practice.

441
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
To study the Buddha way is to study the self.

442
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You start with all the stuff.

443
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All the stuff that we call our self.

444
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The bag of skin.

445
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Everything inside it is me,

446
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and everything outside it is the rest of the universe.

447
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That's the illusion.

448
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And we start with that illusion.

449
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And study it.

450
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And layer by layer,

451
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
we begin digging at it.

452
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The layers of conditioning.

453
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Conditioning of parents,

454
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
teachers,

455
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
culture,

456
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
education,

457
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
peers.

458
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Conditioning that began at birth,

459
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and has continued through our life,

460
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
and is constantly reinforced,

461
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
day after day,

462
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
by our media,

463
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and our literature,

464
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and our politics,

465
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and sociology,

466
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and science,

467
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and religion.

468
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
constantly reinforces the illusion of separateness,

469
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
of two things.

470
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And we work with that.

471
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Layer by layer,

472
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
examining it and letting it go.

473
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Until we get to that ground of being.

474
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
We learn the practice of letting go,

475
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
moment to moment,

476
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in zazen.

477
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's why it's so critical.

478
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Seems simple, you know.

479
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Thought comes up,

480
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
let it go,

481
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
come back to the breath.

482
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Well,

483
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
what you're learning is how to let go.

484
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And there's nothing as sweet,

485
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
or as juicy as our own thoughts.

486
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We love them.

487
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We hang on to them.

488
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
All the beautiful fantasies,

489
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
all the beautiful ideas,

490
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
all the brilliant words.

491
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's hard to let go of them.

492
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Non-attachment doesn't mean abandoning them.

493
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It means not attaching,

494
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
not holding on.

495
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And layer by layer, we let go.

496
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We get to that ground of being.

497
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So to study the self is to forget the self.

498
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Once you get rid of all of the aggregates,

499
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
what is it that remains?

500
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
When the self is forgotten,

501
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
what is it that remains?

502
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Dogen says it in the next line,

503
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
to forget the self is to realize the 10,000 dharmas.

504
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
When you forget the self,

505
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
what remains,

506
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
when there's no longer a self,

507
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
is the 10,000 dharmas,

508
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
is everything.

509
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The whole universe.

510
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But there's no longer a barrier between you and it.

511
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You are it.

512
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The skin bag

513
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
either has embraced the totality of it,

514
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
or has just disappeared.

515
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
However you look at it,

516
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it doesn't matter.

517
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
There's the merging.

518
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The merging is even extra.

519
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
There's the realization that there never was a separation.

520
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And in each aspect of those eight stages of,

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
eight gates of practice,

522
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that same thing is functioning.

523
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Non-dual.

524
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So in the face-to-face teaching,

525
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
no separation is at the heart of it.

526
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
In our academic study,

527
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
not attaching to the words.

528
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Our tendency in academic study is to want to hold on to the words.

529
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
We need to read it,

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
hear it,

531
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
throw it away,

532
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and keep going.

533
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Even in practice,

534
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
we need to realize it,

535
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
throw it away,

536
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
and keep going.

537
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Whatever it is.

538
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And ultimately,

539
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
we come to the peak of the mountain.

540
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Enlightenment.

541
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Realize it,

542
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
throw it away,

543
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and keep going.

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
If you hold on to anything,

545
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you've created that dualism again.

546
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So that's why we emphasize,

547
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
not only material things,

548
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
even spiritual things.

549
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If you hold on to it,

550
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
you create an illusion of separateness,

551
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and it's diluted.

552
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Liturgy is also the process of giving.

553
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We constantly give in liturgy our gratitude,

554
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
our appreciation for the teachings.

555
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We receive the teachings,

556
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
we give the gratitude.

557
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The precepts are another example of

558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that non-dual dharma,

559
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
no-self.

560
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
They're based on no-self.

561
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They're based on no-self

562
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and designed to function in the world of differences.

563
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's what I mean.

564
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You can't,

565
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you can't deny existence.

566
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The Buddha way is beyond

567
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
being and non-being.

568
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It doesn't fall into either side of it.

569
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
In art practice,

570
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the same thing.

571
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The brush paints itself.

572
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Body practice,

573
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the dance dances itself.

574
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
In all of these,

575
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
self is forgotten.

576
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But one of the things that's going to be happening soon,

577
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
we're coming to our 15th anniversary,

578
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and we've also just received notification recently

579
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
that the monastery building and its grounds

580
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
has been recognized by New York State

581
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
as a historical site.

582
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And it's also been recognized nationally

583
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
as a national historic site.

584
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And this will give us an opportunity

585
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
to do fundraising to restore this building,

586
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
to do a major restoration project

587
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
as well as other things that we need.

588
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And so we'll be launching a capital campaign,

589
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
a major fund drive.

590
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I just want to say to the people

591
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
who are going to be doing this fund drive

592
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
that if it's going to be charity,

593
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
it's not going to work.

594
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If it's going to be generosity,

595
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
it's not going to work.

596
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Or beneficence,

597
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
or donation,

598
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
or contribution,

599
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
or gift,

600
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
or philanthropy,

601
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
it's not going to work.

602
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The people

603
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that will give

604
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
must also receive.

605
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Otherwise, it's not dana.

606
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Very important.

607
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So the question is

608
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
to really make clear

609
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
both sides of that.

610
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Form is emptiness.

611
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Emptiness is form.

612
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Form is exactly emptiness.

613
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Emptiness exactly form.

614
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's the same with all dualities.

615
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The capping verse.

616
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You may understand it,

617
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
but it's all in vain.

618
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You may believe it,

619
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
but it's to no avail.

620
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You may describe it,

621
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but it still remains a description.

622
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Ultimately,

623
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
how is it?

624
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The river doesn't understand,

625
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and yet it knows how to give itself

626
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to the great ocean.

627
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The mountain has no words,

628
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
yet it gives birth

629
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
to the ten thousand things.

630
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It is here

631
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that the sweet innocence

632
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
of dana

633
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
is realized.

634
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You see that in children,

635
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
that sweet innocence of giving.

636
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and that's the way it should be.

637
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's the way it should be.

638
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
.

639
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
.

640
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
.

641
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
.

642
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
.

643
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
.

644
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
.

645
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
.

646
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
.
