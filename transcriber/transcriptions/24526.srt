00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will take place tomorrow.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,000
And our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:38,900
And I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is.

4
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:50,280
We translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:06,160
And we have that problem with the English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings.

6
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,600
And as a result, they become misinterpreted.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,340
And that's why many of them we retain in the original form, such as Donna.

8
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,560
Donna is one of the paramitas.

9
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,280
There are six paramitas.

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,820
And these paramitas have been in existence a long time.

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,060
They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of.

12
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,780
And Donna is the first of those.

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,720
And each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you somehow miss what they're about.

14
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,900
For example, we translate Prajna paramita.

15
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,460
Paramita literally means other shore or to cross over.

16
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:09,680
And our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now.

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,440
Prajna, we translate as wisdom.

18
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,780
And wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about accumulating knowledge.

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,780
It's not what Prajna means.

20
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,460
It has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it have anything to do with knowing.

21
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,540
So that the calling it wisdom misses it.

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,660
The same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion.

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,360
Compassion has a sense of empathy about it, which implies self and other.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,760
In compassion, there is no dualism.

25
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,420
There is no self or other.

26
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,140
And we translate dana as giving.

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,880
And that, too, misses the point.

28
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,060
Because giving is not dana.

29
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,880
Not quite dana.

30
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:20,220
There can be no dana, unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,940
So that the giver and the receiver are unified.

32
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,080
They become one thing.

33
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,460
It's the same with compassion.

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,560
There's no doer or the thing that you're doing to.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,580
There's no effort or even sense of it occurring.

36
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,860
Compassion happens the way your hair grows.

37
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,340
It's spontaneous.

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,660
There's no knowledge of it.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,320
So dana is not charity.

40
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,700
And it's not generosity.

41
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,640
And it's not almsgiving or donation or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction.

42
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,520
It's not contribution or gift or philanthropy or offering.

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,280
But rather, it's the practice of total, unequivocal relinquishment.

44
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
What is relinquishment?

45
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,440
What does that mean?

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:23,880
The great master, Hui Hai, who was a successor of Basso, talked about it in a dialogue with one of his monks.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,180
The monk asked, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?

48
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,060
The master said, by means of dana paramita.

49
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,420
According to the Buddha and the Bodhisattva path, the monk said,

50
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,920
the Bodhisattva path consists of six paramitas.

51
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,680
Why then have you mentioned only one?

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,760
Please explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter.

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,980
The master said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from dana paramita

54
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,540
and that it's by practice, by its practice, that all others are fulfilled.

55
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,920
Why it's the first one of the paramitas.

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,940
Why is it called dana paramita?

57
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,260
The answer, dana means relinquishment.

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Question, relinquishment of what?

59
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,640
Answer, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
What does that mean?

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,280
The monk asked.

62
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,500
It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,

63
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,660
being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,

64
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,020
concentration and distraction, pure and impure.

65
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:49,040
By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

66
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,120
The real practice of dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of,

67
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,780
now I see that opposites are void, or now I have relinquished all of them.

68
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:09,240
We may also call it the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of current cause.

69
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,180
For it is when these are cut off that the whole dharma nature becomes void, empty.

70
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,060
And this emptiness of the dharma nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever.

71
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,080
Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned.

72
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,440
Why?

73
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,520
Because our self-nature is non-existent and does not contain a single thing foreign to itself.

74
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,840
That which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha.

75
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
It's said in the Diamond Sutra,

76
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,120
those who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas, or enlightened ones.

77
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,420
So basically what he's saying is that dana is about forgetting the self.

78
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,380
When there's no self, there's no other.

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,980
This is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected,

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,700
where all things are codependent,

81
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,800
where all things nourish each other and themselves.

82
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,460
Who forget the self is body and mind fallen away.

83
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,280
In our practice, giving and receiving is at the heart of almost everything that we do.

84
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,500
That's what our service is about.

85
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,380
Our liturgy is about.

86
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,380
We receive the teachings and we return gratitude.

87
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:50,980
We receive food and we acknowledge.

88
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,220
Therefore, we eat this food with everyone.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,440
We eat to stop all evil, to practice good.

90
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,240
What's the next line?

91
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,340
Save all sentient beings and to accomplish the Buddha way.

92
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:17,600
So the receiving of the food, it's taken with the intent of giving, to follow it.

93
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,060
We receive the teachings and we give.

94
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,040
We return it.

95
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,740
So giving and receiving, the heart of that in Japanese Buddhism,

96
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,380
they have the practice of takahatsu.

97
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,500
And there they try to recreate that practice of giving and receiving,

98
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:43,440
where the monk begs for food and receives food

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,640
and then gives a chance something for the person that's given them the food.

100
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,800
And it's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified.

101
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:04,600
So the giving and receiving is constantly a manifestation of the interrelatedness,

102
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,840
codependency, mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra,

103
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,420
in which all things, every speck of dust in this vast universe is interrelated,

104
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,180
is codependent, has a mutual causality.

105
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,960
What happens to one thing happens to the totality of it.

106
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,440
Past, present, future.

107
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,980
That diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space

108
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,560
as well as the fourth dimension of time.

109
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,860
It's because that there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously

110
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,540
that it's never exhausted.

111
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,800
When it's really happening that way, it's never exhausted.

112
00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:01,800
And that's why I've always felt that it's essential to people in the helping professions

113
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,920
to really understand what they're doing.

114
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,600
If they're not receiving while they're giving,

115
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,480
if they're doing something for somebody else,

116
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,840
if they're helping somebody else or saving somebody else,

117
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,180
it's all going in one direction.

118
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,760
If they have not yet understood that they are receiving,

119
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,100
that there's a possibility to be received, to receive something.

120
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,200
There is a mutual nourishment.

121
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,280
There is a mutual healing.

122
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,800
Healer and the healed are both healed in the process.

123
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,700
And when you understand that, you don't exhaust anything.

124
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,300
It's endless, boundless.

125
00:10:50,300 --> 00:11:01,760
When I think back at the teachers that I've known in my time of practice,

126
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,680
I've seen that.

127
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,980
The real teachers have boundless energy, people say.

128
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,120
You know, what's the reservoir?

129
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,180
Where does it come from?

130
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,340
What do they plug into?

131
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,640
Well, they're plugged into the center of the universe itself.

132
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,320
That's where the nourishment comes from.

133
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,920
It's by the giving and receiving happening simultaneously.

134
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,260
Asatani Roshi was 88 years old or 89 years old.

135
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,400
Very, very sick.

136
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,400
Close to the end of his life.

137
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,380
Gaunt, weak, trembling.

138
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,320
He had to be helped by two Jesus to go to this Jukai ceremony.

139
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,500
The last Jukai ceremony that he did the day before he died.

140
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
And he couldn't even do his bows.

141
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,940
They helped him to his seat.

142
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,460
His voice was very weak as he introduced the whole thing.

143
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,860
And he offered the incense and began the ceremony.

144
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,520
And a lion appeared.

145
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
His voice became strong.

146
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,080
The power of his presence enveloped the entire group of people.

147
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,120
He completed the Jukai ceremony as if he were 30 years old instead of 88 years old.

148
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,460
And then relapsed into his being very weak and helped out of the place and everything.

149
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,400
That Jukai ceremony was filling him with energy.

150
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,520
What he was giving, he was receiving.

151
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,400
The next day, he never got out of bed.

152
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,280
He asked his attendant at one point while she was preparing breakfast to sit him up in bed

153
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,680
so he could sit in a Zazen posture.

154
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,880
When she came back, she found him dead.

155
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,660
Where did that energy come from?

156
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,160
It came from the very process of dhana.

157
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,920
And all of what we do is dhana.

158
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
Dogen says,

159
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,140
The self gives the self for the sake of giving the self.

160
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,880
The other gives the other for the sake of giving the other.

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,660
Giving is purposeless.

162
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,780
The karmic force of such giving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world.

163
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:50,740
So it's not dhana unless it's non-dual, no separation.

164
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,760
Dogen talks about dhana in terms of loving words,

165
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,680
working for the welfare of all beings,

166
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,460
and identity with others.

167
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,800
And his words are the best way of expressing them.

168
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,120
He says,

169
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,680
Loving speech means that as you meet sentient beings,

170
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,860
you first arouse a sense of compassion in your mind

171
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,340
and treat them with considerate and affectionate words.

172
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,960
Praise the virtuous.

173
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,040
Have compassion on the wicked.

174
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,920
As you take delight in affectionate words,

175
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,620
they will gradually flourish,

176
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,580
and then even those loving words,

177
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,840
which were hitherto unknown and unperceived,

178
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,080
will begin to reveal themselves.

179
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,880
Then he says,

180
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,480
in terms of working for the welfare of all beings,

181
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:45,880
he said,

182
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,560
Working for the welfare of all beings

183
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,040
means that you contrive ways to benefit

184
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,480
all sentient beings, high and low.

185
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,460
The practice of benefiting others is the total truth.

186
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,200
Hence, it serves both self and other far and wide.

187
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,520
Therefore, serve enemies and friends equally

188
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,820
and assist self and other without discrimination.

189
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,360
If you grasp this truth,

190
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,080
you will see that this is the reason

191
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,380
that even grass and trees,

192
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,080
the wind and water,

193
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,680
are all naturally engaged in the activity

194
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,480
of benefiting others.

195
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,580
And your understanding will certainly serve

196
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,040
others' benefit.

197
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,920
And then he says,

198
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,360
Identity with others.

199
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,180
Identity with others is non-differentiation,

200
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,660
non-duality.

201
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,160
This applies equally to the self and to others.

202
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,060
There is a truth that after the self

203
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,320
assimilates the other to itself,

204
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,660
the self lets itself be assimilated to the other.

205
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,740
This relationship of self and other

206
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,660
is infinitely varied according to the circumstances.

207
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:07,360
So, what Dogen's talking about,

208
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,940
what dana is directing itself to,

209
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,460
is the heart of being,

210
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,160
the vast net of existence

211
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,420
that we call the diamond net,

212
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,360
the virtue of and harmony

213
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,500
of the universe itself.

214
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,100
This is the nature

215
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,680
of all beings,

216
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,220
of all sentient beings.

217
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,600
It's there.

218
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,800
Each one of us has that

219
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,240
ability, that potential.

220
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,500
but somehow

221
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,120
we cover it.

222
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,040
We cover it by our conditioning.

223
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,820
We cover it by our ideas

224
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,800
and notions.

225
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,080
By our sense,

226
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,360
the illusion of separateness.

227
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,060
There are many ways

228
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,080
to get to that.

229
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,140
And of course,

230
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,840
the heart of

231
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,900
and most important way

232
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,160
to get there is Zazen.

233
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
Zazen just peels back

234
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,980
the layers of those conditioning.

235
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,160
That conditioning

236
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,100
and underneath it

237
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,480
in that ground of being

238
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,000
is

239
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
the perfection of giving.

240
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
It's part of

241
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,740
our human characteristic.

242
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,380
It's part of

243
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,960
what it means

244
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,780
to be human.

245
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,000
It's part of

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,980
what it means

247
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,400
to be alive.

248
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,180
To be part of

249
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,100
this great earth,

250
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,040
all of it

251
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,480
is constantly

252
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,340
giving

253
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,500
and receiving.

254
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,060
Every aspect of it,

255
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,660
every atom,

256
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,560
every molecule.

257
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,140
There would be

258
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,200
no life

259
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,900
if it weren't

260
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,420
for that

261
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,660
giving and receiving,

262
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,920
that codependency.

263
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,500
Even if you

264
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,400
go down to

265
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,380
a molecular

266
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,540
or atomic level,

267
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,520
the relationship

268
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,360
between atoms

269
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,500
that makes a molecule,

270
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,700
that makes water,

271
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,080
is giving

272
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,760
and receiving.

273
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,480
It shares

274
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,260
the electrons.

275
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,820
It shares

276
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,440
the protons.

277
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,580
It creates

278
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,220
an entity

279
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,480
by the act

280
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,940
of giving

281
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,620
and receiving.

282
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,700
And so it is

283
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,560
from the molecular

284
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,580
atomic level

285
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,160
to the most

286
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,440
complex organisms,

287
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,660
including the universe

288
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,220
itself.

289
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,900
How can we ignore it?

290
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,260
How can we not

291
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,440
understand

292
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,280
that it's part

293
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,900
of what it means

294
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,080
to be in harmony

295
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,760
with the nature

296
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,540
of things?

297
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,400
The spring breeze

298
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,460
warms the earth

299
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,420
and brings the rain.

300
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,000
The earth offers up

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,380
plants and vegetation.

302
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,680
All of the earth's

303
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,300
creatures

304
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,620
breathe

305
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,920
the sweet air

306
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,600
that's produced

307
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,180
by this,

308
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,520
feed on the bounty

309
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,220
that's produced

310
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,840
by this,

311
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
and then they return

312
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,240
it to the earth.

313
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
Isn't all of that

314
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,480
dana?

315
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,360
giving

316
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,220
and receiving

317
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,140
in unity.

318
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,860
That's what

319
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,320
this weekend

320
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,960
is about.

321
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,080
All of what

322
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,720
I said

323
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,260
are the words

324
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,080
and the ideas

325
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
that describe it.

326
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,360
Tomorrow

327
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
you will have

328
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,060
an opportunity

329
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,980
to experience

330
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,420
it

331
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,640
yourself,

332
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,260
to practice

333
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,560
it

334
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,180
yourself.

335
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,480
You won't

336
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,900
even

337
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,460
taste it

338
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,580
or get

339
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,260
a glimmering

340
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,660
of it

341
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,500
if there's

342
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,900
any

343
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,040
self-centeredness

344
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,500
involved

345
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,020
in what you

346
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,280
do.

347
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,720
Abandon

348
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,340
the self.

349
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,520
Forget

350
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,200
the self

351
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,860
like you do

352
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,520
in Zazen

353
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,540
and give

354
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:38,940
freely.

355
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,820
Give yourself

356
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,880
freely.

357
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,260
Give yourself

358
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,880
away

359
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,440
freely.

360
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,540
Your heart,

361
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,360
your body,

362
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,460
your labor,

363
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,000
your presence,

364
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,020
your love,

365
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,140
your ear,

366
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,820
whatever

367
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
is needed.

368
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,800
And if you

369
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,300

397
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:29,640
I didn't

398
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:29,840

399
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,520

I was

404
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,840
busily making

405
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,660

406
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,360
lost track of

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,740

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:39,760
Any questions?

412
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,660

413
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,420
Oh.

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,820

mean to

437
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:08,980
you?

438
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,760
When you

439
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:10,980
say,

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,200
or is it

441
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,540
just

442
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,260
dana dinner?

443
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:13,600
So,

444
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,060
I need to

445
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,400
know what

446
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,820
you mean

447
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,480

448
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,080
dana dinner.

449
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,460
I mean,

450
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,080
is it just

451
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,660
like that?

452
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,460
Is it just

453
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:20,900
a thing

454
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,320
that's

455
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,960
actually,

456
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,700
I mean,

457
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,120
what I've

458
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
been saying,

459
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,080
and let me

460
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,740
say it again

461
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,380
in a little

462
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,000
bit of a

463
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
different way,

464
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,320
what it

465
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,340
is for us

466
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,620
as Buddhists

467
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,540
here is

468
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,460
a way to

469
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,080
learn for

470
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,820
ourselves

471
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,380
what the

472
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,020
Buddha was

473
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,900
talking about,

474
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,660
what the

475
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,000
Buddha's

476
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,460
teachings

477
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,500
meant when

478
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,940
they talked

479
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,280
about

480
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,680
dana,

481
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,480
that dana

482
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
is an

483
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,300
act of

484
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,520
giving and

485
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,020
receiving at

486
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,400
the same

487
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,840
time.

488
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,580
It's like

489
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,000
when you

490
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,340
stub your

491
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,720
toe,

492
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,480
it needs

493
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:11,860
help,

494
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,340
and you

495
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,940
immediately

496
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,780
give,

497
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,800
you grab

498
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,320
your foot

499
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,760
and you

500
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,280
hop around

501
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,660
saying,

502
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:17,940
ooh,

503
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,380
ooh,

504
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,800
ooh,

505
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,440
and then

506
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,260
you receive,

507
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,960
you start

508
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,600
feeling better.

509
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
You

510
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,440
give the

511
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,980
nourishment,

512
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:28,360
you know,

513
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,860
you stroke

514
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,260
yourself,

515
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,460
and you

516
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,300
receive it

517
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,480
simultaneously.

518
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,000
so that's

519
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,720
what giving

520
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,520
and receiving

521
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
dana means

522
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,320
to a

523
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,660
Buddhist.

524
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,360
And

525
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,880
what we

526
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,460
want to

527
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,740
learn this

528
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,140
weekend

529
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,860
is how in

530
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,700
this process

531
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,100
of getting

532
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,720
together with

533
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,100
all these

534
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,500
people

535
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,740
to make

536
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,320
that work.

537
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,520
And if we

538
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,100
can make it

539
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,780
work here,

540
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,400
you know,

541
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,120
being very

542
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,200
aware of it

543
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,720
and conscious

544
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,200
of it,

545
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,100
maybe then

546
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,400
we can

547
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,700
make it

548
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,040
work in

549
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,480
the world.

550
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,720
So it's

551
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,100
not the

552
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,520
same as

553
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,440
walking along

554
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,840
and there's

555
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,360
some poor

556
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,920
guy on the

557
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,260
side of the

558
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,700
road that

559
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:07,980
says,

560
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,240
do you

561
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,620
have a

562
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,860
quarter for

563
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,280
a cup of

564
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,640
coffee?

565
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:10,920
And you

566
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,100
say,

567
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,460
sure,

568
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:11,840
here.

569
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,100
And they

570
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,280
say,

571
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,440
oh,

572
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:13,840
thank you

573
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,320
very much.

574
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,540
You say,

575
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,000
it's okay.

576
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,020
And they

577
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,400
go have a

578
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,680
cup of

579
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,040
coffee.

580
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,840
That's

581
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,420
charity.

582
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,380
So it's

583
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,140
not charity.

584
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,420
You know,

585
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,900
it's not

586
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,360
being a

587
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,060
benefactor.

588
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,920
It's not

589
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,280
making

590
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,880
yourself

591
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,560
higher,

592
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,180
bigger,

593
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,640
or more

594
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,000
important.

595
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,220
See,

596
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,500
when you

597
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,260
help somebody,

598
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,280
usually that

599
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,040
person is

600
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,800
down and

601
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,100
out and

602
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,300
you're

603
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,800
bigger and

604
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,240
stronger.

605
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
Donna makes

606
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,080
you the

607
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,960
same and

608
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,400
then completely

609
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,120
merged into

610
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,620
one thing.

611
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,760
So there's

612
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,340
only Peter

613
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,420
in the whole

614
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,940
universe.

615
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
He's swallowed

616
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,680
up everything.

617
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,680
Okay?

618
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,280
Anyone else?

619
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,760
Why do we do

620
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,260
it at Christmas?

621
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,600
We're actually,

622
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,380
I mean,

623
00:23:59,460 --> 00:23:59,800
Christmas,

624
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,340
that holiday

625
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,480
time is,

626
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,860
I mean,

627
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,700
so obviously

628
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,040
universal.

629
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,360
You know,

630
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
they even make

631
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,820
a big deal

632
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,220
out of it in

633
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,040
Japan now.

634
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,220
And as time

635
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,960
goes on and

636
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,480
the earth

637
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
gets smaller,

638
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,840
all the

639
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,440
countries are

640
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,840
doing it,

641
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,580
even without

642
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,120
any relationship

643
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,020
to Christmas.

644
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,840
what they've

645
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
imported is

646
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,840
the worst

647
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,720
of what

648
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,280
the whole

649
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,680
thing is

650
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,980
about.

651
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,220
I mean,

652
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,640
the whole

653
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,920
concept of

654
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,620
Christ and

655
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,160
Christianity,

656
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,220
and it's the

657
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,060
Catholic Church's

658
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,640
fault for

659
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,140
doing that.

660
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,700
Christ wasn't

661
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,180
born in

662
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,540
December.

663
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,980
He was born

664
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,660
in March.

665
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:40,960
He's a

666
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,540
Pisces.

667
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,240
I have it

668
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,460
from,

669
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,520
yeah,

670
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,720
yeah,

671
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,240
he was.

672
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,300
I knew he

673
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,700
wasn't a

674
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,140
Capricorn.

675
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,480
Right.

676
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:52,880
Right.

677
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,760
I mean,

678
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,260
most of the,

679
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,500
I mean,

680
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,100
Buddha was a

681
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,940
Pisces too.

682
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,500
Gurjeev,

683
00:24:59,580 --> 00:24:59,840
I mean,

684
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,200
a lot of

685
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,540
people,

686
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,000
spiritual

687
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,500
people.

688
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,440
so what's

689
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,320
happened is

690
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,240
what happened

691
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,760
is that

692
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,620
the Druids

693
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,320
had this

694
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
pagan holiday

695
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,160
which all

696
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,680
the things

697
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,540
that we

698
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,300
call Christmas

699
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,840
that people

700
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,480
know as

701
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,040
Christmas,

702
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,640
giving of

703
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,260
gifts,

704
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,400
the mistletoe,

705
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,840
the office

706
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,540
party,

707
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,780
getting

708
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,600
drunk,

709
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,140
all those

710
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,580
things were

711
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,080
part of

712
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,520
that

713
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,800
feast

714
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,820
of the

715
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,280
Druids

716
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,580
and people

717
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,280
continued to

718
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,700
do it

719
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,840
and so

720
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,620
the Catholic

721
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,760
Church

722
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,060
moved the

723
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,460
holiday

724
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,900
to that

725
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,420
time

726
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,860
hoping to

727
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,960
overcome it

728
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,380
with the

729
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,020
force of

730
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,580
the birth of

731
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,260
Christ and so

732
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,720
on but what

733
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,340
happened is

734
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,140
they merged

735
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,840
and became

736
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,460
a kind of

737
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,760
a mixture

738
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,180
of both.

739
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,620
Same thing

740
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,380
with Halloween.

741
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,680
Halloween,

742
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,520
I was reading

743
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,020
a thing,

744
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,520
I don't know

745
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,120
how true it

746
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,280
is,

747
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,240
it was put

748
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,020
out by the

749
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,740
born again

750
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,320
Christians,

751
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,640
how evil

752
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,720
Halloween is

753
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,060
and that

754
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,820
it's really

755
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,880
devil worshippers

756
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,640
and so on

757
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,400
and they

758
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,860
traced the

759
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,440
holiday back

760
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,160
also to a

761
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,900
Druid thing

762
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,320
and it had

763
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,020
to do with

764
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,700
the rising

765
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,500
of the dead

766
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:15,940
and the

767
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,980
worship of

768
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,940
demons

769
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,600
and stuff

770
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,220
like that

771
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,720
and there

772
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,080
was a lot

773
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,720
more to it

774
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,580
and they

775
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,740
made that

776
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,620
Hallow Eve

777
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,420
All Saints

778
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,740
Day

779
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,780
and that

780
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,120
too

781
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
ended up

782
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,980
kind of

783
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,420
a merge

784
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:31,980
thing.

785
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,680
So what

786
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,600
I'd like to

787
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,320
see us do

788
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,740
with that

789
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,340
same thing

790
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:36,800
and actually

791
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,480
we do this

792
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,160
close to the

793
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,660
solstice,

794
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,040
the winter

795
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,600
solstice,

796
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,820
I mean clearly

797
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,240
the winter

798
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,160
solstice is a

799
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,580
time for

800
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,200
celebration.

801
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,420
All cultures

802
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,600
celebrate the

803
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,240
various solstice

804
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,480
holidays and

805
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,100
equinoxes

806
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,320
because there

807
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,000
are times of

808
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,500
transition

809
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,140
and here

810
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,060
the solstice,

811
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,860
the days will

812
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,460
begin to get

813
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,060
longer and

814
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,700
the approach

815
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,300
of spring

816
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,240
is a cause

817
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,000
for celebration

818
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,960
and my

819
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,780
problem with

820
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,020
it is that

821
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,220
it has become

822
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,140
so awful

823
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,500
to go down

824
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,180
to the mall

825
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,760
and to see

826
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,440
the looks on

827
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,340
people's faces

828
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,160
they're in pain

829
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,940
they're in agony

830
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,340
and then to see

831
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,040
what happens

832
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,800
with the gifts

833
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,180
it's a gesture

834
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,580
it's not really

835
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,500
even giving

836
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,320
not even in the

837
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,980
remotest thing

838
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,520
for the most

839
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:25,880
part

840
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,500
and I'd like

841
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,020
to see what

842
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,580
the garbage

843
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,600
dumps look like

844
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,260
a week after

845
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:31,840
Christmas

846
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
with all the

847
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,340
things that get

848
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,140
thrown away

849
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,460
and all the

850
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,200
waste that's

851
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,160
created because

852
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,540
of it

853
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,480
and we're just

854
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,060
as bad

855
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,660
I mean we're

856
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,480
not much

857
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,840
better

858
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,780
but I'm

859
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,040
hoping this

860
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,380
year is where

861
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,160
it really struck

862
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,380
me that we

863
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,360
need to do

864
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,760
something to

865
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,680
make it a

866
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,160
little bit

867
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
more in

868
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,240
line with

869
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,340
what our

870
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,980
understanding

871
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,040
of Dana

872
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,860
is

873
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,940
in the

874
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,580
same way

875
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,480
that you

876
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,780
know you

877
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,020
can't

878
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,160
you can't

879
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,660
beat

880
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,260
the forces

881
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,740
of the

882
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,280
universe

883
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,960
by just

884
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,740
opposing them

885
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,120
you can't

886
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,500
just throw

887
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,120
up a barrier

888
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,900
so for

889
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,360
example

890
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,220
the media

891
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,340
has done

892
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,000
some awful

893
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,520
stuff

894
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,860
I mean the

895
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,640
reason there

896
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,960
is home

897
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,440
video

898
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,600
and interactive

899
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,580
CD-ROM

900
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,180
is because

901
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,920
of pornography

902
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,340
that's what

903
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,900
if it wasn't

904
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,660
for pornography

905
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,360
those things

906
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,860
never would

907
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,120
have been

908
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,400
born

909
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
that's the

910
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,040
multi-billion

911
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,880
dollar industry

912
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,640
that's underneath

913
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:34,980
it

914
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,800
so what do

915
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,200
you do

916
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,680
you say

917
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,000
okay

918
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
we won't

919
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,980
use CD-ROMs

920
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,300
and we'll

921
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,760
never look

922
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,240
at a video

923
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,880
that's not

924
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,380
the answer

925
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,860
to it

926
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,500
the media

927
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,720
is neutral

928
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,920
it's the

929
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,560
artists and

930
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,900
the people

931
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,380
that put it

932
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,740
together

933
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,300
that make

934
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,140
it what

935
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,660
it is

936
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,540
you know

937
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,060
it's like

938
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,780
condemning

939
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,680
cotton

940
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,260
or

941
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,520
metal

942
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,700
because it's

943
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,240
made into

944
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,260
a gun

945
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,220
how can we

946
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,000
use these

947
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,940
things in

948
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,580
a way that

949
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,220
nourishes

950
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,820
rather than

951
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,280
poisons

952
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,140
photography

953
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,960
is a

954
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,280
wonderful

955
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,760
media

956
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
it poisons

957
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,040
but it also

958
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,600
nourishes

959
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,040
and it

960
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,420
heals

961
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,360
and it

962
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,820
depends on

963
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,200
how you

964
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,640
use it

965
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,340
so I

966
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:18,640
think it's

967
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,200
the same

968
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,660
with a lot

969
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,040
of things

970
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,360
in our

971
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:20,820
society

972
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,140
they're not

973
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,320
going to

974
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,780
go away

975
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,060
so how

976
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,440
can we

977
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
use them

978
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
to nourish

979
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,660
and that's

980
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,380
basically what

981
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,080
we're exploring

982
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,340
with this

983
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,780
holiday

984
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,060
everybody's

985
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,560
already into

986
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,060
the holiday

987
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,340
and they're

988
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:33,680
going to do

989
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,260
it one way

990
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,620
or another

991
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,360
and the

992
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,780
people that

993
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,300
can't do

994
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:36,560
it

995
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,840
because of

996
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,200
circumstances

997
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,080
because they

998
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,900
don't have

999
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,680
the luxury

1000
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,600
of choice

1001
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,240
like we

1002
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,660
have

1003
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,200
become

1004
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,000
despondent

1005
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,600
and disturbed

1006
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,160
by it

1007
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,180
by not

1008
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,900
having that

1009
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,960
so this is

1010
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,580
an opportunity

1011
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,220
to do

1012
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,920
something there

1013
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,460
but to do

1014
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
something in a

1015
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,840
nourishing way

1016
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,480
more positive

1017
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:58,680
way

1018
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:06,560
I think you

1019
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,840
do

1020
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,800
I've told

1021
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,480
a lot of

1022
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,040
my students

1023
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,520
here the

1024
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:09,980
story of

1025
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,300
when I

1026
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,140
first started

1027
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,020
teaching

1028
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,040
it was very

1029
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,780
difficult for

1030
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,540
me to have

1031
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,360
what's called

1032
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,860
an anja

1033
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,940
an attendant

1034
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,440
that takes

1035
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,160
care of

1036
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,900
the teacher

1037
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,240
the reason

1038
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,500
it was

1039
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,180
difficult for

1040
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,880
me is that

1041
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,180
my father

1042
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,720
died when I

1043
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,040
was very

1044
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,380
young

1045
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,060
and we

1046
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,660
were pretty

1047
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,140
well all

1048
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,580
family

1049
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,860
and he

1050
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,400
was a

1051
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,920
politician

1052
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,260
at the

1053
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,940
state level

1054
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,660
and my

1055
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,520
mother was

1056
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,080
you know

1057
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,900
hostess to

1058
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,240
all these

1059
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,900
important people

1060
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,260
and everything

1061
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,640
and then he

1062
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,040
died

1063
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,840
didn't believe

1064
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,420
in insurance

1065
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,860
you know

1066
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,340
this was

1067
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,380
1939

1068
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,480
and so he

1069
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,020
left us

1070
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,520
basically

1071
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,220
penniless

1072
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,320
my mother

1073
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,840
had to go

1074
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,420
to work

1075
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,020
but she

1076
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,500
really didn't

1077
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,900
have any

1078
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,260
skills

1079
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,780
women in

1080
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,180
those days

1081
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,660
didn't

1082
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,620
and so

1083
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,060
she went

1084
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,700
to school

1085
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,740
and worked

1086
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,140
and was

1087
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,040
cleaning house

1088
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,200
and avoiding

1089
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,980
I mean she

1090
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,500
was just too

1091
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,020
proud to

1092
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,480
take what

1093
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,900
was called

1094
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,340
relief

1095
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,860
same as

1096
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,280
welfare

1097
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,660
now she

1098
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,040
would never

1099
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,580
take it

1100
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,840
but I

1101
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,240
would find

1102
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,760
her crying

1103
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,660
at night

1104
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,280
because she

1105
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,660
was cleaning

1106
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,680
houses for

1107
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,160
the people

1108
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,600
that she

1109
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,940
was the

1110
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,820
hostess for

1111
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,100
years before

1112
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,800
you know

1113
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,920
she was a

1114
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,420
housekeeper

1115
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,260
and it

1116
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,960
really bothered

1117
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,160
me that

1118
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,740
I mean it

1119
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,580
imprinted me

1120
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,180
pretty deeply

1121
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,660
I was nine

1122
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,180
years old

1123
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,160
later when I

1124
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,680
got married

1125
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,260
and was

1126
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,420
making a

1127
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:34,980
lot of

1128
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,260
money

1129
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,140
my wife

1130
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,560
wanted a

1131
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,060
housekeeper

1132
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,320
and somebody

1133
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,740
would come in

1134
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,040
and actually

1135
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,780
even cook for

1136
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,560
us and I

1137
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,320
kept resisting

1138
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,980
it and then

1139
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,000
finally I

1140
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,440
agreed to

1141
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,860
do it

1142
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,700
and we'd

1143
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,060
have this

1144
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,860
woman come

1145
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,000
in who

1146
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,520
cleaned the

1147
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,100
house and

1148
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,760
would feed

1149
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,200
the kids

1150
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,540
and then

1151
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,220
serve us

1152
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,600
in another

1153
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,020
room I

1154
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,660
felt so

1155
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,360
awful you

1156
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,500
know I

1157
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:56,900
kept thinking

1158
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,200
of my

1159
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,180
mother just

1160
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,680
couldn't do

1161
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,160
it you know

1162
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,380
and so we

1163
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,140
finally stopped

1164
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,960
that big

1165
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,800
arguments over

1166
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,240
it so years

1167
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,720
later I

1168
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,160
become a

1169
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,200
teacher and

1170
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,700
part of being

1171
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,600
a teacher is

1172
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,320
you have a

1173
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,100
group of

1174
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,040
attendants a

1175
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,620
personal

1176
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,340
attendant a

1177
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,780
secretary a

1178
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,960
housekeeper and

1179
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
all that but

1180
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,460
I wasn't going to

1181
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,900
do that

1182
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,840
and so one

1183
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,640
day my

1184
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,180
teacher was

1185
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,880
visiting me

1186
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,480
and we're

1187
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,740
at the

1188
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,060
house and

1189
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm running

1190
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
around serving

1191
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,240
him cooking

1192
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,780
getting his

1193
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,180
ready he

1194
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,880

Anja I'm a

1211
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,400
regular guy he

1212
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,940
said how can

1213
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,440
you be so

1214
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,040
selfish

1215
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,160
I said why

1216
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,400
he said what

1217
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:52,780
do you mean

1218
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,980
he said how

1219
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,580
can you be so

1220
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,560
selfish and not

1221
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,340
allow your

1222
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,200
students to

1223
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,900
serve you to

1224
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,440
give back to

1225
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,340
you what you

1226
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,000
give to them

1227
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,680
and it changed

1228
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,340
my whole notion

1229
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:06,980
about that

1230
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,860
and I suddenly

1231
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,580
started doing

1232
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,220
it I'm still

1233
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
uncomfortable with

1234
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,900
it but I

1235
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,460
feel it's an

1236
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,420
important part of

1237
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
the whole process

1238
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,060
that they need

1239
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,920
to otherwise

1240
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,560
they become

1241
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,940
thieves they

1242
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,720
take and

1243
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,040
don't give

1244
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,320
and they

1245
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,920
feel awful

1246
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,540
about it

1247
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,580
they want

1248
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:23,800
to

1249
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,680
students want

1250
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,740
to give

1251
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,200
back

1252
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,220
I know I

1253
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,700
did when I

1254
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,100
was serving

1255
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,520
my teacher

1256
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,260
I felt great

1257
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,280
but we used

1258
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,740
to fight

1259
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,300
over who

1260
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,640
could do

1261
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,340
it

1262
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,560
what about

1263
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:33,580
what about

1264
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:33,900
if you're

1265
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,360
on the end

1266
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,900
of wanting

1267
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,720
to give

1268
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,200
back

1269
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,860
say that

1270
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,060
again

1271
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,880
are you

1272
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,520
stuck

1273
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,340
not

1274
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,200
having

1275
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,760
Donna

1276
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,140
if the

1277
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,760
other person

1278
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,720
doesn't give

1279
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,080
back

1280
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,760
or is there

1281
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,040
something

1282
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,140
that you

1283
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,460
can

1284
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:48,960
oh no

1285
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,940
they don't

1286
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,800
it's not

1287
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,940
there's no

1288
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,960
conscious giving

1289
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,800
on their part

1290
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,160
there's no

1291
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,360
conscious

1292
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,000
I mean

1293
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
Lenny

1294
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,480
mentioned

1295
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,260
last night

1296
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,660
when we were

1297
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,260
at the prison

1298
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,160
and I

1299
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,880
mentioned it

1300
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,340
before

1301
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,260
every time

1302
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,620
we go to

1303
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,120
the prison

1304
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,260
to work

1305
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,500
with the

1306
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,820
prisoners

1307
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,220
you know

1308
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,120
we're like

1309
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,620
the heroes

1310
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,180
we come in

1311
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,500
from the

1312
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,860
outside

1313
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,800
and we're

1314
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,660
doing something

1315
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,080
for them

1316
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,520
we're bringing

1317
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,060
the Dharma

1318
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,520
to them

1319
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:12,940
and everything

1320
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,200
and by the

1321
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,660
time we're

1322
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,020
finished

1323
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,760
we're all

1324
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,520
walking away

1325
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:16,920
with our

1326
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,580
tails between

1327
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:17,960
our legs

1328
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,520
because we've

1329
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,420
received so much

1330
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,640
it seems so

1331
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,380
lopsided

1332
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,740
you know

1333
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,940
and it's not

1334
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,060
it's not

1335
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,860
that physically

1336
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,160
they're saying

1337
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,500
okay

1338
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,200
you gave me

1339
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,580
this now

1340
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm going

1341
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,040
to give

1342
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,460
you this

1343
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,940
it's just

1344
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,380
that it

1345
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:31,860
happens

1346
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,380
by the

1347
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
it's like

1348
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,040
making love

1349
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,280
you know

1350
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,720
nobody's

1351
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,240
thinking about

1352
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,660
okay you

00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,140

1355
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:37,960
kiss you

1356
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,320

you know

1361
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,660
you just

1362
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,460
do it

1363
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,840
the birds

1364
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,640
do it

1365
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,100
and the bees

1366
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,740
do it

1367
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,460
anybody else

1368
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,480

the way you

1371
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,220
practice

1372
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,520
you know

1373
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,120
your breath

1374
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,060
so it

1375
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,740
comes up

1376
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,620

to the

1386
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,540
moment

1387
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,380
I mean

1388
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,060
it's

1389
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,220
it's

1390
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,900
when I

1391
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,100
say

1392
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,820
nourishment

1393
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,860
to be

1394
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,520
nourished

1395
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,020
it's kind

1396
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,460
of a

1397
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,080
vague

1398
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,300
intangible

1399
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,700
term

1400
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,840
but I've

1401
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,860
talked about

1402
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,540
nourishment

1403
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,420
in terms

1404
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,160
of photography

1405
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,900
for example

1406
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,520
or in

1407
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:31,900
terms of

1408
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,200
art

1409
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,840
or music

1410
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,900
there is

1411
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,420
art

1412
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,460
that poisons

1413
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,300
and there's

1414
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,820
art that

1415
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,460
nourishes

1416
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,420
art that

1417
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,020
poisons

1418
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,660
is art

1419
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,120
that when

1420
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,360
you've

1421
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,000
experienced

1422
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,200
it

1423
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,700
a photograph

1424
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,540
a painting

1425
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,080
piece of

1426
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,540
music

1427
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,160
and then

1428
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,720
walk away

1429
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,100
from it

1430
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,720
you feel

1431
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,160
as if

1432
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,400
you've

1433
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,620
lost

1434
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,080
something

1435
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,100
something

1436
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,440
has

1437
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,460
been taken

1438
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:57,940
away

1439
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,000
art that

1440
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,520
nourishes

1441
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,800
when you

1442
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,300
walk away

1443
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:02,840
from it

1444
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,940
you feel

1445
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,600
that you've

1446
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,140
received

1447
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,640
something

1448
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,740
you feel

1449
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,420
nicer

1450
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,000
better

1451
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,480
greater

1452
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,520
so

1453
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,180
nourishment

1454
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,660
is what

1455
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,000
I hope

1456
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,580
spiritual

1457
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,220
nourishment

1458
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,900
to take

1459
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,220
away

1460
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,820
as well

1461
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,640
as some

1462
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,060
pretty good

1463
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,460
food

1464
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,800
I mean

1465
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,380
those turkeys

1466
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,200
are nothing

1467
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,000
to scoff

1468
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,320
at

1469
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,340
you're the

1470
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:27,780
last one

1471
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,000
Peter

1472
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,540
you started

1473
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:28,980
and you're

1474
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,120
going to

1475
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,520
close it

1476
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,960
go ahead

1477
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,380
say that

1478
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,300
last line

1479
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,580
again

1480
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,640
you gave

1481
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,180
thanks to

1482
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,460
her

1483
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,680
what doesn't

1484
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,040
make any

1485
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,440
well the

1486
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,960
best one

1487
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,400
to talk

1488
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,900
to about

1489
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,380
that I

1490
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,100
guess is

1491
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,800
guess who

1492
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,120
I mean I'm

1493
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,940
a father

1494
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,920
and I

1495
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,680
feel good

1496
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,000
when my

1497
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,480
kids feel

1498
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:00,820
good

1499
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,220
so whenever

1500
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,720
I can do

1501
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,260
something to

1502
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,200
help my

1503
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,640
kids

1504
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
I mean

1505
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,940
they're all

1506
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,900
you would

1507
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,220
think they

1508
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,640
were old

1509
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,100
people

1510
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,940
now

1511
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,400
you know

1512
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,820
they're like

1513
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,400
38

1514
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,380
39 years

1515
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,720
old

1516
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
but even

1517
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,020
now I

1518
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,320
mean I

1519
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,860
when I

1520
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,320
see that

1521
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,600
they're

1522
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,000
happy

1523
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,740
I'm

1524
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,080

1525
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,560
my mother

1526
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:19,920

1527
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,280
say that

1528
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,680

you know

1530
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,540
when I

1531
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,820
would do

1532
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,140
all the

1533
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,860

1534
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,480

1535
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,900

it all

1568
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,120

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,940
age

1602
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,560
is the one

1603
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,820
that

1604
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,000
technically

1605
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,720
I am

1606
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,360
that

1607
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,920
is

1608
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,420
I'm a

1609
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,940
Pisces

1610
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,800
I was born

1611
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,260
in February

1612
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,240
26

1613
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,880
1930

1614
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,400
but my

1615
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,040
real age

1616
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm a

1617
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:28,840
Gemini

1618
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,200
and I

1619
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,600
was born

1620
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,560
in 1931

1621
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,380
so

1622
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
I have

1623
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,020
two ages

1624
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,820
I think

1625
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,160
so

1626
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,560
as far

1627
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:40,860
as I'm

1628
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,240
concerned

1629
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,700
they weren't

1630
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,800
thank you

1631
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,260
everybody
