WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.500
Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will take place tomorrow.

00:16.320 --> 00:25.000
And our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county.

00:25.000 --> 00:38.900
And I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is.

00:41.880 --> 00:50.280
We translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all.

00:50.280 --> 01:06.160
And we have that problem with the English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.600
And as a result, they become misinterpreted.

01:10.600 --> 01:16.340
And that's why many of them we retain in the original form, such as Donna.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.560
Donna is one of the paramitas.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.280
There are six paramitas.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.820
And these paramitas have been in existence a long time.

01:29.920 --> 01:33.060
They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of.

01:33.060 --> 01:37.780
And Donna is the first of those.

01:38.240 --> 01:44.720
And each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you somehow miss what they're about.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.900
For example, we translate Prajna paramita.

01:49.060 --> 01:53.460
Paramita literally means other shore or to cross over.

01:53.460 --> 02:09.680
And our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.440
Prajna, we translate as wisdom.

02:14.440 --> 02:20.780
And wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about accumulating knowledge.

02:21.660 --> 02:23.780
It's not what Prajna means.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.460
It has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it have anything to do with knowing.

02:31.820 --> 02:35.540
So that the calling it wisdom misses it.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.660
The same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion.

02:39.660 --> 02:47.360
Compassion has a sense of empathy about it, which implies self and other.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.760
In compassion, there is no dualism.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.420
There is no self or other.

02:52.580 --> 02:57.140
And we translate dana as giving.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.880
And that, too, misses the point.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.060
Because giving is not dana.

03:03.940 --> 03:05.880
Not quite dana.

03:09.660 --> 03:20.220
There can be no dana, unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.

03:21.420 --> 03:25.940
So that the giver and the receiver are unified.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.080
They become one thing.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.460
It's the same with compassion.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.560
There's no doer or the thing that you're doing to.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.580
There's no effort or even sense of it occurring.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.860
Compassion happens the way your hair grows.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.340
It's spontaneous.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.660
There's no knowledge of it.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.320
So dana is not charity.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.700
And it's not generosity.

03:48.700 --> 03:54.640
And it's not almsgiving or donation or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction.

03:55.460 --> 03:59.520
It's not contribution or gift or philanthropy or offering.

03:59.520 --> 04:07.280
But rather, it's the practice of total, unequivocal relinquishment.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.480
What is relinquishment?

04:11.660 --> 04:12.440
What does that mean?

04:13.320 --> 04:23.880
The great master, Hui Hai, who was a successor of Basso, talked about it in a dialogue with one of his monks.

04:23.880 --> 04:30.180
The monk asked, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?

04:31.640 --> 04:34.060
The master said, by means of dana paramita.

04:35.700 --> 04:39.420
According to the Buddha and the Bodhisattva path, the monk said,

04:40.460 --> 04:43.920
the Bodhisattva path consists of six paramitas.

04:44.060 --> 04:45.680
Why then have you mentioned only one?

04:45.680 --> 04:52.760
Please explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter.

04:54.440 --> 05:00.980
The master said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from dana paramita

05:00.980 --> 05:06.540
and that it's by practice, by its practice, that all others are fulfilled.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.920
Why it's the first one of the paramitas.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.940
Why is it called dana paramita?

05:15.820 --> 05:18.260
The answer, dana means relinquishment.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.440
Question, relinquishment of what?

05:22.220 --> 05:25.640
Answer, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.120
What does that mean?

05:27.500 --> 05:28.280
The monk asked.

05:29.160 --> 05:34.500
It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,

05:35.060 --> 05:38.660
being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,

05:38.660 --> 05:42.020
concentration and distraction, pure and impure.

05:42.580 --> 05:49.040
By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

05:49.780 --> 05:56.120
The real practice of dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of,

05:56.680 --> 06:02.780
now I see that opposites are void, or now I have relinquished all of them.

06:02.780 --> 06:09.240
We may also call it the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of current cause.

06:10.140 --> 06:15.180
For it is when these are cut off that the whole dharma nature becomes void, empty.

06:15.740 --> 06:22.060
And this emptiness of the dharma nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever.

06:22.700 --> 06:27.080
Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned.

06:27.080 --> 06:27.440
Why?

06:27.440 --> 06:35.520
Because our self-nature is non-existent and does not contain a single thing foreign to itself.

06:36.400 --> 06:43.840
That which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.520
It's said in the Diamond Sutra,

06:46.680 --> 06:51.120
those who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas, or enlightened ones.

06:51.120 --> 06:59.420
So basically what he's saying is that dana is about forgetting the self.

07:00.380 --> 07:04.380
When there's no self, there's no other.

07:05.240 --> 07:09.980
This is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected,

07:10.640 --> 07:12.700
where all things are codependent,

07:13.620 --> 07:17.800
where all things nourish each other and themselves.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.460
Who forget the self is body and mind fallen away.

07:24.480 --> 07:30.280
In our practice, giving and receiving is at the heart of almost everything that we do.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.500
That's what our service is about.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.380
Our liturgy is about.

07:38.120 --> 07:43.380
We receive the teachings and we return gratitude.

07:43.380 --> 07:50.980
We receive food and we acknowledge.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.220
Therefore, we eat this food with everyone.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.440
We eat to stop all evil, to practice good.

08:02.020 --> 08:03.240
What's the next line?

08:04.220 --> 08:08.340
Save all sentient beings and to accomplish the Buddha way.

08:08.340 --> 08:17.600
So the receiving of the food, it's taken with the intent of giving, to follow it.

08:17.820 --> 08:20.060
We receive the teachings and we give.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.040
We return it.

08:22.060 --> 08:26.740
So giving and receiving, the heart of that in Japanese Buddhism,

08:27.200 --> 08:29.380
they have the practice of takahatsu.

08:29.380 --> 08:35.500
And there they try to recreate that practice of giving and receiving,

08:36.020 --> 08:43.440
where the monk begs for food and receives food

08:43.440 --> 08:48.640
and then gives a chance something for the person that's given them the food.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.800
And it's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified.

08:52.800 --> 09:04.600
So the giving and receiving is constantly a manifestation of the interrelatedness,

09:04.720 --> 09:09.840
codependency, mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra,

09:10.060 --> 09:16.420
in which all things, every speck of dust in this vast universe is interrelated,

09:17.120 --> 09:20.180
is codependent, has a mutual causality.

09:20.180 --> 09:23.960
What happens to one thing happens to the totality of it.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.440
Past, present, future.

09:26.960 --> 09:33.980
That diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space

09:33.980 --> 09:36.560
as well as the fourth dimension of time.

09:39.420 --> 09:44.860
It's because that there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously

09:44.860 --> 09:46.540
that it's never exhausted.

09:46.540 --> 09:50.800
When it's really happening that way, it's never exhausted.

09:52.300 --> 10:01.800
And that's why I've always felt that it's essential to people in the helping professions

10:01.800 --> 10:04.920
to really understand what they're doing.

10:04.920 --> 10:12.600
If they're not receiving while they're giving,

10:13.600 --> 10:17.480
if they're doing something for somebody else,

10:17.580 --> 10:20.840
if they're helping somebody else or saving somebody else,

10:20.880 --> 10:22.180
it's all going in one direction.

10:23.260 --> 10:27.760
If they have not yet understood that they are receiving,

10:27.900 --> 10:32.100
that there's a possibility to be received, to receive something.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.200
There is a mutual nourishment.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.280
There is a mutual healing.

10:36.720 --> 10:41.800
Healer and the healed are both healed in the process.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.700
And when you understand that, you don't exhaust anything.

10:46.660 --> 10:50.300
It's endless, boundless.

10:50.300 --> 11:01.760
When I think back at the teachers that I've known in my time of practice,

11:01.760 --> 11:02.680
I've seen that.

11:03.220 --> 11:06.980
The real teachers have boundless energy, people say.

11:07.780 --> 11:09.120
You know, what's the reservoir?

11:09.340 --> 11:10.180
Where does it come from?

11:10.240 --> 11:11.340
What do they plug into?

11:11.800 --> 11:15.640
Well, they're plugged into the center of the universe itself.

11:15.640 --> 11:21.320
That's where the nourishment comes from.

11:21.820 --> 11:24.920
It's by the giving and receiving happening simultaneously.

11:25.160 --> 11:30.260
Asatani Roshi was 88 years old or 89 years old.

11:30.380 --> 11:31.400
Very, very sick.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.400
Close to the end of his life.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.380
Gaunt, weak, trembling.

11:37.380 --> 11:43.320
He had to be helped by two Jesus to go to this Jukai ceremony.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.500
The last Jukai ceremony that he did the day before he died.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.120
And he couldn't even do his bows.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.940
They helped him to his seat.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.460
His voice was very weak as he introduced the whole thing.

11:59.460 --> 12:03.860
And he offered the incense and began the ceremony.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.520
And a lion appeared.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.360
His voice became strong.

12:10.640 --> 12:16.080
The power of his presence enveloped the entire group of people.

12:17.040 --> 12:23.120
He completed the Jukai ceremony as if he were 30 years old instead of 88 years old.

12:23.120 --> 12:29.460
And then relapsed into his being very weak and helped out of the place and everything.

12:31.020 --> 12:36.400
That Jukai ceremony was filling him with energy.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.520
What he was giving, he was receiving.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.400
The next day, he never got out of bed.

12:45.400 --> 12:52.280
He asked his attendant at one point while she was preparing breakfast to sit him up in bed

12:52.280 --> 12:54.680
so he could sit in a Zazen posture.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.880
When she came back, she found him dead.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.660
Where did that energy come from?

13:01.520 --> 13:04.160
It came from the very process of dhana.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.920
And all of what we do is dhana.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.960
Dogen says,

13:15.760 --> 13:20.140
The self gives the self for the sake of giving the self.

13:20.140 --> 13:24.880
The other gives the other for the sake of giving the other.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.660
Giving is purposeless.

13:29.140 --> 13:35.780
The karmic force of such giving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world.

13:35.780 --> 13:50.740
So it's not dhana unless it's non-dual, no separation.

13:51.700 --> 13:57.760
Dogen talks about dhana in terms of loving words,

13:58.480 --> 14:00.680
working for the welfare of all beings,

14:00.680 --> 14:03.460
and identity with others.

14:04.420 --> 14:09.800
And his words are the best way of expressing them.

14:09.860 --> 14:10.120
He says,

14:10.180 --> 14:13.680
Loving speech means that as you meet sentient beings,

14:14.840 --> 14:17.860
you first arouse a sense of compassion in your mind

14:17.860 --> 14:21.340
and treat them with considerate and affectionate words.

14:22.020 --> 14:22.960
Praise the virtuous.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.040
Have compassion on the wicked.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.920
As you take delight in affectionate words,

14:29.020 --> 14:30.620
they will gradually flourish,

14:31.480 --> 14:34.580
and then even those loving words,

14:34.680 --> 14:37.840
which were hitherto unknown and unperceived,

14:38.360 --> 14:40.080
will begin to reveal themselves.

14:42.060 --> 14:42.880
Then he says,

14:42.980 --> 14:45.480
in terms of working for the welfare of all beings,

14:45.600 --> 14:45.880
he said,

14:45.960 --> 14:47.560
Working for the welfare of all beings

14:47.560 --> 14:50.040
means that you contrive ways to benefit

14:50.040 --> 14:52.480
all sentient beings, high and low.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.460
The practice of benefiting others is the total truth.

14:57.340 --> 15:00.200
Hence, it serves both self and other far and wide.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.520
Therefore, serve enemies and friends equally

15:03.520 --> 15:06.820
and assist self and other without discrimination.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.360
If you grasp this truth,

15:09.440 --> 15:12.080
you will see that this is the reason

15:12.080 --> 15:16.380
that even grass and trees,

15:16.900 --> 15:18.080
the wind and water,

15:18.080 --> 15:20.680
are all naturally engaged in the activity

15:20.680 --> 15:22.480
of benefiting others.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.580
And your understanding will certainly serve

15:26.580 --> 15:28.040
others' benefit.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.920
And then he says,

15:32.160 --> 15:33.360
Identity with others.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.180
Identity with others is non-differentiation,

15:37.880 --> 15:38.660
non-duality.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.160
This applies equally to the self and to others.

15:42.160 --> 15:46.060
There is a truth that after the self

15:46.060 --> 15:48.320
assimilates the other to itself,

15:48.900 --> 15:51.660
the self lets itself be assimilated to the other.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.740
This relationship of self and other

15:54.740 --> 15:57.660
is infinitely varied according to the circumstances.

15:57.660 --> 16:07.360
So, what Dogen's talking about,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.940
what dana is directing itself to,

16:12.620 --> 16:14.460
is the heart of being,

16:15.640 --> 16:18.160
the vast net of existence

16:18.160 --> 16:20.420
that we call the diamond net,

16:20.420 --> 16:25.360
the virtue of and harmony

16:25.360 --> 16:27.500
of the universe itself.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.100
This is the nature

16:31.100 --> 16:33.680
of all beings,

16:33.800 --> 16:35.220
of all sentient beings.

16:35.900 --> 16:36.600
It's there.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.800
Each one of us has that

16:39.800 --> 16:42.240
ability, that potential.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.500
but somehow

16:44.500 --> 16:47.120
we cover it.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.040
We cover it by our conditioning.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.820
We cover it by our ideas

16:53.820 --> 16:54.800
and notions.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.080
By our sense,

16:57.840 --> 16:59.360
the illusion of separateness.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.060
There are many ways

17:04.060 --> 17:05.080
to get to that.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.140
And of course,

17:06.280 --> 17:06.840
the heart of

17:06.840 --> 17:08.900
and most important way

17:08.900 --> 17:10.160
to get there is Zazen.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.600
Zazen just peels back

17:11.600 --> 17:12.980
the layers of those conditioning.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.160
That conditioning

17:14.160 --> 17:15.100
and underneath it

17:15.100 --> 17:16.480
in that ground of being

17:16.480 --> 17:17.000
is

17:17.000 --> 17:19.700
the perfection of giving.

17:20.780 --> 17:21.780
It's part of

17:21.780 --> 17:23.740
our human characteristic.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.380
It's part of

17:25.380 --> 17:25.960
what it means

17:25.960 --> 17:26.780
to be human.

17:27.140 --> 17:28.000
It's part of

17:28.000 --> 17:28.980
what it means

17:28.980 --> 17:31.400
to be alive.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.180
To be part of

17:34.180 --> 17:35.100
this great earth,

17:35.400 --> 17:36.040
all of it

17:36.040 --> 17:37.480
is constantly

17:37.480 --> 17:38.340
giving

17:38.340 --> 17:39.500
and receiving.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.060
Every aspect of it,

17:41.060 --> 17:41.660
every atom,

17:41.760 --> 17:42.560
every molecule.

17:45.060 --> 17:46.140
There would be

17:46.140 --> 17:47.200
no life

17:47.200 --> 17:47.900
if it weren't

17:47.900 --> 17:48.420
for that

17:48.420 --> 17:49.660
giving and receiving,

17:49.800 --> 17:50.920
that codependency.

17:51.080 --> 17:51.500
Even if you

17:51.500 --> 17:52.400
go down to

17:52.400 --> 17:53.380
a molecular

17:53.380 --> 17:54.540
or atomic level,

17:54.720 --> 17:55.520
the relationship

17:55.520 --> 17:57.360
between atoms

17:57.360 --> 17:58.500
that makes a molecule,

17:58.500 --> 17:59.700
that makes water,

18:00.500 --> 18:02.080
is giving

18:02.080 --> 18:02.760
and receiving.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.480
It shares

18:04.480 --> 18:05.260
the electrons.

18:05.400 --> 18:05.820
It shares

18:05.820 --> 18:06.440
the protons.

18:06.440 --> 18:07.580
It creates

18:07.580 --> 18:08.220
an entity

18:08.220 --> 18:09.480
by the act

18:09.480 --> 18:09.940
of giving

18:09.940 --> 18:10.620
and receiving.

18:10.820 --> 18:11.700
And so it is

18:11.700 --> 18:13.560
from the molecular

18:13.560 --> 18:14.580
atomic level

18:14.580 --> 18:15.160
to the most

18:15.160 --> 18:16.440
complex organisms,

18:16.620 --> 18:17.660
including the universe

18:17.660 --> 18:18.220
itself.

18:18.660 --> 18:19.900
How can we ignore it?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.260
How can we not

18:22.260 --> 18:22.440
understand

18:22.440 --> 18:24.280
that it's part

18:24.280 --> 18:25.900
of what it means

18:25.900 --> 18:27.080
to be in harmony

18:27.080 --> 18:27.760
with the nature

18:27.760 --> 18:28.540
of things?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.400
The spring breeze

18:31.400 --> 18:32.460
warms the earth

18:32.460 --> 18:33.420
and brings the rain.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.000
The earth offers up

18:36.000 --> 18:37.380
plants and vegetation.

18:39.060 --> 18:40.680
All of the earth's

18:40.680 --> 18:41.300
creatures

18:41.300 --> 18:42.620
breathe

18:42.620 --> 18:43.920
the sweet air

18:43.920 --> 18:44.600
that's produced

18:44.600 --> 18:45.180
by this,

18:45.320 --> 18:46.520
feed on the bounty

18:46.520 --> 18:47.220
that's produced

18:47.220 --> 18:47.840
by this,

18:48.400 --> 18:50.320
and then they return

18:50.320 --> 18:51.240
it to the earth.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.040
Isn't all of that

18:54.040 --> 18:54.480
dana?

18:54.480 --> 18:56.360
giving

18:56.360 --> 18:57.220
and receiving

18:57.220 --> 18:59.140
in unity.

19:01.020 --> 19:01.860
That's what

19:01.860 --> 19:02.320
this weekend

19:02.320 --> 19:02.960
is about.

19:04.140 --> 19:05.080
All of what

19:05.080 --> 19:05.720
I said

19:05.720 --> 19:08.260
are the words

19:08.260 --> 19:09.080
and the ideas

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
that describe it.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.360
Tomorrow

19:12.360 --> 19:13.360
you will have

19:13.360 --> 19:14.060
an opportunity

19:14.060 --> 19:14.980
to experience

19:14.980 --> 19:15.420
it

19:15.420 --> 19:16.640
yourself,

19:17.440 --> 19:18.260
to practice

19:18.260 --> 19:18.560
it

19:18.560 --> 19:19.180
yourself.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.480
You won't

19:21.480 --> 19:21.900
even

19:21.900 --> 19:23.460
taste it

19:23.460 --> 19:24.580
or get

19:24.580 --> 19:25.260
a glimmering

19:25.260 --> 19:25.660
of it

19:25.660 --> 19:27.500
if there's

19:27.500 --> 19:27.900
any

19:27.900 --> 19:29.040
self-centeredness

19:29.040 --> 19:29.500
involved

19:29.500 --> 19:30.020
in what you

19:30.020 --> 19:30.280
do.

19:31.940 --> 19:32.720
Abandon

19:32.720 --> 19:33.340
the self.

19:34.140 --> 19:34.520
Forget

19:34.520 --> 19:35.200
the self

19:35.200 --> 19:35.860
like you do

19:35.860 --> 19:36.520
in Zazen

19:36.520 --> 19:38.540
and give

19:38.540 --> 19:38.940
freely.

19:40.100 --> 19:40.820
Give yourself

19:40.820 --> 19:41.880
freely.

19:42.620 --> 19:43.260
Give yourself

19:43.260 --> 19:43.880
away

19:43.880 --> 19:45.440
freely.

19:46.980 --> 19:47.540
Your heart,

19:48.720 --> 19:49.360
your body,

19:49.940 --> 19:50.460
your labor,

19:51.140 --> 19:52.000
your presence,

19:52.420 --> 19:53.020
your love,

19:53.460 --> 19:54.140
your ear,

19:55.260 --> 19:55.820
whatever

19:55.820 --> 19:56.820
is needed.

19:58.300 --> 19:58.800
And if you

19:58.800 --> 19:59.300
do that,

20:00.360 --> 20:01.040
you'll find

20:01.040 --> 20:01.500
out

20:01.500 --> 20:03.500
what the

20:03.500 --> 20:04.020
Asatani

20:04.020 --> 20:04.380
Roshi

20:04.380 --> 20:04.880
knew

20:04.880 --> 20:06.140
for many,

20:06.280 --> 20:06.920
many years.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.200
You'll find

20:10.200 --> 20:10.560
out for

20:10.560 --> 20:10.980
yourself.

20:13.460 --> 20:13.720
So,

20:14.220 --> 20:14.860
again,

20:14.980 --> 20:15.480
thank you

20:15.480 --> 20:16.260
for your

20:16.260 --> 20:16.600
willingness

20:16.600 --> 20:18.200
willingness to

20:18.200 --> 20:18.720
be here,

20:19.480 --> 20:20.100
to participate

20:20.100 --> 20:22.020
in this

20:22.020 --> 20:23.300
practice of

20:23.300 --> 20:23.580
dana.

20:24.080 --> 20:24.680
What happens

20:24.680 --> 20:24.980
next,

20:25.060 --> 20:25.360
boss?

20:27.160 --> 20:27.520
Oh,

20:27.680 --> 20:28.020
all right.

20:29.300 --> 20:29.640
I didn't

20:29.640 --> 20:29.840
want to,

20:29.880 --> 20:30.520
I was late,

20:30.600 --> 20:30.800
and I'm

20:30.800 --> 20:31.420
sorry I was

20:31.420 --> 20:31.680
late.

20:31.800 --> 20:32.140
I was

20:32.140 --> 20:33.840
busily making

20:33.840 --> 20:35.660
notes and

20:35.660 --> 20:36.360
lost track of

20:36.360 --> 20:36.740
the time.

20:37.700 --> 20:37.900
Yeah,

20:37.980 --> 20:38.300
go ahead.

20:38.860 --> 20:39.580
Any questions?

20:39.580 --> 20:39.760
Any questions?

20:39.760 --> 20:44.660
Peter?

20:45.180 --> 20:45.420
Oh.

20:47.000 --> 20:47.560
Okay.

20:48.120 --> 20:48.860
Be easy on

20:48.860 --> 20:49.000
me,

20:49.060 --> 20:49.280
Peter.

20:49.560 --> 20:50.320
Last time

20:50.320 --> 20:51.280
you chewed

20:51.280 --> 20:51.660
me up.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.560
Is

20:54.560 --> 20:55.080
the

20:55.080 --> 20:55.760
dana dinner

20:55.760 --> 20:58.320
Christmas

20:58.320 --> 20:59.540
people

20:59.540 --> 21:01.060
who don't

21:01.060 --> 21:01.300
have

21:01.300 --> 21:01.940
Christmas

21:01.940 --> 21:02.580
or is

21:02.580 --> 21:03.420
it just

21:03.420 --> 21:03.820
for

21:03.820 --> 21:05.800
dana dinner?

21:07.000 --> 21:07.480
Well,

21:07.520 --> 21:07.740
what does

21:07.740 --> 21:08.220
dana dinner

21:08.220 --> 21:08.700
mean to

21:08.700 --> 21:08.980
you?

21:10.160 --> 21:10.760
When you

21:10.760 --> 21:10.980
say,

21:11.400 --> 21:12.200
or is it

21:12.200 --> 21:12.540
just

21:12.540 --> 21:13.260
dana dinner?

21:13.460 --> 21:13.600
So,

21:13.700 --> 21:14.060
I need to

21:14.060 --> 21:14.400
know what

21:14.400 --> 21:14.820
you mean

21:14.820 --> 21:16.480
by just

21:16.480 --> 21:17.080
dana dinner.

21:17.080 --> 21:17.460
I mean,

21:17.540 --> 21:18.080
is it just

21:18.080 --> 21:18.660
like that?

21:19.740 --> 21:20.460
Is it just

21:20.460 --> 21:20.900
a thing

21:20.900 --> 21:21.320
that's

21:21.320 --> 21:26.960
actually,

21:27.380 --> 21:27.700
I mean,

21:27.760 --> 21:28.120
what I've

21:28.120 --> 21:29.120
been saying,

21:29.620 --> 21:30.080
and let me

21:30.080 --> 21:30.740
say it again

21:30.740 --> 21:31.380
in a little

21:31.380 --> 21:32.000
bit of a

21:32.000 --> 21:32.640
different way,

21:33.760 --> 21:34.320
what it

21:34.320 --> 21:35.340
is for us

21:35.340 --> 21:36.620
as Buddhists

21:36.620 --> 21:38.540
here is

21:38.540 --> 21:39.460
a way to

21:39.460 --> 21:41.080
learn for

21:41.080 --> 21:41.820
ourselves

21:41.820 --> 21:43.380
what the

21:43.380 --> 21:45.020
Buddha was

21:45.020 --> 21:45.900
talking about,

21:46.980 --> 21:47.660
what the

21:47.660 --> 21:48.000
Buddha's

21:48.000 --> 21:48.460
teachings

21:48.460 --> 21:50.500
meant when

21:50.500 --> 21:50.940
they talked

21:50.940 --> 21:51.280
about

21:51.280 --> 21:51.680
dana,

21:52.640 --> 21:53.480
that dana

21:53.480 --> 21:56.480
is an

21:56.480 --> 21:57.300
act of

21:57.300 --> 21:58.520
giving and

21:58.520 --> 22:00.020
receiving at

22:00.020 --> 22:00.400
the same

22:00.400 --> 22:00.840
time.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.580
It's like

22:02.580 --> 22:06.000
when you

22:06.000 --> 22:08.340
stub your

22:08.340 --> 22:08.720
toe,

22:09.320 --> 22:11.480
it needs

22:11.480 --> 22:11.860
help,

22:12.620 --> 22:13.340
and you

22:13.340 --> 22:13.940
immediately

22:13.940 --> 22:14.780
give,

22:15.120 --> 22:15.800
you grab

22:15.800 --> 22:16.320
your foot

22:16.320 --> 22:16.760
and you

22:16.760 --> 22:17.280
hop around

22:17.280 --> 22:17.660
saying,

22:17.800 --> 22:17.940
ooh,

22:18.080 --> 22:18.380
ooh,

22:18.380 --> 22:18.800
ooh,

22:18.800 --> 22:20.440
and then

22:20.440 --> 22:21.260
you receive,

22:21.560 --> 22:21.960
you start

22:21.960 --> 22:22.600
feeling better.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.000
You

22:25.000 --> 22:27.440
give the

22:27.440 --> 22:27.980
nourishment,

22:28.180 --> 22:28.360
you know,

22:28.400 --> 22:28.860
you stroke

22:28.860 --> 22:29.260
yourself,

22:29.720 --> 22:30.460
and you

22:30.460 --> 22:31.300
receive it

22:31.300 --> 22:32.480
simultaneously.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.000
so that's

22:35.000 --> 22:35.720
what giving

22:35.720 --> 22:36.520
and receiving

22:36.520 --> 22:37.800
dana means

22:37.800 --> 22:38.320
to a

22:38.320 --> 22:38.660
Buddhist.

22:39.880 --> 22:40.360
And

22:40.360 --> 22:41.880
what we

22:41.880 --> 22:42.460
want to

22:42.460 --> 22:43.740
learn this

22:43.740 --> 22:44.140
weekend

22:44.140 --> 22:45.860
is how in

22:45.860 --> 22:46.700
this process

22:46.700 --> 22:48.100
of getting

22:48.100 --> 22:48.720
together with

22:48.720 --> 22:49.100
all these

22:49.100 --> 22:49.500
people

22:49.500 --> 22:51.740
to make

22:51.740 --> 22:52.320
that work.

22:52.820 --> 22:53.520
And if we

22:53.520 --> 22:54.100
can make it

22:54.100 --> 22:55.780
work here,

22:57.080 --> 22:57.400
you know,

22:57.440 --> 22:58.120
being very

22:58.120 --> 22:59.200
aware of it

22:59.200 --> 22:59.720
and conscious

22:59.720 --> 23:00.200
of it,

23:00.200 --> 23:01.100
maybe then

23:01.100 --> 23:01.400
we can

23:01.400 --> 23:01.700
make it

23:01.700 --> 23:02.040
work in

23:02.040 --> 23:02.480
the world.

23:03.360 --> 23:03.720
So it's

23:03.720 --> 23:04.100
not the

23:04.100 --> 23:04.520
same as

23:04.520 --> 23:05.440
walking along

23:05.440 --> 23:05.840
and there's

23:05.840 --> 23:06.360
some poor

23:06.360 --> 23:06.920
guy on the

23:06.920 --> 23:07.260
side of the

23:07.260 --> 23:07.700
road that

23:07.700 --> 23:07.980
says,

23:08.100 --> 23:08.240
do you

23:08.240 --> 23:08.620
have a

23:08.620 --> 23:09.860
quarter for

23:09.860 --> 23:10.280
a cup of

23:10.280 --> 23:10.640
coffee?

23:10.760 --> 23:10.920
And you

23:10.920 --> 23:11.100
say,

23:11.200 --> 23:11.460
sure,

23:11.600 --> 23:11.840
here.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.100
And they

23:13.100 --> 23:13.280
say,

23:13.320 --> 23:13.440
oh,

23:13.500 --> 23:13.840
thank you

23:13.840 --> 23:14.320
very much.

23:14.380 --> 23:14.540
You say,

23:14.600 --> 23:15.000
it's okay.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.020
And they

23:16.020 --> 23:16.400
go have a

23:16.400 --> 23:16.680
cup of

23:16.680 --> 23:17.040
coffee.

23:17.480 --> 23:17.840
That's

23:17.840 --> 23:18.420
charity.

23:19.040 --> 23:19.380
So it's

23:19.380 --> 23:20.140
not charity.

23:21.140 --> 23:21.420
You know,

23:21.460 --> 23:21.900
it's not

23:21.900 --> 23:23.360
being a

23:23.360 --> 23:24.060
benefactor.

23:24.400 --> 23:24.920
It's not

23:24.920 --> 23:25.280
making

23:25.280 --> 23:25.880
yourself

23:25.880 --> 23:27.560
higher,

23:27.880 --> 23:28.180
bigger,

23:28.360 --> 23:28.640
or more

23:28.640 --> 23:29.000
important.

23:29.140 --> 23:29.220
See,

23:29.220 --> 23:29.500
when you

23:29.500 --> 23:30.260
help somebody,

23:30.380 --> 23:31.280
usually that

23:31.280 --> 23:32.040
person is

23:32.040 --> 23:32.800
down and

23:32.800 --> 23:33.100
out and

23:33.100 --> 23:33.300
you're

23:33.300 --> 23:33.800
bigger and

23:33.800 --> 23:34.240
stronger.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.440
Donna makes

23:36.440 --> 23:37.080
you the

23:37.080 --> 23:38.960
same and

23:38.960 --> 23:41.400
then completely

23:41.400 --> 23:42.120
merged into

23:42.120 --> 23:42.620
one thing.

23:44.220 --> 23:44.760
So there's

23:44.760 --> 23:45.340
only Peter

23:45.340 --> 23:46.420
in the whole

23:46.420 --> 23:46.940
universe.

23:48.000 --> 23:48.960
He's swallowed

23:48.960 --> 23:49.680
up everything.

23:51.420 --> 23:51.680
Okay?

23:52.460 --> 23:53.280
Anyone else?

23:54.900 --> 23:55.760
Why do we do

23:55.760 --> 23:56.260
it at Christmas?

23:57.620 --> 23:58.600
We're actually,

23:58.600 --> 23:59.380
I mean,

23:59.460 --> 23:59.800
Christmas,

24:00.320 --> 24:02.340
that holiday

24:02.340 --> 24:03.480
time is,

24:03.700 --> 24:05.860
I mean,

24:05.960 --> 24:06.700
so obviously

24:06.700 --> 24:08.040
universal.

24:10.080 --> 24:10.360
You know,

24:10.760 --> 24:12.320
they even make

24:12.320 --> 24:12.820
a big deal

24:12.820 --> 24:13.220
out of it in

24:13.220 --> 24:14.040
Japan now.

24:14.540 --> 24:15.220
And as time

24:15.220 --> 24:15.960
goes on and

24:15.960 --> 24:16.480
the earth

24:16.480 --> 24:17.320
gets smaller,

24:18.040 --> 24:18.840
all the

24:18.840 --> 24:19.440
countries are

24:19.440 --> 24:19.840
doing it,

24:19.940 --> 24:20.580
even without

24:20.580 --> 24:22.120
any relationship

24:22.120 --> 24:23.020
to Christmas.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.840
what they've

24:24.840 --> 24:26.200
imported is

24:26.200 --> 24:26.840
the worst

24:26.840 --> 24:27.720
of what

24:27.720 --> 24:29.280
the whole

24:29.280 --> 24:29.680
thing is

24:29.680 --> 24:29.980
about.

24:30.100 --> 24:30.220
I mean,

24:30.260 --> 24:30.640
the whole

24:30.640 --> 24:31.920
concept of

24:31.920 --> 24:32.620
Christ and

24:32.620 --> 24:33.160
Christianity,

24:33.400 --> 24:34.220
and it's the

24:34.220 --> 24:35.060
Catholic Church's

24:35.060 --> 24:36.640
fault for

24:36.640 --> 24:37.140
doing that.

24:37.200 --> 24:37.700
Christ wasn't

24:37.700 --> 24:38.180
born in

24:38.180 --> 24:38.540
December.

24:38.600 --> 24:38.980
He was born

24:38.980 --> 24:39.660
in March.

24:40.640 --> 24:40.960
He's a

24:40.960 --> 24:41.540
Pisces.

24:41.540 --> 24:44.240
I have it

24:44.240 --> 24:44.460
from,

24:45.100 --> 24:45.520
yeah,

24:45.840 --> 24:46.720
yeah,

24:46.760 --> 24:47.240
he was.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.300
I knew he

24:49.300 --> 24:49.700
wasn't a

24:49.700 --> 24:50.140
Capricorn.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.480
Right.

24:52.600 --> 24:52.880
Right.

24:53.460 --> 24:53.760
I mean,

24:53.800 --> 24:54.260
most of the,

24:54.340 --> 24:54.500
I mean,

24:54.500 --> 24:55.100
Buddha was a

24:55.100 --> 24:55.940
Pisces too.

24:58.940 --> 24:59.500
Gurjeev,

24:59.580 --> 24:59.840
I mean,

24:59.840 --> 25:00.200
a lot of

25:00.200 --> 25:00.540
people,

25:01.360 --> 25:02.000
spiritual

25:02.000 --> 25:02.500
people.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.440
so what's

25:06.440 --> 25:07.320
happened is

25:07.320 --> 25:08.240
what happened

25:08.240 --> 25:08.760
is that

25:08.760 --> 25:09.620
the Druids

25:09.620 --> 25:10.320
had this

25:10.320 --> 25:11.600
pagan holiday

25:11.600 --> 25:13.160
which all

25:13.160 --> 25:13.680
the things

25:13.680 --> 25:14.540
that we

25:14.540 --> 25:15.300
call Christmas

25:15.300 --> 25:15.840
that people

25:15.840 --> 25:16.480
know as

25:16.480 --> 25:17.040
Christmas,

25:17.980 --> 25:18.640
giving of

25:18.640 --> 25:19.260
gifts,

25:19.520 --> 25:21.400
the mistletoe,

25:22.140 --> 25:22.840
the office

25:22.840 --> 25:23.540
party,

25:24.480 --> 25:25.780
getting

25:25.780 --> 25:26.600
drunk,

25:26.920 --> 25:28.140
all those

25:28.140 --> 25:28.580
things were

25:28.580 --> 25:29.080
part of

25:29.080 --> 25:29.520
that

25:29.520 --> 25:31.800
feast

25:31.800 --> 25:33.820
of the

25:33.820 --> 25:34.280
Druids

25:34.280 --> 25:35.580
and people

25:35.580 --> 25:36.280
continued to

25:36.280 --> 25:36.700
do it

25:36.700 --> 25:37.840
and so

25:37.840 --> 25:38.620
the Catholic

25:38.620 --> 25:39.760
Church

25:39.760 --> 25:41.060
moved the

25:41.060 --> 25:41.460
holiday

25:41.460 --> 25:42.900
to that

25:42.900 --> 25:43.420
time

25:43.420 --> 25:44.860
hoping to

25:44.860 --> 25:45.960
overcome it

25:45.960 --> 25:46.380
with the

25:46.380 --> 25:47.020
force of

25:47.020 --> 25:48.580
the birth of

25:48.580 --> 25:49.260
Christ and so

25:49.260 --> 25:49.720
on but what

25:49.720 --> 25:50.340
happened is

25:50.340 --> 25:51.140
they merged

25:51.140 --> 25:51.840
and became

25:51.840 --> 25:52.460
a kind of

25:52.460 --> 25:53.760
a mixture

25:53.760 --> 25:54.180
of both.

25:54.280 --> 25:54.620
Same thing

25:54.620 --> 25:55.380
with Halloween.

25:56.160 --> 25:56.680
Halloween,

25:56.980 --> 25:57.520
I was reading

25:57.520 --> 25:58.020
a thing,

25:58.220 --> 25:58.520
I don't know

25:58.520 --> 25:59.120
how true it

25:59.120 --> 25:59.280
is,

25:59.480 --> 26:00.240
it was put

26:00.240 --> 26:01.020
out by the

26:01.020 --> 26:02.740
born again

26:02.740 --> 26:03.320
Christians,

26:03.800 --> 26:04.640
how evil

26:04.640 --> 26:05.720
Halloween is

26:05.720 --> 26:06.060
and that

26:06.060 --> 26:06.820
it's really

26:06.820 --> 26:07.880
devil worshippers

26:07.880 --> 26:08.640
and so on

26:08.640 --> 26:09.400
and they

26:09.400 --> 26:09.860
traced the

26:09.860 --> 26:10.440
holiday back

26:10.440 --> 26:11.160
also to a

26:11.160 --> 26:11.900
Druid thing

26:11.900 --> 26:13.320
and it had

26:13.320 --> 26:14.020
to do with

26:14.020 --> 26:14.700
the rising

26:14.700 --> 26:15.500
of the dead

26:15.500 --> 26:15.940
and the

26:15.940 --> 26:16.980
worship of

26:16.980 --> 26:17.940
demons

26:17.940 --> 26:18.600
and stuff

26:18.600 --> 26:19.220
like that

26:19.220 --> 26:21.720
and there

26:21.720 --> 26:22.080
was a lot

26:22.080 --> 26:22.720
more to it

26:22.720 --> 26:23.580
and they

26:23.580 --> 26:24.740
made that

26:24.740 --> 26:26.620
Hallow Eve

26:26.620 --> 26:27.420
All Saints

26:27.420 --> 26:27.740
Day

26:27.740 --> 26:28.780
and that

26:28.780 --> 26:29.120
too

26:29.120 --> 26:30.320
ended up

26:30.320 --> 26:30.980
kind of

26:30.980 --> 26:31.420
a merge

26:31.420 --> 26:31.980
thing.

26:32.100 --> 26:32.680
So what

26:32.680 --> 26:34.600
I'd like to

26:34.600 --> 26:35.320
see us do

26:35.320 --> 26:35.740
with that

26:35.740 --> 26:36.340
same thing

26:36.340 --> 26:36.800
and actually

26:36.800 --> 26:37.480
we do this

26:37.480 --> 26:38.160
close to the

26:38.160 --> 26:38.660
solstice,

26:38.780 --> 26:39.040
the winter

26:39.040 --> 26:39.600
solstice,

26:40.320 --> 26:40.820
I mean clearly

26:40.820 --> 26:41.240
the winter

26:41.240 --> 26:42.160
solstice is a

26:42.160 --> 26:42.580
time for

26:42.580 --> 26:43.200
celebration.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.420
All cultures

26:44.420 --> 26:45.600
celebrate the

26:45.600 --> 26:47.240
various solstice

26:47.240 --> 26:48.480
holidays and

26:48.480 --> 26:49.100
equinoxes

26:49.100 --> 26:50.320
because there

26:50.320 --> 26:51.000
are times of

26:51.000 --> 26:51.500
transition

26:51.500 --> 26:53.140
and here

26:53.140 --> 26:54.060
the solstice,

26:54.200 --> 26:54.860
the days will

26:54.860 --> 26:55.460
begin to get

26:55.460 --> 26:57.060
longer and

26:57.060 --> 26:57.700
the approach

26:57.700 --> 26:58.300
of spring

26:58.300 --> 26:59.240
is a cause

26:59.240 --> 27:00.000
for celebration

27:00.000 --> 27:02.960
and my

27:02.960 --> 27:03.780
problem with

27:03.780 --> 27:05.020
it is that

27:05.020 --> 27:06.220
it has become

27:06.220 --> 27:08.140
so awful

27:08.140 --> 27:11.500
to go down

27:11.500 --> 27:12.180
to the mall

27:12.180 --> 27:12.760
and to see

27:12.760 --> 27:13.440
the looks on

27:13.440 --> 27:14.340
people's faces

27:14.340 --> 27:16.160
they're in pain

27:16.160 --> 27:16.940
they're in agony

27:16.940 --> 27:18.340
and then to see

27:18.340 --> 27:19.040
what happens

27:19.040 --> 27:19.800
with the gifts

27:19.800 --> 27:21.180
it's a gesture

27:21.180 --> 27:22.580
it's not really

27:22.580 --> 27:23.500
even giving

27:23.500 --> 27:24.320
not even in the

27:24.320 --> 27:24.980
remotest thing

27:24.980 --> 27:25.520
for the most

27:25.520 --> 27:25.880
part

27:25.880 --> 27:28.500
and I'd like

27:28.500 --> 27:29.020
to see what

27:29.020 --> 27:29.580
the garbage

27:29.580 --> 27:30.600
dumps look like

27:30.600 --> 27:31.260
a week after

27:31.260 --> 27:31.840
Christmas

27:31.840 --> 27:32.840
with all the

27:32.840 --> 27:33.340
things that get

27:33.340 --> 27:34.140
thrown away

27:34.140 --> 27:35.460
and all the

27:35.460 --> 27:36.200
waste that's

27:36.200 --> 27:37.160
created because

27:37.160 --> 27:37.540
of it

27:37.540 --> 27:39.480
and we're just

27:39.480 --> 27:40.060
as bad

27:40.060 --> 27:40.660
I mean we're

27:40.660 --> 27:41.480
not much

27:41.480 --> 27:41.840
better

27:41.840 --> 27:42.780
but I'm

27:42.780 --> 27:44.040
hoping this

27:44.040 --> 27:45.380
year is where

27:45.380 --> 27:46.160
it really struck

27:46.160 --> 27:48.380
me that we

27:48.380 --> 27:49.360
need to do

27:49.360 --> 27:50.760
something to

27:50.760 --> 27:51.680
make it a

27:51.680 --> 27:52.160
little bit

27:52.160 --> 27:53.440
more in

27:53.440 --> 27:54.240
line with

27:54.240 --> 27:56.340
what our

27:56.340 --> 27:56.980
understanding

27:56.980 --> 27:58.040
of Dana

27:58.040 --> 27:58.860
is

27:58.860 --> 27:59.940
in the

27:59.940 --> 28:00.580
same way

28:00.580 --> 28:01.480
that you

28:01.480 --> 28:01.780
know you

28:01.780 --> 28:03.020
can't

28:03.020 --> 28:04.160
you can't

28:04.160 --> 28:04.660
beat

28:04.660 --> 28:06.260
the forces

28:06.260 --> 28:07.740
of the

28:07.740 --> 28:08.280
universe

28:08.280 --> 28:09.960
by just

28:09.960 --> 28:10.740
opposing them

28:10.740 --> 28:11.120
you can't

28:11.120 --> 28:11.500
just throw

28:11.500 --> 28:12.120
up a barrier

28:12.120 --> 28:12.900
so for

28:12.900 --> 28:13.360
example

28:13.360 --> 28:14.220
the media

28:14.220 --> 28:16.340
has done

28:16.340 --> 28:17.000
some awful

28:17.000 --> 28:17.520
stuff

28:17.520 --> 28:18.860
I mean the

28:18.860 --> 28:19.640
reason there

28:19.640 --> 28:20.960
is home

28:20.960 --> 28:21.440
video

28:21.440 --> 28:23.600
and interactive

28:23.600 --> 28:24.580
CD-ROM

28:24.580 --> 28:25.180
is because

28:25.180 --> 28:25.920
of pornography

28:25.920 --> 28:27.340
that's what

28:27.340 --> 28:27.900
if it wasn't

28:27.900 --> 28:28.660
for pornography

28:28.660 --> 28:29.360
those things

28:29.360 --> 28:29.860
never would

28:29.860 --> 28:30.120
have been

28:30.120 --> 28:30.400
born

28:30.400 --> 28:31.700
that's the

28:31.700 --> 28:33.040
multi-billion

28:33.040 --> 28:33.880
dollar industry

28:33.880 --> 28:34.640
that's underneath

28:34.640 --> 28:34.980
it

28:34.980 --> 28:35.800
so what do

28:35.800 --> 28:36.200
you do

28:36.200 --> 28:36.680
you say

28:36.680 --> 28:37.000
okay

28:37.000 --> 28:38.600
we won't

28:38.600 --> 28:39.980
use CD-ROMs

28:39.980 --> 28:40.300
and we'll

28:40.300 --> 28:40.760
never look

28:40.760 --> 28:41.240
at a video

28:41.240 --> 28:42.880
that's not

28:42.880 --> 28:43.380
the answer

28:43.380 --> 28:43.860
to it

28:43.860 --> 28:45.500
the media

28:45.500 --> 28:47.720
is neutral

28:47.720 --> 28:48.920
it's the

28:48.920 --> 28:49.560
artists and

28:49.560 --> 28:49.900
the people

28:49.900 --> 28:50.380
that put it

28:50.380 --> 28:50.740
together

28:50.740 --> 28:51.300
that make

28:51.300 --> 28:52.140
it what

28:52.140 --> 28:52.660
it is

28:52.660 --> 28:53.540
you know

28:53.540 --> 28:54.060
it's like

28:54.060 --> 28:54.780
condemning

28:54.780 --> 28:56.680
cotton

28:56.680 --> 28:57.260
or

28:57.260 --> 29:00.520
metal

29:00.520 --> 29:01.700
because it's

29:01.700 --> 29:02.240
made into

29:02.240 --> 29:03.260
a gun

29:03.260 --> 29:05.220
how can we

29:05.220 --> 29:06.000
use these

29:06.000 --> 29:06.940
things in

29:06.940 --> 29:07.580
a way that

29:07.580 --> 29:08.220
nourishes

29:08.220 --> 29:08.820
rather than

29:08.820 --> 29:09.280
poisons

29:09.280 --> 29:10.140
photography

29:10.140 --> 29:10.960
is a

29:10.960 --> 29:11.280
wonderful

29:11.280 --> 29:11.760
media

29:11.760 --> 29:12.880
it poisons

29:12.880 --> 29:14.040
but it also

29:14.040 --> 29:14.600
nourishes

29:14.600 --> 29:15.040
and it

29:15.040 --> 29:15.420
heals

29:15.420 --> 29:16.360
and it

29:16.360 --> 29:16.820
depends on

29:16.820 --> 29:17.200
how you

29:17.200 --> 29:17.640
use it

29:17.640 --> 29:18.340
so I

29:18.340 --> 29:18.640
think it's

29:18.640 --> 29:19.200
the same

29:19.200 --> 29:19.660
with a lot

29:19.660 --> 29:20.040
of things

29:20.040 --> 29:20.360
in our

29:20.360 --> 29:20.820
society

29:20.820 --> 29:21.140
they're not

29:21.140 --> 29:21.320
going to

29:21.320 --> 29:21.780
go away

29:21.780 --> 29:23.060
so how

29:23.060 --> 29:23.440
can we

29:23.440 --> 29:24.000
use them

29:24.000 --> 29:25.160
to nourish

29:25.160 --> 29:25.660
and that's

29:25.660 --> 29:26.380
basically what

29:26.380 --> 29:27.080
we're exploring

29:27.080 --> 29:28.340
with this

29:28.340 --> 29:29.780
holiday

29:29.780 --> 29:31.060
everybody's

29:31.060 --> 29:31.560
already into

29:31.560 --> 29:32.060
the holiday

29:32.060 --> 29:33.340
and they're

29:33.340 --> 29:33.680
going to do

29:33.680 --> 29:34.260
it one way

29:34.260 --> 29:34.620
or another

29:34.620 --> 29:35.360
and the

29:35.360 --> 29:35.780
people that

29:35.780 --> 29:36.300
can't do

29:36.300 --> 29:36.560
it

29:36.560 --> 29:38.840
because of

29:38.840 --> 29:40.200
circumstances

29:40.200 --> 29:41.080
because they

29:41.080 --> 29:41.900
don't have

29:41.900 --> 29:44.680
the luxury

29:44.680 --> 29:45.600
of choice

29:45.600 --> 29:46.240
like we

29:46.240 --> 29:46.660
have

29:46.660 --> 29:48.200
become

29:48.200 --> 29:49.000
despondent

29:49.000 --> 29:49.600
and disturbed

29:49.600 --> 29:50.160
by it

29:50.160 --> 29:51.180
by not

29:51.180 --> 29:51.900
having that

29:51.900 --> 29:52.960
so this is

29:52.960 --> 29:53.580
an opportunity

29:53.580 --> 29:54.220
to do

29:54.220 --> 29:54.920
something there

29:54.920 --> 29:55.460
but to do

29:55.460 --> 29:56.460
something in a

29:56.460 --> 29:57.840
nourishing way

29:57.840 --> 29:58.480
more positive

29:58.480 --> 29:58.680
way

29:58.680 --> 30:06.560
I think you

30:06.560 --> 30:06.840
do

30:06.840 --> 30:07.800
I've told

30:07.800 --> 30:08.480
a lot of

30:08.480 --> 30:09.040
my students

30:09.040 --> 30:09.520
here the

30:09.520 --> 30:09.980
story of

30:09.980 --> 30:10.300
when I

30:10.300 --> 30:11.140
first started

30:11.140 --> 30:12.020
teaching

30:12.020 --> 30:13.040
it was very

30:13.040 --> 30:13.780
difficult for

30:13.780 --> 30:14.540
me to have

30:14.540 --> 30:15.360
what's called

30:15.360 --> 30:15.860
an anja

30:15.860 --> 30:16.940
an attendant

30:16.940 --> 30:18.440
that takes

30:18.440 --> 30:19.160
care of

30:19.160 --> 30:19.900
the teacher

30:19.900 --> 30:21.240
the reason

30:21.240 --> 30:21.500
it was

30:21.500 --> 30:22.180
difficult for

30:22.180 --> 30:22.880
me is that

30:22.880 --> 30:24.180
my father

30:24.180 --> 30:24.720
died when I

30:24.720 --> 30:25.040
was very

30:25.040 --> 30:25.380
young

30:25.380 --> 30:27.060
and we

30:27.060 --> 30:27.660
were pretty

30:27.660 --> 30:28.140
well all

30:28.140 --> 30:28.580
family

30:28.580 --> 30:29.860
and he

30:29.860 --> 30:30.400
was a

30:30.400 --> 30:30.920
politician

30:30.920 --> 30:32.260
at the

30:32.260 --> 30:32.940
state level

30:32.940 --> 30:34.660
and my

30:34.660 --> 30:35.520
mother was

30:35.520 --> 30:36.080
you know

30:36.080 --> 30:36.900
hostess to

30:36.900 --> 30:37.240
all these

30:37.240 --> 30:37.900
important people

30:37.900 --> 30:38.260
and everything

30:38.260 --> 30:38.640
and then he

30:38.640 --> 30:39.040
died

30:39.040 --> 30:39.840
didn't believe

30:39.840 --> 30:40.420
in insurance

30:40.420 --> 30:40.860
you know

30:40.860 --> 30:41.340
this was

30:41.340 --> 30:42.380
1939

30:42.380 --> 30:44.480
and so he

30:44.480 --> 30:45.020
left us

30:45.020 --> 30:45.520
basically

30:45.520 --> 30:46.220
penniless

30:46.220 --> 30:47.320
my mother

30:47.320 --> 30:47.840
had to go

30:47.840 --> 30:48.420
to work

30:48.420 --> 30:49.020
but she

30:49.020 --> 30:49.500
really didn't

30:49.500 --> 30:49.900
have any

30:49.900 --> 30:50.260
skills

30:50.260 --> 30:50.780
women in

30:50.780 --> 30:51.180
those days

30:51.180 --> 30:51.660
didn't

30:51.660 --> 30:53.620
and so

30:53.620 --> 30:54.060
she went

30:54.060 --> 30:54.700
to school

30:54.700 --> 30:55.740
and worked

30:55.740 --> 30:57.140
and was

30:57.140 --> 30:58.040
cleaning house

30:58.040 --> 31:00.200
and avoiding

31:00.200 --> 31:02.980
I mean she

31:02.980 --> 31:03.500
was just too

31:03.500 --> 31:04.020
proud to

31:04.020 --> 31:04.480
take what

31:04.480 --> 31:04.900
was called

31:04.900 --> 31:05.340
relief

31:05.340 --> 31:05.860
same as

31:05.860 --> 31:06.280
welfare

31:06.280 --> 31:06.660
now she

31:06.660 --> 31:07.040
would never

31:07.040 --> 31:07.580
take it

31:07.580 --> 31:10.840
but I

31:10.840 --> 31:11.240
would find

31:11.240 --> 31:11.760
her crying

31:11.760 --> 31:12.660
at night

31:12.660 --> 31:14.280
because she

31:14.280 --> 31:15.660
was cleaning

31:15.660 --> 31:16.680
houses for

31:16.680 --> 31:17.160
the people

31:17.160 --> 31:17.600
that she

31:17.600 --> 31:17.940
was the

31:17.940 --> 31:18.820
hostess for

31:18.820 --> 31:20.100
years before

31:20.100 --> 31:20.800
you know

31:20.800 --> 31:21.920
she was a

31:21.920 --> 31:22.420
housekeeper

31:22.420 --> 31:25.260
and it

31:25.260 --> 31:25.960
really bothered

31:25.960 --> 31:27.160
me that

31:27.160 --> 31:27.740
I mean it

31:27.740 --> 31:28.580
imprinted me

31:28.580 --> 31:29.180
pretty deeply

31:29.180 --> 31:29.660
I was nine

31:29.660 --> 31:30.180
years old

31:30.180 --> 31:32.160
later when I

31:32.160 --> 31:32.680
got married

31:32.680 --> 31:33.260
and was

31:33.260 --> 31:34.420
making a

31:34.420 --> 31:34.980
lot of

31:34.980 --> 31:35.260
money

31:35.260 --> 31:37.140
my wife

31:37.140 --> 31:37.560
wanted a

31:37.560 --> 31:38.060
housekeeper

31:38.060 --> 31:40.320
and somebody

31:40.320 --> 31:40.740
would come in

31:40.740 --> 31:41.040
and actually

31:41.040 --> 31:41.780
even cook for

31:41.780 --> 31:42.560
us and I

31:42.560 --> 31:43.320
kept resisting

31:43.320 --> 31:43.980
it and then

31:43.980 --> 31:45.000
finally I

31:45.000 --> 31:46.440
agreed to

31:46.440 --> 31:46.860
do it

31:46.860 --> 31:48.700
and we'd

31:48.700 --> 31:49.060
have this

31:49.060 --> 31:49.860
woman come

31:49.860 --> 31:51.000
in who

31:51.000 --> 31:51.520
cleaned the

31:51.520 --> 31:52.100
house and

31:52.100 --> 31:52.760
would feed

31:52.760 --> 31:53.200
the kids

31:53.200 --> 31:53.540
and then

31:53.540 --> 31:54.220
serve us

31:54.220 --> 31:54.600
in another

31:54.600 --> 31:55.020
room I

31:55.020 --> 31:55.660
felt so

31:55.660 --> 31:56.360
awful you

31:56.360 --> 31:56.500
know I

31:56.500 --> 31:56.900
kept thinking

31:56.900 --> 31:57.200
of my

31:57.200 --> 31:59.180
mother just

31:59.180 --> 31:59.680
couldn't do

31:59.680 --> 32:00.160
it you know

32:00.160 --> 32:01.380
and so we

32:01.380 --> 32:02.140
finally stopped

32:02.140 --> 32:02.960
that big

32:02.960 --> 32:03.800
arguments over

32:03.800 --> 32:05.240
it so years

32:05.240 --> 32:05.720
later I

32:05.720 --> 32:06.160
become a

32:06.160 --> 32:07.200
teacher and

32:07.200 --> 32:07.700
part of being

32:07.700 --> 32:08.600
a teacher is

32:08.600 --> 32:09.320
you have a

32:09.320 --> 32:11.100
group of

32:11.100 --> 32:12.040
attendants a

32:12.040 --> 32:13.620
personal

32:13.620 --> 32:14.340
attendant a

32:14.340 --> 32:15.780
secretary a

32:15.780 --> 32:16.960
housekeeper and

32:16.960 --> 32:18.880
all that but

32:18.880 --> 32:19.460
I wasn't going to

32:19.460 --> 32:19.900
do that

32:19.900 --> 32:22.840
and so one

32:22.840 --> 32:23.640
day my

32:23.640 --> 32:24.180
teacher was

32:24.180 --> 32:24.880
visiting me

32:24.880 --> 32:25.480
and we're

32:25.480 --> 32:25.740
at the

32:25.740 --> 32:26.060
house and

32:26.060 --> 32:26.400
I'm running

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
around serving

32:27.400 --> 32:28.240
him cooking

32:28.240 --> 32:28.780
getting his

32:28.780 --> 32:29.180
ready he

32:29.180 --> 32:29.880
says I

32:29.880 --> 32:30.160
don't want

32:30.160 --> 32:30.460
you to have

32:30.460 --> 32:31.100
your Anja do

32:31.100 --> 32:32.460
that and I

32:32.460 --> 32:33.100
had been his

32:33.100 --> 32:34.160
Anja and I

32:34.160 --> 32:34.640
had been his

32:34.640 --> 32:35.640
G ship so I

32:35.640 --> 32:36.600
knew how to do

32:36.600 --> 32:38.460
it so I said

32:38.460 --> 32:39.120
no I don't have

32:39.120 --> 32:41.320
an Anja proudly

32:41.320 --> 32:42.740
a little bit of

32:42.740 --> 32:43.800
pride no I

32:43.800 --> 32:44.480
don't have an

32:44.480 --> 32:45.360
Anja I'm a

32:45.360 --> 32:47.400
regular guy he

32:47.400 --> 32:47.940
said how can

32:47.940 --> 32:48.440
you be so

32:48.440 --> 32:49.040
selfish

32:49.040 --> 32:51.160
I said why

32:51.160 --> 32:52.400
he said what

32:52.400 --> 32:52.780
do you mean

32:52.780 --> 32:53.980
he said how

32:53.980 --> 32:54.580
can you be so

32:54.580 --> 32:55.560
selfish and not

32:55.560 --> 32:57.340
allow your

32:57.340 --> 32:58.200
students to

32:58.200 --> 32:58.900
serve you to

32:58.900 --> 33:00.440
give back to

33:00.440 --> 33:01.340
you what you

33:01.340 --> 33:02.000
give to them

33:02.000 --> 33:04.680
and it changed

33:04.680 --> 33:06.340
my whole notion

33:06.340 --> 33:06.980
about that

33:06.980 --> 33:08.860
and I suddenly

33:08.860 --> 33:09.580
started doing

33:09.580 --> 33:10.220
it I'm still

33:10.220 --> 33:11.140
uncomfortable with

33:11.140 --> 33:12.900
it but I

33:12.900 --> 33:13.460
feel it's an

33:13.460 --> 33:14.420
important part of

33:14.420 --> 33:15.260
the whole process

33:15.260 --> 33:16.060
that they need

33:16.060 --> 33:16.920
to otherwise

33:16.920 --> 33:17.560
they become

33:17.560 --> 33:18.940
thieves they

33:18.940 --> 33:20.720
take and

33:20.720 --> 33:21.040
don't give

33:21.040 --> 33:21.320
and they

33:21.320 --> 33:21.920
feel awful

33:21.920 --> 33:22.540
about it

33:22.540 --> 33:23.580
they want

33:23.580 --> 33:23.800
to

33:23.800 --> 33:24.680
students want

33:24.680 --> 33:25.740
to give

33:25.740 --> 33:26.200
back

33:26.200 --> 33:27.220
I know I

33:27.220 --> 33:27.700
did when I

33:27.700 --> 33:28.100
was serving

33:28.100 --> 33:28.520
my teacher

33:28.520 --> 33:29.260
I felt great

33:29.260 --> 33:30.280
but we used

33:30.280 --> 33:30.740
to fight

33:30.740 --> 33:31.300
over who

33:31.300 --> 33:31.640
could do

33:31.640 --> 33:32.340
it

33:32.340 --> 33:33.560
what about

33:33.560 --> 33:33.580
what about

33:33.580 --> 33:33.900
if you're

33:33.900 --> 33:34.360
on the end

33:34.360 --> 33:34.900
of wanting

33:34.900 --> 33:35.720
to give

33:35.720 --> 33:36.200
back

33:36.200 --> 33:38.860
say that

33:38.860 --> 33:39.060
again

33:39.060 --> 33:39.880
are you

33:39.880 --> 33:40.520
stuck

33:40.520 --> 33:41.340
not

33:41.340 --> 33:42.200
having

33:42.200 --> 33:42.760
Donna

33:42.760 --> 33:44.140
if the

33:44.140 --> 33:44.760
other person

33:44.760 --> 33:45.720
doesn't give

33:45.720 --> 33:46.080
back

33:46.080 --> 33:46.760
or is there

33:46.760 --> 33:47.040
something

33:47.040 --> 33:48.140
that you

33:48.140 --> 33:48.460
can

33:48.460 --> 33:48.960
oh no

33:48.960 --> 33:49.940
they don't

33:49.940 --> 33:50.800
it's not

33:50.800 --> 33:51.940
there's no

33:51.940 --> 33:52.960
conscious giving

33:52.960 --> 33:53.800
on their part

33:53.800 --> 33:55.160
there's no

33:55.160 --> 33:55.360
conscious

33:55.360 --> 33:56.000
I mean

33:56.000 --> 33:56.720
Lenny

33:56.720 --> 33:57.480
mentioned

33:57.480 --> 33:58.260
last night

33:58.260 --> 33:58.660
when we were

33:58.660 --> 33:59.260
at the prison

33:59.260 --> 34:00.160
and I

34:00.160 --> 34:00.880
mentioned it

34:00.880 --> 34:01.340
before

34:01.340 --> 34:02.260
every time

34:02.260 --> 34:02.620
we go to

34:02.620 --> 34:03.120
the prison

34:03.120 --> 34:04.260
to work

34:04.260 --> 34:04.500
with the

34:04.500 --> 34:04.820
prisoners

34:04.820 --> 34:05.220
you know

34:05.220 --> 34:06.120
we're like

34:06.120 --> 34:06.620
the heroes

34:06.620 --> 34:07.180
we come in

34:07.180 --> 34:07.500
from the

34:07.500 --> 34:07.860
outside

34:07.860 --> 34:08.800
and we're

34:08.800 --> 34:10.660
doing something

34:10.660 --> 34:11.080
for them

34:11.080 --> 34:11.520
we're bringing

34:11.520 --> 34:12.060
the Dharma

34:12.060 --> 34:12.520
to them

34:12.520 --> 34:12.940
and everything

34:12.940 --> 34:14.200
and by the

34:14.200 --> 34:14.660
time we're

34:14.660 --> 34:15.020
finished

34:15.020 --> 34:15.760
we're all

34:15.760 --> 34:16.520
walking away

34:16.520 --> 34:16.920
with our

34:16.920 --> 34:17.580
tails between

34:17.580 --> 34:17.960
our legs

34:17.960 --> 34:18.520
because we've

34:18.520 --> 34:19.420
received so much

34:19.420 --> 34:20.640
it seems so

34:20.640 --> 34:21.380
lopsided

34:21.380 --> 34:22.740
you know

34:22.740 --> 34:23.940
and it's not

34:23.940 --> 34:26.060
it's not

34:26.060 --> 34:26.860
that physically

34:26.860 --> 34:28.160
they're saying

34:28.160 --> 34:28.500
okay

34:28.500 --> 34:29.200
you gave me

34:29.200 --> 34:29.580
this now

34:29.580 --> 34:29.800
I'm going

34:29.800 --> 34:30.040
to give

34:30.040 --> 34:30.460
you this

34:30.460 --> 34:30.940
it's just

34:30.940 --> 34:31.380
that it

34:31.380 --> 34:31.860
happens

34:31.860 --> 34:32.380
by the

34:32.380 --> 34:33.380
it's like

34:33.380 --> 34:34.040
making love

34:34.040 --> 34:35.280
you know

34:35.280 --> 34:35.720
nobody's

34:35.720 --> 34:36.240
thinking about

34:36.240 --> 34:36.660
okay you

34:36.660 --> 34:37.140
kiss me

34:37.140 --> 34:37.480
and I'll

34:37.480 --> 34:37.960
kiss you

34:37.960 --> 34:38.320
and you

34:38.320 --> 34:38.780
touch me

34:38.780 --> 34:38.960
I'll

34:38.960 --> 34:39.280
touch you

34:39.280 --> 34:39.980
you know

34:39.980 --> 34:40.660
you just

34:40.660 --> 34:41.460
do it

34:41.460 --> 34:44.840
the birds

34:44.840 --> 34:45.640
do it

34:45.640 --> 34:48.100
and the bees

34:48.100 --> 34:48.740
do it

34:48.740 --> 34:51.460
anybody else

34:51.460 --> 34:52.480
well you

34:52.480 --> 34:53.220
practice that

34:53.220 --> 34:53.640
the way you

34:53.640 --> 34:54.220
practice

34:54.220 --> 34:55.520
you know

34:55.520 --> 34:56.120
your breath

34:56.120 --> 34:57.060
so it

34:57.060 --> 34:57.740
comes up

34:57.740 --> 34:59.620
any thought

34:59.620 --> 35:01.020
I'm good

35:01.020 --> 35:01.620
I'm bad

35:01.620 --> 35:02.560
I'm Santa

35:02.560 --> 35:03.020
Claus

35:03.020 --> 35:07.520
you acknowledge

35:07.520 --> 35:08.160
it throw it

35:08.160 --> 35:08.520
away

35:08.520 --> 35:09.920
come back

35:09.920 --> 35:10.200
to the

35:10.200 --> 35:10.540
moment

35:10.540 --> 35:13.380
I mean

35:13.380 --> 35:14.060
it's

35:14.060 --> 35:15.220
it's

35:15.220 --> 35:15.900
when I

35:15.900 --> 35:16.100
say

35:16.100 --> 35:16.820
nourishment

35:16.820 --> 35:17.860
to be

35:17.860 --> 35:18.520
nourished

35:18.520 --> 35:20.020
it's kind

35:20.020 --> 35:20.460
of a

35:20.460 --> 35:21.080
vague

35:21.080 --> 35:22.300
intangible

35:22.300 --> 35:23.700
term

35:23.700 --> 35:25.840
but I've

35:25.840 --> 35:26.860
talked about

35:26.860 --> 35:28.540
nourishment

35:28.540 --> 35:29.420
in terms

35:29.420 --> 35:30.160
of photography

35:30.160 --> 35:30.900
for example

35:30.900 --> 35:31.520
or in

35:31.520 --> 35:31.900
terms of

35:31.900 --> 35:32.200
art

35:32.200 --> 35:32.840
or music

35:32.840 --> 35:34.900
there is

35:34.900 --> 35:35.420
art

35:35.420 --> 35:36.460
that poisons

35:36.460 --> 35:38.300
and there's

35:38.300 --> 35:38.820
art that

35:38.820 --> 35:39.460
nourishes

35:39.460 --> 35:41.420
art that

35:41.420 --> 35:42.020
poisons

35:42.020 --> 35:44.660
is art

35:44.660 --> 35:45.120
that when

35:45.120 --> 35:45.360
you've

35:45.360 --> 35:46.000
experienced

35:46.000 --> 35:46.200
it

35:46.200 --> 35:46.700
a photograph

35:46.700 --> 35:47.540
a painting

35:47.540 --> 35:48.080
piece of

35:48.080 --> 35:48.540
music

35:48.540 --> 35:50.160
and then

35:50.160 --> 35:50.720
walk away

35:50.720 --> 35:51.100
from it

35:51.100 --> 35:51.720
you feel

35:51.720 --> 35:52.160
as if

35:52.160 --> 35:52.400
you've

35:52.400 --> 35:52.620
lost

35:52.620 --> 35:53.080
something

35:53.080 --> 35:54.100
something

35:54.100 --> 35:54.440
has

35:54.440 --> 35:57.460
been taken

35:57.460 --> 35:57.940
away

35:57.940 --> 36:00.000
art that

36:00.000 --> 36:00.520
nourishes

36:00.520 --> 36:01.800
when you

36:01.800 --> 36:02.300
walk away

36:02.300 --> 36:02.840
from it

36:02.840 --> 36:03.940
you feel

36:03.940 --> 36:04.600
that you've

36:04.600 --> 36:05.140
received

36:05.140 --> 36:05.640
something

36:05.640 --> 36:06.740
you feel

36:06.740 --> 36:08.420
nicer

36:08.420 --> 36:09.000
better

36:09.000 --> 36:10.480
greater

36:10.480 --> 36:11.520
so

36:11.520 --> 36:12.180
nourishment

36:12.180 --> 36:12.660
is what

36:12.660 --> 36:14.000
I hope

36:14.000 --> 36:14.580
spiritual

36:14.580 --> 36:15.220
nourishment

36:15.220 --> 36:15.900
to take

36:15.900 --> 36:16.220
away

36:16.220 --> 36:16.820
as well

36:16.820 --> 36:17.640
as some

36:17.640 --> 36:18.060
pretty good

36:18.060 --> 36:18.460
food

36:18.460 --> 36:19.800
I mean

36:19.800 --> 36:20.380
those turkeys

36:20.380 --> 36:21.200
are nothing

36:21.200 --> 36:22.000
to scoff

36:22.000 --> 36:22.320
at

36:22.320 --> 36:27.340
you're the

36:27.340 --> 36:27.780
last one

36:27.780 --> 36:28.000
Peter

36:28.000 --> 36:28.540
you started

36:28.540 --> 36:28.980
and you're

36:28.980 --> 36:29.120
going to

36:29.120 --> 36:29.520
close it

36:29.520 --> 36:29.960
go ahead

36:29.960 --> 36:31.380
say that

36:31.380 --> 36:32.300
last line

36:32.300 --> 36:32.580
again

36:32.580 --> 36:33.640
you gave

36:33.640 --> 36:39.180
thanks to

36:39.180 --> 36:39.460
her

36:39.460 --> 36:40.680
what doesn't

36:40.680 --> 36:41.040
make any

36:41.040 --> 36:42.440
well the

36:42.440 --> 36:42.960
best one

36:42.960 --> 36:44.400
to talk

36:44.400 --> 36:44.900
to about

36:44.900 --> 36:45.380
that I

36:45.380 --> 36:46.100
guess is

36:46.100 --> 36:47.800
guess who

36:47.800 --> 36:55.120
I mean I'm

36:55.120 --> 36:55.940
a father

36:55.940 --> 36:57.920
and I

36:57.920 --> 36:58.680
feel good

36:58.680 --> 37:00.000
when my

37:00.000 --> 37:00.480
kids feel

37:00.480 --> 37:00.820
good

37:00.820 --> 37:02.220
so whenever

37:02.220 --> 37:02.720
I can do

37:02.720 --> 37:03.260
something to

37:03.260 --> 37:04.200
help my

37:04.200 --> 37:04.640
kids

37:04.640 --> 37:05.480
I mean

37:05.480 --> 37:05.940
they're all

37:05.940 --> 37:07.900
you would

37:07.900 --> 37:08.220
think they

37:08.220 --> 37:08.640
were old

37:08.640 --> 37:09.100
people

37:09.100 --> 37:09.940
now

37:09.940 --> 37:10.400
you know

37:10.400 --> 37:10.820
they're like

37:10.820 --> 37:11.400
38

37:11.400 --> 37:12.380
39 years

37:12.380 --> 37:12.720
old

37:12.720 --> 37:14.520
but even

37:14.520 --> 37:15.020
now I

37:15.020 --> 37:15.320
mean I

37:15.320 --> 37:16.860
when I

37:16.860 --> 37:17.320
see that

37:17.320 --> 37:17.600
they're

37:17.600 --> 37:18.000
happy

37:18.000 --> 37:18.740
I'm

37:18.740 --> 37:19.080
happy

37:19.080 --> 37:19.560
my mother

37:19.560 --> 37:19.920
used to

37:19.920 --> 37:20.280
say that

37:20.280 --> 37:20.680
to me

37:20.680 --> 37:21.780
you know

37:21.780 --> 37:22.540
when I

37:22.540 --> 37:22.820
would do

37:22.820 --> 37:23.140
all the

37:23.140 --> 37:23.860
crazy things

37:23.860 --> 37:24.480
that I've

37:24.480 --> 37:24.900
done in

37:24.900 --> 37:25.340
my life

37:25.340 --> 37:26.000
like become

37:26.000 --> 37:26.280

37:26.280 --> 37:26.500
Buddhist

37:26.500 --> 37:27.180
my mother's

37:27.180 --> 37:27.640

37:27.640 --> 37:28.600

37:28.600 --> 37:29.060
I'm a Zen

37:29.060 --> 37:29.340
Buddhist

37:29.340 --> 37:29.800
monk

37:29.800 --> 37:31.100
and she

37:31.100 --> 37:31.680
said well

37:31.680 --> 37:32.280
what's a Zen

37:32.280 --> 37:32.560
Buddhist

37:32.560 --> 37:32.960
monk

37:32.960 --> 37:33.600
I said well

37:33.600 --> 37:33.940
you know

37:33.940 --> 37:34.380
it's this

37:34.380 --> 37:34.840
and that

37:34.840 --> 37:35.620

37:36.120 --> 37:37.620

they pay

37:37.980 --> 37:38.160
you

37:38.160 --> 37:38.640
nothing

37:38.640 --> 37:39.480
where do

37:39.480 --> 37:39.580
you

37:39.580 --> 37:40.300
you know

37:40.300 --> 37:41.340
and she

37:41.340 --> 37:41.680
said

37:41.680 --> 37:42.140
and then

37:42.140 --> 37:42.660
it all

37:42.660 --> 37:43.120
would end

37:43.120 --> 37:43.400
with

37:43.400 --> 37:44.000
well

37:44.000 --> 37:45.380
if it

37:45.380 --> 37:45.800

37:49.840 --> 37:50.360
really meant

37:50.360 --> 37:51.360
it

37:51.360 --> 37:51.900
you know

37:51.900 --> 37:53.420
so

37:53.420 --> 37:54.000
that's the

37:54.000 --> 37:54.520
way parents

37:54.520 --> 37:54.860
are

37:54.860 --> 37:55.960
pretty weird

37:55.960 --> 37:56.780
you'll find

37:56.780 --> 37:57.280
out one of

37:57.280 --> 37:57.840
these days

37:57.840 --> 37:58.860

37:58.860 --> 38:00.360
thank you

38:00.360 --> 38:01.040
oh go ahead

38:01.040 --> 38:01.680
one more

38:01.680 --> 38:05.520
really

38:05.520 --> 38:08.040
63

38:08.040 --> 38:09.800
for

38:09.800 --> 38:11.000
make believe

38:11.000 --> 38:11.600
I have

38:11.600 --> 38:12.420
another age

38:12.420 --> 38:13.620
65

38:13.620 --> 38:15.480
my 65

38:15.480 --> 38:16.940
age

38:16.940 --> 38:17.560
is the one

38:17.560 --> 38:17.820
that

38:17.820 --> 38:19.000
technically

38:19.000 --> 38:19.720
I am

38:19.720 --> 38:20.360
that

38:20.360 --> 38:20.920
is

38:20.920 --> 38:21.420
I'm a

38:21.420 --> 38:21.940
Pisces

38:21.940 --> 38:22.800
I was born

38:22.800 --> 38:23.260
in February

38:23.260 --> 38:24.240
26

38:24.240 --> 38:24.880
1930

38:24.880 --> 38:27.400
but my

38:27.400 --> 38:28.040
real age

38:28.040 --> 38:28.500
I'm a

38:28.500 --> 38:28.840
Gemini

38:28.840 --> 38:30.200
and I

38:30.200 --> 38:30.600
was born

38:30.600 --> 38:31.560
in 1931

38:31.560 --> 38:33.380
so

38:33.380 --> 38:34.380
I have

38:34.380 --> 38:35.020
two ages

38:35.020 --> 38:38.820
I think

38:38.820 --> 38:39.160
so

38:39.160 --> 38:40.560
as far

38:40.560 --> 38:40.860
as I'm

38:40.860 --> 38:41.240
