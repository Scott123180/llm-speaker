30000	34000	Koans of the Way of Reality, Case 108.
36000	40000	The Great Pearls, Dana, Prologue.
40000	46000	Giving generously means non-greed, not withholding.
46000	52000	One phrase, one verse, the ten thousand things, the hundred grasses.
52000	60000	One Dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors.
60000	66000	Since the beginningless beginning, there has never been a single thing to withhold.
66000	72000	When the Way is relinquished to the Way, the Way is realized.
72000	78000	When the Way is realized, the Way is manifested through itself.
78000	88000	When the self gives the self simply for the sake of giving, the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.
88000	98000	The cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth.
98000	100000	How can this truth be realized?
100000	102000	How can this truth be realized?
102000	104000	Listen to this old teaching.
104000	106000	The main case.
106000	112000	A monk asked the Great Pearl.
112000	116000	By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?
116000	122000	By means of Dhanaparamita, the Great Pearl said.
122000	130000	According to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path comprises six Paramitas.
130000	136000	Why then have you mentioned only one?
136000	138000	The Great Pearl said.
138000	146000	Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita.
146000	152000	And that by its practice, all the others are fulfilled.
152000	158000	The monk said, why is it called Dhanaparamita?
158000	162000	The teacher said, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.
162000	166000	The monk asked, relinquishment of what?
166000	171000	The teacher answered, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.
171000	186000	It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure.
186000	194000	By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.
194000	199000	The capping, capping verse.
199000	203000	You may understand it, but in vain.
203000	206000	You may believe it, but it's to no avail.
206000	213000	You may describe it, but it still remains a description.
213000	216000	Ultimately, how is it?
216000	222000	The river doesn't understand, yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean.
222000	227000	The mountain has no words, yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things.
227000	234000	It is here that the sweet innocence of Dhanaparamita is revealed.
234000	251000	As most of you, as I look around the room, I realize that most of you have been here for the weekend, so you were part of the whole Dhanaparamita thing yesterday.
251000	270000	But there are also some that weren't here, so some of what I did as opening remarks to the Dhanaparamita, or the Perfection of Giving weekend, I'd like to repeat so that it's clear to everyone.
270000	282000	Dhana, we translate, for those of you that are new to the term, as giving.
282000	285000	Although giving doesn't quite reach it.
285000	290000	It's more than just something going from A to B.
290000	296000	It's the same as in the transmission of the Dharma.
296000	308000	We call it Dhanaparamita, and paramita means the practice of perfection, or crossing over to the other shore.
308000	313000	And these paramitas are part of Mahayana Buddhism.
313000	328000	And in Zen, we understand the crossing over to the other shore as either the other shore and this shore are the same, or rather the other shore arrives.
328000	341000	So, Dhanaparamita is understood loosely as the perfection of giving.
341000	351000	And as all of you must have realized yesterday in the process of doing that weekend,
351000	360000	that the teachers of this weekend were really the people that arrived on the buses.
360000	376000	You'd have to be totally blind and without any sensibility at all not to have received an incredible amount of teaching from our guests the weekend.
376000	381000	And that's at the heart of what Dhana is about.
381000	386000	There can be no Dhana unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.
386000	388000	That's the heart of Dhana.
388000	390000	It goes both ways.
390000	393000	It must go both ways.
393000	401000	There can be no Dhana unless the giver and the receiver are unified, or become one reality in the process.
401000	405000	So, therefore, Dhana is not charity.
405000	407000	It's not generosity.
407000	420000	It's not almsgiving, or donation, or beneficence, or benevolence, or benefaction, or contribution, gift, philanthropy, offering.
420000	424000	Dhana is the practice of total relinquishment.
424000	425000	Relinquishment.
425000	430000	And that's what the great pearl was talking about.
430000	432000	Total relinquishment.
432000	433000	Letting go.
433000	436000	Not holding on to anything.
436000	439000	All the dualities must dissolve.
439000	449000	And needless to say, when all the dualities dissolve, each of those paramitas, each of the six paramitas are there.
449000	461000	Dhana, or giving, or the perfection of giving, is found throughout the Mahayana literature.
461000	463000	It appears in the precepts.
463000	468000	For example, be generous, do not be withholding.
468000	470000	That's Dhana.
470000	477000	It appears in the eight awarenesses of an enlightened person, the 52 aspects of a bodhisattva.
477000	482000	It appears in the paramitas.
482000	491000	It appears as part of the morality, the three basic teachings of the Buddha, one of which was morality.
491000	498000	So it's obviously considered by Buddhists to be one of the most important virtues.
498000	501000	It is the characteristic of a bodhisattva.
501000	506000	It's the life of a bodhisattva.
506000	511000	And in the prologue it says, giving generously means non-greed.
511000	515000	And if you really look at greed, you realize that greed is exactly the opposite.
515000	518000	Greed is about holding on.
518000	529000	And dhana is about letting go, not withholding, not holding back.
529000	535000	And then the prologue says, one phrase, one verse, ten thousand things, the hundred grasses,
535000	541000	one dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors, since the beginning.
541000	546000	There has never been a single thing to withhold.
546000	550000	So that's the ultimate truth that underlies the whole thing.
550000	555000	We may proceed through the world with an illusion of separateness,
555000	559000	with the illusion that the self and other are separate things.
559000	564000	But the fact is, there is no separation to begin with.
564000	570000	That's why we call dharma, the ten thousand things, purity itself.
570000	572000	There's nothing extraneous.
572000	574000	There's no outside.
574000	578000	It's all unified, whether we've realized it or not.
578000	585000	If we haven't realized it and we proceed on the assumption that there's a self and other separation,
585000	588000	then we run into all kinds of difficulties.
588000	591000	That's what the pain and suffering of this life is about.
591000	593000	That's what we call samsara.
593000	598000	So, if you haven't realized it, although it's true,
598000	601000	you're not going in accord with that realization.
601000	607000	When you realize it or when you practice in accord with the truth of that unity,
607000	611000	then it's a whole different way of living your life.
611000	621000	There has never been a single thing to withhold.
621000	628000	Because each one of us, this very body and mind, your very body and mind,
628000	632000	is the body and mind of the universe.
632000	634000	Where would you hold it?
634000	636000	And who would you give it to?
636000	643000	And then the prologue says, when the way is relinquished to the way,
643000	649000	when you give the way to the way, the Tao, to the Tao,
649000	654000	the way is realized.
655000	659000	When the way is realized, the way is manifested through itself.
659000	665000	So, the way begins to manifest itself through itself when you've realized the way.
665000	667000	What does it mean to have realized the way?
667000	669000	It means to have unified with the way.
669000	674000	When you are the way itself, the way manifests through itself,
674000	678000	which is none other than manifesting through you.
681000	683000	And that's what the next line means.
683000	687000	When the self gives the self simply for the sake of giving,
687000	690000	the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.
690000	693000	Again, that's about unification, no separation.
693000	697000	There's no reason for it.
697000	700000	There's no merit attached to it.
700000	705000	It's simply the way the universe is.
705000	712000	And so, the giving is simply for the sake of giving, for no other reason.
712000	719000	You can wash the dishes in order to have clean dishes.
719000	720000	That makes it functional.
720000	721000	There's a purpose.
721000	723000	There's a process.
723000	725000	And there's a result.
725000	728000	Or, you can wash the dishes to wash the dishes.
728000	733000	Just for the simple sake of washing the dishes.
733000	746000	So, the cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heaven and encompasses the earth.
746000	750000	That is, it is the nature of things.
750000	754000	Whether we've realized it for ourselves or not.
754000	761000	It's the nature of things.
761000	767000	So, this monk, in the main case, comes up to the great pearl.
767000	781000	And the great pearl is the successor of Matsu, the great master Basa, who had 84 enlightened disciples that he transmitted to.
781000	786000	Wei Hai is one of those disciples.
786000	796000	His name in Japanese is Daishu.
796000	798000	Daishu means great pearl.
798000	799000	Ikai.
803000	808000	He got the name great pearl because he first began studying with...
808000	811000	He was first ordained by another teacher.
811000	815000	And then went to study with Matsu and studied with him for a while.
815000	816000	And then the...
816000	819000	His first teacher became very ill.
819000	823000	And so, he left Matsu and went back to take care of his old teacher.
823000	829000	And while he was back there, he wrote a discourse.
829000	836000	And I'm trying to remember what that discourse was.
836000	842000	I guess it was a discourse on sudden elimination.
842000	852000	And a monk who was there took that treatise to Matsu.
852000	859000	And when Matsu read it, he said, there is a great pearl on that mountain.
859000	868000	And although he had the name Ikai, it was the name Daishu or great pearl that kind of stuck with him.
868000	874000	So, this monk asked the great pearl, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?
874000	881000	And he answered, by means of Dhanaparamita.
881000	889000	And this koan is not a koan in the usual sense of the word.
889000	892000	It tends to be very explanatory.
892000	903000	And I think the reason is that it arose from a mundo rather than a dharmakambat, shosan.
903000	910000	Dharma combats tend to be more direct pointing, more head squeezing.
910000	913000	Mondos tend to be intellectual and explanatory.
913000	915000	And this is kind of intellectual and explanatory.
915000	928000	But it has some value because of his particular way of expressing it that I thought was important for us to use and to treat it as a koan.
928000	932000	So, he says, by means of Dhanaparamita.
932000	937000	So, the monk said, according to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas.
937000	941000	Why then have you mentioned only one?
941000	950000	And the great pearl said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita.
950000	957000	And it's by the practice, by its practice, the practice of giving, that all the others are fulfilled.
957000	961000	And in a sense, you can say that for any of the paramitas.
961000	964000	You can say that for any of the precepts.
964000	968000	You can say that for the eight gates of Zen.
968000	973000	That in each one of them, the other are contained.
973000	977000	And if you realize any one of them fully, you've realized that.
977000	980000	In fact, you can say that of any koan.
980000	985000	That if you exhaust the koan completely, thoroughly,
985000	1002000	all of the ramifications and permutations and combination of a single koan, you've realized all of the koans.
1002000	1005000	And then the monk says, why is it called Dhanaparamita?
1005000	1010000	And he answers, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.
1010000	1013000	Relinquishment of what?
1013000	1016000	Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.
1016000	1023000	It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad.
1023000	1025000	The being and non-being.
1025000	1026000	Love and aversion.
1026000	1027000	Void and non-void.
1027000	1029000	Concentration and distraction.
1029000	1031000	Pure and impure.
1031000	1037000	By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.
1037000	1044000	Now, we've talked about this a hundred thousand times in the fifteen years we've been here.
1044000	1051000	You know, these dual, these so-called opposites.
1051000	1057000	That every one of them are two parts of the same reality.
1057000	1062000	That because they are mutually arising,
1062000	1067000	because they're codependent, that is, one cannot exist without the other,
1067000	1074000	we can choose to see them as opposite, but we can also see them as codependent, mutually arising.
1074000	1076000	You can't have one without the other.
1076000	1078000	You can't have good without bad.
1078000	1080000	You can't have being without non-being.
1080000	1083000	You can't have love without aversion.
1083000	1086000	Or form without emptiness.
1086000	1088000	They're mutually arising.
1088000	1090000	It doesn't make sense, one of them.
1090000	1092000	Heads and tails are two parts of the same coin.
1092000	1095000	You can't have a coin that says heads.
1095000	1101000	So, it's because of the difference that they can arise.
1101000	1107000	So, we can understand them as two separate things, a la the differences,
1107000	1111000	or, because of their codependency, the same thing.
1111000	1114000	That's what the gashow is.
1114000	1119000	When we gashow and bring together the palms and bow to each other,
1119000	1124000	we're acknowledging the unity of these two things becoming one thing.
1124000	1127000	That's what the bow also is.
1127000	1133000	We bow to the sugar, and we bow to the shower, and we bow to each other,
1133000	1137000	and before entering a room, and all of that precedes that action.
1137000	1150000	All of that acknowledges that the action is, in reality, one thing, not two.
1150000	1154000	Now, that being the case, and I've talked about this before,
1154000	1159000	our tendency is we get caught up in that duality,
1159000	1166000	and we want to move away from the thing that's not good to the thing that's good.
1166000	1170000	We want to get rid of evil altogether and just have good.
1170000	1174000	We want to get rid of sickness and just have health.
1174000	1177000	We want to get rid of old age and just have young age.
1177000	1183000	We want to get rid of bad and have good.
1183000	1187000	We want to move away from one and go toward the other.
1187000	1203000	And we've built a society and a technology, a multi-trillion dollar business of selling to the people,
1203000	1206000	getting rid of one and going to the other.
1206000	1209000	You know, take this and you'll be healthy.
1209000	1211000	Take this and you'll stay young forever.
1211000	1213000	Take this and everybody will love you.
1213000	1215000	Nobody will hate you.
1215000	1219000	But, of course, there's no way that you can do that.
1219000	1227000	There's no way that you can get rid of one and have only the other.
1227000	1230000	They're two parts of the same reality.
1230000	1237000	So, ultimately, what the whole thing comes down to, as I've mentioned before,
1237000	1244000	is not so much a matter of annihilating one side and having the other side,
1244000	1250000	but rather a process of navigation or what we call the middle way.
1250000	1255000	It's the same way that you take a canoe down a river.
1255000	1262000	The river is filled with all kinds of obstructions, rocks, bad, freeway, good.
1262000	1266000	So, I want the freeway and I want to hit the rocks.
1266000	1270000	And so you learn to navigate the river.
1270000	1276000	But rivers have a characteristic of changing constantly.
1276000	1280000	I mean, look at the map of any river that's two years old
1280000	1283000	and then check out that river and you'll find that it's a very different river.
1283000	1285000	Every spring, it becomes a new river.
1287000	1291000	Its bends and twists and turns and so on
1291000	1295000	happen in accord with the amount of rain and the terrain and so on.
1295000	1297000	So, it's hard to make a map for it,
1297000	1300000	just like it's hard to make a map for how to live your life.
1301000	1305000	So, in order to navigate a river, you need to learn to read the river.
1305000	1314000	You need to know how to manage the equipment, the canoe.
1316000	1320000	More importantly, you need to be one with that canoe.
1320000	1325000	You need to respond to the river like a canoe responds to the river.
1325000	1332000	And you need to be very alert, aware, very conscious, very centered,
1332000	1335000	with single-pointedness of mind.
1335000	1337000	You get distracted just for a minute, you know.
1337000	1341000	You examine your fingernails and you've hit something, turned over.
1341000	1344000	All your equipment is now being carried down the river.
1344000	1349000	So, you need to be there, but without tension.
1349000	1351000	If you do it with a lot of tension,
1352000	1357000	it's okay if you're doing, you know, a mile of whitewater.
1357000	1359000	But if you're doing ten miles of whitewater,
1359000	1362000	you'll get so exhausted by the time you've gotten halfway through it
1363000	1368000	that you begin to lose all of that awareness and focus and so on.
1368000	1373000	So, you need to be able to do it without exhausting yourself.
1373000	1377000	And all of that is a perfect metaphor for life.
1377000	1379000	How to live one's life.
1379000	1382000	How to discern the middle way.
1382000	1388000	How to be able to navigate and respond to circumstances as they come up.
1388000	1391000	There's no warning ahead of time, you know.
1391000	1395000	There's no map in the world that's going to show you that, overnight,
1395000	1398000	a tree has just fallen across the river.
1399000	1403000	And you're coming down at a goodly clip.
1403000	1406000	The river is carrying you full speed.
1406000	1408000	And you come around this bend.
1408000	1409000	And there you are.
1409000	1411000	There's no passage.
1411000	1413000	There's a tree that's completely covering.
1413000	1416000	And its branches are hanging down like this.
1416000	1420000	And you have to respond.
1420000	1422000	What do you do?
1422000	1424000	It's kind of interesting.
1428000	1429000	And it happens.
1430000	1432000	All the time.
1432000	1435000	So, it's the same with our life.
1435000	1438000	There's no way to predict what's around the next bend.
1438000	1443000	There's no way to predict what the next barrier will be that we encounter.
1443000	1449000	So, all we can do is develop the skills for working with the barriers that come up.
1449000	1451000	And that's what practice is.
1451000	1453000	That's all it is.
1454000	1462000	Those skills are based on an underlying realization of the nature of things, of the nature of the self.
1462000	1471000	So, all the things we talk about are explanations of what the underlying truth is that can be realized.
1471000	1474000	And when you realize it, the explanations are useless.
1474000	1476000	The precepts are useless.
1476000	1481000	All the paramitas are useless because they become a manifestation of your own life.
1481000	1486000	You don't need that kind of explanation anymore.
1486000	1491000	You spontaneously respond in accord with things.
1495000	1498000	Relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.
1499000	1505000	I added some footnotes to this, starting off with a question that the monk asked.
1505000	1508000	By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?
1508000	1511000	The footnote says, what gate?
1511000	1512000	Where is he?
1512000	1513000	What's he saying?
1513000	1515000	Where is there a gate?
1515000	1525000	A gate means that there's some place that's inside the gate and outside the gate.
1525000	1531000	It's like when Nansen said the Tao is not an outside thing.
1531000	1536000	Joshua comes up and says, well, what's the, what is the, it's not an outside thing.
1536000	1539000	So what's the Tao, what is the Tao of outside things?
1540000	1545000	If the Tao is not an outside thing, then there must be another Tao.
1547000	1550000	And of course, Nansen knew that.
1551000	1555000	And as well as Joshua knew that.
1555000	1557000	There's no inside and outside.
1557000	1559000	There's no point of entry.
1559000	1561000	It reaches everywhere.
1563000	1566000	So right off, you can see where this monk is coming from.
1569000	1574000	And the great pearl was being very, he may have known something about this monk.
1574000	1578000	Maybe the monk was at a point in his practice where he needed explanations.
1582000	1585000	But somebody comes, come looking for a gate.
1585000	1590000	I would approach very differently.
1591000	1594000	The next question, the next statement.
1594000	1597000	He says, by means of Dhanaparamita.
1598000	1602000	The footnote says, unavoidably, this will lead to more doubt.
1604000	1605000	More questions.
1605000	1606000	And still, he must respond.
1606000	1615000	And then the monk says, according to the Buddha, the Bodhisattva path has six paramitas.
1615000	1616000	Why do you mention only one?
1617000	1619000	Footnote says, this one alone?
1619000	1620000	What's he talking about?
1620000	1621000	What's he talking about?
1621000	1622000	One.
1622000	1634000	And then the great pearl says, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dana.
1634000	1637000	And that by its practice, all the others are fulfilled.
1639000	1641000	The footnote says, what's the old man doing?
1641000	1643000	Don't create complications.
1644000	1650000	The more he feeds this guy words, the more the guy produces words.
1653000	1654000	Why is it called Dana?
1655000	1657000	Footnote says, be generous.
1657000	1658000	Give him the stick.
1658000	1659000	Drive him out.
1663000	1665000	Dana means relinquishment.
1666000	1667000	The master answers.
1667000	1670000	Where is this going, the footnote says.
1670000	1672000	Let's see some relinquishment.
1674000	1676000	The next line, relinquishment of what?
1677000	1679000	Footnote says, everything.
1679000	1680000	Shut up and sit.
1685000	1692000	But the master, being very compassionate and grandmotherly, says, relinquishment of the dualism of opposites.
1693000	1695000	Footnote says, too bad.
1695000	1698000	He's up to his nostrils in mud.
1700000	1705000	And the monk says, what does that mean?
1706000	1719000	And the old man says, it means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure.
1719000	1726000	By giving up all of them, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.
1726000	1731000	Footnote says, I think he's drowned this monk with his words.
1732000	1733000	But say, did the monk get it?
1734000	1735000	Do you get it?
1735000	1747000	Basically, what he's talking about when he says relinquishment of all things is letting go.
1747000	1748000	Letting go.
1748000	1751000	And letting go, you know, comes up again and again.
1751000	1753000	We talk about it endlessly.
1753000	1761000	It's definitely part of the whole new age vernacular and everybody says it.
1761000	1762000	But what does it really mean?
1762000	1769000	Usually what it means when people hear the word non-attachment, they simply conclude it means not caring.
1771000	1773000	Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.
1774000	1776000	They think it means not loving, not caring.
1776000	1789000	All the way back into the 50s, that was the way the beat zen expressed itself.
1789000	1790000	I don't know.
1790000	1791000	I don't care.
1791000	1792000	And it doesn't matter anyway.
1792000	1797000	That was the, you know, the three truths of beat zen.
1797000	1804000	Well, you know, the only, only people that don't do zazen can make statements like that with red books.
1808000	1811000	Of course, we care.
1814000	1816000	And of course, it matters.
1817000	1821000	Not attachment doesn't mean not caring and not loving.
1821000	1824000	It means caring very much and loving very much.
1824000	1830000	You can't really love unless there is non-attachment.
1830000	1834000	So long as there's attachment, what you have is two things.
1835000	1841000	By the very nature of attachment, you have to have the attachee and the attachor.
1843000	1844000	That's two.
1845000	1849000	When these two merge, there can no longer be attachment.
1850000	1852000	There's nothing to attach to and no one to do the attaching.
1852000	1854000	That's what love is.
1855000	1856000	No separation.
1857000	1858000	That's what caring is.
1858000	1859000	No separation.
1859000	1860000	That's what dana is.
1860000	1861000	No separation.
1862000	1864000	That's what realization is.
1864000	1865000	No separation.
1867000	1871000	Whether we're talking about people or sound or form.
1871000	1872000	Form.
1872000	1876000	That's what Dogen meant when he said seeing form with the whole body and mind.
1877000	1878000	One understands it intimately.
1879000	1882000	Hearing sound with the whole body and mind.
1882000	1884000	One understands it intimately.
1884000	1886000	That intimacy is realization.
1887000	1888000	It's unity.
1888000	1889000	It's one thing.
1889000	1902000	So we call it letting go, non-attachment, forget the self, empty the mind, no mind, non-dual dharma, merging of differences.
1903000	1904000	Wonderful.
1904000	1907000	But how do you get there?
1907000	1920000	Well, you know, you can recite it in your head a hundred thousand times and try desperately to do it.
1920000	1923000	And, you know, you can do it.
1923000	1927000	You know, empathy is a kind of a practice in that direction.
1927000	1931000	But keep in mind, empathy with someone is still separation.
1933000	1935000	It's not yet unity.
1935000	1936000	Unity.
1939000	1942000	That's the difference between doing good and compassion.
1943000	1946000	In doing good, there's still separation.
1946000	1951000	In compassion, there's no sense of doer or the person that's being done.
1952000	1953000	Self and other.
1954000	1955000	Or act of doing.
1955000	1956000	It just happens.
1957000	1958000	Spontaneously.
1960000	1963000	The way the spring breeze warms the earth.
1963000	1965000	It doesn't know what it's doing.
1965000	1967000	The earth doesn't know about the spring breeze.
1971000	1972000	So how do we do it?
1973000	1977000	Well, no matter how you cut it in this practice,
1978000	1980000	no matter where you look to it,
1981000	1982000	no matter what the teachings are,
1983000	1987000	if we're talking about liturgy or the precepts or art practice, body practice, koans,
1987000	1995000	whatever it is, it all comes down to the old furnace of zazen.
1998000	2002000	The process of falling away of body and mind.
2003000	2006000	And we begin that process by working with the body,
2007000	2008000	and then with the breath,
2009000	2010000	and then the mind.
2012000	2014000	And as the process gets deeper,
2016000	2019000	and the body falls away,
2020000	2021000	off sensation of the body.
2025000	2026000	Mind is still functioning.
2026000	2027000	You know you're there.
2027000	2028000	You're watching the breath.
2029000	2030000	You're feeling the breath.
2031000	2033000	And then you disappear into the breath.
2034000	2036000	The breath is just breathing itself.
2037000	2038000	There's no longer an observer watching.
2042000	2043000	Mind falls away.
2046000	2047000	That's what Dogen meant
2048000	2049000	in that little,
2050000	2053000	those few little lines that encompasses the totality of our practice.
2054000	2056000	To study the Buddha way is to study the self.
2056000	2060000	You start with all the stuff.
2061000	2064000	All the stuff that we call our self.
2065000	2067000	The bag of skin.
2069000	2070000	Everything inside it is me,
2071000	2073000	and everything outside it is the rest of the universe.
2074000	2075000	That's the illusion.
2076000	2077000	And we start with that illusion.
2078000	2079000	And study it.
2080000	2081000	And layer by layer,
2082000	2083000	we begin digging at it.
2083000	2086000	The layers of conditioning.
2087000	2088000	Conditioning of parents,
2089000	2090000	teachers,
2090000	2091000	culture,
2091000	2092000	education,
2092000	2093000	peers.
2094000	2095000	Conditioning that began at birth,
2096000	2097000	and has continued through our life,
2098000	2099000	and is constantly reinforced,
2100000	2101000	day after day,
2102000	2103000	by our media,
2104000	2105000	and our literature,
2105000	2106000	and our politics,
2106000	2107000	and sociology,
2107000	2108000	and science,
2108000	2109000	and religion.
2109000	2112000	constantly reinforces the illusion of separateness,
2112000	2113000	of two things.
2116000	2117000	And we work with that.
2118000	2119000	Layer by layer,
2119000	2121000	examining it and letting it go.
2123000	2125000	Until we get to that ground of being.
2125000	2129000	We learn the practice of letting go,
2130000	2131000	moment to moment,
2131000	2132000	in zazen.
2132000	2133000	That's why it's so critical.
2133000	2134000	Seems simple, you know.
2134000	2135000	Thought comes up,
2135000	2136000	let it go,
2136000	2137000	come back to the breath.
2138000	2139000	Well,
2139000	2141000	what you're learning is how to let go.
2142000	2144000	And there's nothing as sweet,
2144000	2146000	or as juicy as our own thoughts.
2146000	2147000	We love them.
2148000	2149000	We hang on to them.
2150000	2152000	All the beautiful fantasies,
2152000	2153000	all the beautiful ideas,
2153000	2156000	all the brilliant words.
2156000	2158000	It's hard to let go of them.
2162000	2166000	Non-attachment doesn't mean abandoning them.
2166000	2168000	It means not attaching,
2169000	2170000	not holding on.
2175000	2177000	And layer by layer, we let go.
2178000	2179000	We get to that ground of being.
2179000	2184000	So to study the self is to forget the self.
2184000	2188000	Once you get rid of all of the aggregates,
2189000	2191000	what is it that remains?
2195000	2197000	When the self is forgotten,
2198000	2200000	what is it that remains?
2200000	2205000	Dogen says it in the next line,
2205000	2211000	to forget the self is to realize the 10,000 dharmas.
2216000	2218000	When you forget the self,
2219000	2220000	what remains,
2221000	2222000	when there's no longer a self,
2222000	2224000	is the 10,000 dharmas,
2225000	2226000	is everything.
2227000	2228000	The whole universe.
2229000	2231000	But there's no longer a barrier between you and it.
2231000	2232000	You are it.
2233000	2234000	The skin bag
2235000	2238000	either has embraced the totality of it,
2238000	2239000	or has just disappeared.
2239000	2240000	However you look at it,
2240000	2241000	it doesn't matter.
2242000	2243000	There's the merging.
2243000	2244000	The merging is even extra.
2245000	2247000	There's the realization that there never was a separation.
2247000	2254000	And in each aspect of those eight stages of,
2255000	2256000	eight gates of practice,
2257000	2259000	that same thing is functioning.
2260000	2261000	Non-dual.
2262000	2264000	So in the face-to-face teaching,
2265000	2267000	no separation is at the heart of it.
2267000	2274000	In our academic study,
2274000	2276000	not attaching to the words.
2277000	2282000	Our tendency in academic study is to want to hold on to the words.
2286000	2288000	We need to read it,
2289000	2290000	hear it,
2290000	2291000	throw it away,
2291000	2292000	and keep going.
2293000	2294000	Even in practice,
2295000	2296000	we need to realize it,
2297000	2298000	throw it away,
2298000	2299000	and keep going.
2300000	2301000	Whatever it is.
2301000	2302000	And ultimately,
2302000	2303000	we come to the peak of the mountain.
2304000	2305000	Enlightenment.
2305000	2306000	Realize it,
2306000	2307000	throw it away,
2307000	2308000	and keep going.
2309000	2311000	If you hold on to anything,
2312000	2315000	you've created that dualism again.
2316000	2318000	So that's why we emphasize,
2318000	2321000	not only material things,
2321000	2322000	even spiritual things.
2322000	2323000	If you hold on to it,
2323000	2326000	you create an illusion of separateness,
2326000	2327000	and it's diluted.
2330000	2334000	Liturgy is also the process of giving.
2335000	2340000	We constantly give in liturgy our gratitude,
2341000	2343000	our appreciation for the teachings.
2343000	2345000	We receive the teachings,
2345000	2347000	we give the gratitude.
2350000	2354000	The precepts are another example of
2355000	2356000	that non-dual dharma,
2356000	2357000	no-self.
2358000	2360000	They're based on no-self.
2362000	2364000	They're based on no-self
2364000	2367000	and designed to function in the world of differences.
2368000	2369000	That's what I mean.
2369000	2370000	You can't,
2370000	2373000	you can't deny existence.
2374000	2375000	The Buddha way is beyond
2376000	2377000	being and non-being.
2377000	2379000	It doesn't fall into either side of it.
2384000	2385000	In art practice,
2385000	2386000	the same thing.
2387000	2388000	The brush paints itself.
2390000	2391000	Body practice,
2391000	2392000	the dance dances itself.
2392000	2395000	In all of these,
2395000	2397000	self is forgotten.
2399000	2403000	But one of the things that's going to be happening soon,
2404000	2409000	we're coming to our 15th anniversary,
2410000	2413000	and we've also just received notification recently
2413000	2418000	that the monastery building and its grounds
2418000	2422000	has been recognized by New York State
2423000	2427000	as a historical site.
2428000	2431000	And it's also been recognized nationally
2432000	2434000	as a national historic site.
2435000	2437000	And this will give us an opportunity
2438000	2445000	to do fundraising to restore this building,
2446000	2448000	to do a major restoration project
2449000	2451000	as well as other things that we need.
2452000	2454000	And so we'll be launching a capital campaign,
2455000	2456000	a major fund drive.
2457000	2458000	And I just want to say to the people
2459000	2460000	who are going to be doing this fund drive
2460000	2466000	that if it's going to be charity,
2467000	2469000	it's not going to work.
2470000	2471000	If it's going to be generosity,
2472000	2473000	it's not going to work.
2474000	2475000	Or beneficence,
2475000	2476000	or donation,
2476000	2477000	or contribution,
2477000	2478000	or gift,
2478000	2479000	or philanthropy,
2479000	2480000	it's not going to work.
2480000	2481000	The people
2482000	2483000	that will give
2484000	2486000	must also receive.
2487000	2489000	Otherwise, it's not dana.
2490000	2491000	Very important.
2492000	2493000	So the question is
2494000	2495000	to really make clear
2496000	2498000	both sides of that.
2500000	2502000	Form is emptiness.
2503000	2504000	Emptiness is form.
2505000	2507000	Form is exactly emptiness.
2508000	2509000	Emptiness exactly form.
2510000	2512000	That's the same with all dualities.
2515000	2516000	The capping verse.
2517000	2519000	You may understand it,
2520000	2521000	but it's all in vain.
2522000	2523000	You may believe it,
2524000	2526000	but it's to no avail.
2527000	2528000	You may describe it,
2528000	2530000	but it still remains a description.
2532000	2533000	Ultimately,
2534000	2535000	how is it?
2536000	2537000	The river doesn't understand,
2538000	2539000	and yet it knows how to give itself
2540000	2541000	to the great ocean.
2542000	2544000	The mountain has no words,
2545000	2546000	yet it gives birth
2546000	2547000	to the ten thousand things.
2548000	2550000	It is here
2551000	2553000	that the sweet innocence
2554000	2555000	of dana
2556000	2557000	is realized.
2561000	2563000	You see that in children,
2564000	2565000	that sweet innocence of giving.
2565000	2566000	and that's the way it should be.
2567000	2568000	That's the way it should be.
2569000	2570000	.
2571000	2572000	.
2572000	2573000	.
2573000	2574000	.
2575000	2576000	.
2577000	2578000	.
2578000	2579000	.
2579000	2581000	.
2581000	2583000	.
