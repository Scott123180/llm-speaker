Written by Tricycleâ€™s editor, Helen Tworkov, the book follows the\r\nmovement of Japanese Zen to the United States through portraits of Robert Aitken, Jakusho\r\nKwong, Bernard Glassman, Maurine Stuart, and Richard Baker. Zen in America was originally\r\npublished in 1988 by North Point Press and was reissued in the spring of 1994 by Kodansha America."
