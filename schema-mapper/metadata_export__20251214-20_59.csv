By Helen Tworkov | Spring 1994
This essay has been adapted for Tricycle from the afterword that has been added to the forthcoming
edition of Zen in America. Written by Tricycleâ€™s editor, Helen Tworkov, the book follows the
movement of Japanese Zen to the United States through portraits of Robert Aitken, Jakusho
Kwong, Bernard Glassman, Maurine Stuart, and Richard Baker. Zen in America was originally
published in 1988 by North Point Press and was reissued in the spring of 1994 by Kodansha America.","John Daido Loori","","","","","1994 Spring"

37865,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-08-30 12:59","BA65","32","Zen Mountain Monastery","What Limits Your Freedom?","","This is from the Transmission of the Light, the 32nd Zen ancestor, Daozhen.

Daozhen said to the Zen master Tsang San, “I beg your compassion. Please give me a way of liberation.” Tsang San said, “Who is binding you?” Daozhen said, “No one is binding me.” Tsang San said, “Then why seek liberation?” At these words, Daozhen was enlightened.

In Kazon's verse: “When mind is empty, pure knowledge has no right or wrong. Here I don’t know what there is to bind or free. Even if you distinguish the elements of body and mind, seeing, hearing, sound, and form are ultimately not another.”

So this collection is sort of presenting the Zen ancestors, beginning with the Buddha and then down to Ejo—Dogen’s, one of Dogen’s successors. And so Daozhen, this is very early in the Chan tradition. So Bodhidharma, Huike, Seng San who wrote the Faith Mind, and Daozhen—the fourth Chinese ancestor. So late 500s, early 600s, very early.

And, you know, all of the teachings that come down to us—the records of different masters and going back to the sutras of the Buddha—you know, with the distance of time and just seeing things in print and kind of getting so accustomed to that, you know, we can know that this comes down to us through people, practitioners in every generation, beginning with the Buddha. But to really think about that, you know, how here we are sitting sesshin, getting ready to do ango. We have our own Buddhist practice, our own meditation practice. We study these teachings. And that’s been happening for all of these centuries. Just people, human beings living in their own time, in their own iteration of samsara, and thinking, “This is it.” Seeking, looking for some sanity, some sense of how to go about it a different way.

I was reading an early, one of the original sutras earlier, Nanda—not Ananda, but Nanda—who was a cowherd, he tended somebody else’s cows. And the Buddha was once with some of his disciples teaching, and Nanda with his cows was sort of on the periphery just listening. And he was so taken by the Buddha’s teaching that once the Buddha finished, he said, “I hear your teachings. I want to enter the way. Please ordain me right now.” And he said, “Cowherd, take your cows and give them back to the owner.” And Nanda said, “They’ll find their own way. They’ll figure it out. They’ll get home.” He said, “No, take them back, give them to their owner, and then come back.” And that’s what he did. He took them back, came back and was ordained, and went on to become one of the Buddha’s realized disciples.

And I thought it was such an interesting... you know, the Buddha said, take care of this, finish this before you begin something. But to think of just wandering around—he was at work, right? Nanda was just at work. He’s just out tending the cows. He didn’t wake up planning to be a monk. He just overheard the Buddha. So you’re just wandering around and you bump into the Buddha. That happened back then.

So Daozhen comes to Tsang San and says, “I beg your compassion. Please give me a way of liberation. I seek enlightenment. I seek release.” And students, practitioners, I think, can be shy about being so forthright, as though it’s presumptuous or arrogant or conceited. But to want to seek freedom from presumption and arrogance and conceit—is that egoistic? It’s easy to feel like it’s unrealistic, out of reach, only for the few. But the Buddha didn’t teach that way. He taught everyone who came to him and asked for the Dharma. So they were asking because they were capable. They had the capacity not just to hear and not just put it into practice, but to realize themselves.

And so walking this Eightfold Path, this path of liberation, of non-attachment, of compassion, loving kindness—every step we take, every day of honest practice is walking that path. And in some way, without measure, we come closer. So we shouldn’t be afraid to aspire, to speak those words. If you feel shy, do it in the privacy of your own home to begin, do it at your altar. “As I enter into this day as a practitioner of the Dharma, may I awaken my mind. May I realize enlightenment.” Get used to that. But of course, that presupposes seeking that, wanting that, wanting to practice, wanting to engage in a path to be liberated.

Daozhen says, but liberated from what? Well, Daozhen says, “I am bound. Please give me a way of liberation. Liberate me from what constricts and confines and makes my life not its full.” And I suppose a person can go through their life and never ask that question, “What is binding me? Who is binding me?” While shining the light upon themselves, but always outwards, right? Because there’s always somebody to blame. There’s always something going on out there that is giving us headaches or worse—something, someone that’s not right, that is wrong, that’s making our lives more difficult.

Maezumi Roshi, as we’re entering into the sort of celebration time, our 45th anniversary—one of the reasons I wanted to focus on Genjokoan is because it was something that Daido Roshi dearly loved. It was something he taught us and brought into our training and teachings, and also because it helps to connect with our lineage. It was important to him. We’re going to use his commentary, and there’s a talk by Maezumi Roshi where he says, “Our life is usually so hectic that we can quite easily lose ourselves. Zazen is a wonderful opportunity to face yourself and closely study yourself. In a way, it’s almost a joke to have to find out who we are or to realize what our life is. Our life, this life, it’s already in realization. It is already manifesting. So what is there to look for? When we look for something, the Buddha calls this delusion. Unfortunately, this is what all of us do in one way or another.”

And then he talks about the koan where there’s a student who says to his teacher, “I want to peck from the inside. Would you please tap from the outside?” When an egg is ready to hatch, the chick inside pecks at the shell, and the mother hen senses it and taps on the outside. When it’s time, just a little tap on the outside breaks the shell, and the chick hatches. If the shell breaks too soon or too late, the chick dies. So the student says, “Please tap from the outside.” Then he asks, “What is the point of this koan?” Roshi says, and he says, “I’m ready. Please let me come out.” And then he asks, “Where’s the shell? Where’s the hindrance that keeps you from coming out? What is binding you?” He says, there’s an expression in Japanese: “Without a rope, people bind themselves.” Roshi says, “You yourself do not think you are completely free. So you practice trying to liberate yourself. But what is binding you? Look around you. Nothing is binding you. And yet something is binding you. ‘I’m ready to come out. Please let me come out.’”

And there is a kind of... Daido Roshi talked about this a lot. Tap, tap, peck, peck. And there's that—it is a kind of a description of something that happens in training, the teacher. But the true power, the door that needs to open, is always in the hands of the student. And so how to liberate this sense of being bound—that’s what we’re doing. We’re trying to liberate ourselves from a delusion, right? Not from an actual constriction, although there is constriction. But what we’re trying to free ourselves from is the sense of that constriction, the sense of our delusion, which is just showing us how powerful our mind is to create a sense of something that, in essence, can’t be found, has no essence, and yet sets us seeking and is at the root of all the human suffering.

And so the Buddha said, “See everything that is impermanent—in your eyes, in the objects that your eyes see, in your consciousness that is seeing. When your eyes touch an object, there’s a moment of contact and there’s a feeling, a sensation. You like what you see, you don’t like what you see, you’re indifferent.” He said, “See that each aspect is impermanent.” Why is that important? The Buddha said, when we see that clearly, we become disenchanted. When we realize there’s nothing there that's permanent, we become disenchanted.

He said, “See everything that is dependently arising—when the ears hear and consciousness knows the sound of what is being heard. And there is contact and there is feeling—liking, not liking, neutral.” The Buddha said, “See that in that, nothing has any self existence. Nothing happens on its own, is separate from seeing, from hearing, from consciousness.” And he presents these teachings and really meditations as paths of liberation. That when we see that, we become disenchanted. When we realize there’s no self-being, no own-being, that we realize that there’s no solidity to anything. So what are we grasping at? What is binding us?

There’s a... in the Therigatha, the collection of poems by nuns at the time of the Buddha, there’s one of the nuns, one of the verses is from Sisu Pacchala, who had a sister Chala, and another sister named Upachala. And the three sisters were all the younger sisters of Sariputra, who was one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha. We chant his name every morning—the Heart Sutra. So this is some family, right? So they all go to the Buddha and ordain. And the footnote on her says their parents were not happy. That’s going to lead them to also want to go ordain, or never want to go anywhere near. So in her poem, she says:

“The nun, filled with virtues, with the ways we know the world, well-controlled, attains the state of peace, sublime and sweet.” 

And then Mara, speaking to her, says, “Yeah, but you know, there are gods in the heavens, and they are creating pleasures unimaginable every day. Turn your mind to those pleasures. Don’t you want those pleasures? You used to enjoy them, and these are so much better.” 

And she says, “Yes, there are still these gods who create their own pleasures.” She says, “But all of them, day after day, life after life, in whatever body they come into being in, they will never get beyond this. They just turn and turn and turn—in birth and death, coming and going, trying to hold on to what they cannot have and ultimately losing. She said, “The whole world is in flames. The whole world is burning. The whole world is blazing. The whole world is shaking. The Buddha taught the Dharma that cannot be shaken. It has no equal and is not known by the untrained. But I have fixed my mind on it. After I heard what the Buddha said, I lived delighting in his teaching. I have seen this with my own eyes. What the Buddha taught is done. What you take, Mara, as pleasures are not for me anymore. The mass of mental darkness that I lived with for so long is split open. Know this, O Mara, you are defeated. You are finished. Defeated.”

As she knows her mind, as she is free of the enchantment of those pleasures. And the Buddha acknowledges in the sutras, he says, “Yes, they are pleasurable.” He doesn’t say, “They’re not.” He says, “No, they are. They are pleasurable and they’re impermanent.” And so that pleasure that we derive from them is pleasurable, right? But we can’t keep it. And so we will continually be disappointed when we invest in them more than they can give, when we seek from them some lasting, deeper, more ultimate sense of satisfaction or fulfillment.

The Dharma that cannot be shaken. Every mind-created idea or belief or philosophy or opinion can so easily be shaken. And then what do we have? You know, it’s the importance of faith in the Buddhist path that is based in, that is tethered, is dependent upon, is relying upon our practice. From within that, faith to verify that which we have faith in. That is a crucial aspect of Buddhist practice.

I remember years ago—it’s a long story, but I knew somebody—the wife of one of the Greenhaven students who also had been incarcerated for a very long time. And she was deeply religious. She was Christian, deeply religious. Her message on her voicemail, her answering machine back then, was a message of faith. It was a huge part of her life. And through various circumstances, her husband, the student at Greenhaven, who had just been released—actually was just to be released, and they had the rest of their lives before them, finally freed. And he died suddenly before he could even leave prison.

And I remember calling her and speaking with her afterwards and asking her how she was doing. And of course, she was in immense grief. And I said, “Is your faith helping you?” And she said, “What faith?” And that’s understandable, right? Her whole world has been shaken and some perhaps understanding that with this faith I will be, I don’t know what, in God’s grace, that if I live a pious life, then my life will be a mirror of that piety, that I will... gone, at least for the moment. I don’t know what happened over time, but for me, it was a really vivid example. I felt heartbroken really for her, because I knew how important, what a pillar that was for her. And I said to her, I said, “Look, I get this, but I really hope that this is going to change, you know, this will come back.” But for me, it was a really kind of... it got my attention because I thought, as strong and deep and righteous as that faith is, in a way, it can be precarious unless it’s bound up, right? It’s dependent upon something that I am doing that begins to, in a sense, not just verify, but in a sense, replace that faith with experience. So in a way, the faith that I have had, in a way transforms into experience, which then encourages me to have more faith. Faith isn’t something that we don’t yet know to be fully true. And so it seems that greed and stinginess, fear, anger, jealousy, indifference, deception are perennial, right? As long as human beings have been speaking about their world, we hear those records, we see that in the records, but also perennial is generosity and patience, kindness, moral clarity, commitment, devotion, respect, humility.

Sisu Pacchala said, “What you take for pleasures are no longer ultimate pleasures. I am no longer seeking through those pleasures.” So it doesn’t mean we cannot partake of those pleasures, but in a sense, as practitioners, partake of them knowingly. And the Buddha said this. He said, “Look, use food for what food is for. Don’t try and turn it into something it’s not. Don’t look for it, from it, to give us something it can’t give us. That will only lead to disappointment.” The mass of mental darkness is split open.

And so in sesshin, we create this very simple kind of bare landscape with the precautions and silence and eyes lowered, and no entertainment other than what you’re coming up with in your own mind. So we’re releasing much of those sort of ephemeral, temporary pleasures to create this bare landscape, this naked landscape, to make it easier for... for what? To see. To make it easier for us to see.

And so first, in order to do that, we use that bare landscape to not agitate the mind, right? So that our mind is not going out, out, out, out, out, and being excited or agitated or upset by what we’re experiencing. There’s just not much going on, so that there can be a great deal to see. And in that, as the Buddha said, we can begin to see more closely in a way that is more... changing. Impermanence, right? I mean, we all know everything is impermanent. That’s not that hard to know. Everything is in a constant state of change. Of course, we forget that all the time. We act as though it’s not true all the time. But the Buddha said, when we really understand impermanence, that will liberate your mind. So he’s talking about understanding impermanence at a deeper level, not just a conceptual understanding.

So Maezumi Roshi asked, “Well, what is binding you? Look around you.” He said, “Nothing is binding you, and yet something is binding you. Nothing is binding you. You are realizing yourself, manifesting yourself as you are. What is wrong with how you are? What is wrong with how you are?” He asks. Then he says, “You just can’t take it.” Take what? Who you are. He said, this is simply because something is obstructing us from seeing this fact, that there is nothing wrong, and we can’t—it’s hard to take that. There has to be something wrong. If there wasn’t something wrong, then why wouldn’t I...? I mean, if there’s nothing wrong, then why wouldn’t I already be enlightened? Why wouldn’t I be at peace? Why wouldn’t I be fully embodying the precepts? It’s just hard to take. He said this obstruction, whatever it is, makes us feel as if we are bound by something. The Buddha calls this delusion. In other words, your mind is not in the right place. Your mind is not in the right place.

Daozhen, right before he dies, said, “All things are liberated. You should keep mindful of this and manifest it in the future. All things are already liberated.” So he clearly went on to see that not only was he not bound, nothing was binding him, but there was nothing being bound in the whole universe. It’s said that after he died, which was just after he said this—he was 72—he was entombed on the mountain where he lived. And the next year, the door of the crypt where he was entombed opened of itself for no reason. And when they looked in, it looked like he was still alive. And so after that, they never shut the door of the tomb. He was posthumously named the Great Physician.

Zen Master Kazon in the commentary says, “The cultivation of emptiness is called the gate of liberation. Why neither sentience nor Buddhahood binds you—what more birth and death could there be to entangle you? This cannot be assessed through body or mind. It cannot be discerned by illusion or enlightenment. Even if you talk about mind or objects or afflictions, enlightenment—all of these are just different names for the self. Therefore, mountains and rivers have no barrier. Subject and object are not different. And because of this, when it’s cold, it chills you thoroughly. When it’s hot, it heats you thoroughly.”

Your sentience, our sentience, our Buddha nature, our Buddha mind does not bind us. Our body, our senses, our experiences, right? Of course, this is hard to take, right? Because it sure as hell seems like something is binding us. When a strong emotion, when something happens and we feel a strong reaction comes forth, then we get caught in—it gets entrenched, intractable. We suffer, we get sick, we act out. And so he says, “Nothing is binding you and something is binding you.” Both are true, and both are truths within Buddhist teachings, which means both are to be examined deeply.

So this means our humanity, our faults, our strengths, our weaknesses, our desires, our non-attachments, our attachments do not bind us. And pain and confusion, sense of constriction, anxiety, fear, and worry—they have a reality, right? Buddhism does not deny that. It does not say you are not experiencing that, that when you are sad, you are not sad. Buddhism doesn’t teach that, but it asks the question, “But what is this sadness? As I am bound by sadness or grief or anger—what is this sadness or grief or anger?” And so to look closely. And so Tsang San says, “Well, who is it that is binding you?” And Daozhen says, “No one is binding.” Maybe he answered that right in the moment, he knew already. Maybe he had to go away for a while and examine and look deeply within himself and ask that question. Maybe he’d never had that question presented to himself, so he really, he wanted to know. And he came back and he said, “No one is binding me.” “Then why seek liberation?” So what did he realize in that moment?

Kazon said, “When you cross this barrier, it’s not a principle of either/or. That is to say, there’s neither bondage nor liberation. There’s not this nor that. Things do not set up names. Things do not set up their own forms. Therefore, deliberate cultivation comes to an end.” In other words, we stop creating worlds within worlds and taking them as existing by themselves. So then the Bodhisattva of Compassion now goes about creating worlds—we’re in one right now—for the purpose, but knowingly, as a skillful means.

“When the mind is empty, pure knowledge has no right or wrong. When mind is empty,” he says, “here, I don’t know what there is to bind or free.” Where is this “here”? When all mental activity comes to rest, when there’s no sense of bondage or release. That’s why the Buddha said, “When you’re sitting, don’t sit and think, ‘I am sitting. I am holding on, I am letting go.’ Don’t keep imposing, injecting a created sense of self into a moment that does not have one and does not need one. Being free of that sense of self—now, what is binding?”

There’s an interesting sutra where the Buddha talks about the six senses, and he likens them to animals. So there’s a snake and an alligator and a bird and a dog and a jackal and a monkey. He’s just drawing from his neighborhood. And he says, so you take a rope, and you tie the rope around each one of these: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. And then you take the ends of those six ropes and you tie them into a knot. So now each of those animals is tethered to each other. And he said, they are going to pull and pull and pull and pull, because each one wants to go to its domain. The alligator wants to go into the water. The bird wants to fly. The monkey wants to go up in the trees. The snake wants to go into the grasses. So they’re all fighting to go to their place where they belong, where they gravitate, where they dwell. And he said, eventually they’ll tire themselves out, and the one that’s most powerful will dominate all the others. Interesting. And pull the others along.

So to think of that—which sense, right, finally wins out, and it tethers all the others coming along. He said, now if you take the same animals, tie them, but now you tie the ends of each of those ropes to just one stake. They pull just like they did before, but they’re not pulling against each other. They’re pulling against the stake, and the stake is holding them equally, and the stake isn’t fighting them back. When they’re tethered to each other, they’re fighting against each other. The stake isn’t fighting anybody. And finally, they get exhausted. And what the living things do when they get exhausted—they lay down and rest. He said, that stake is mindfulness. That’s what holds us. That’s what, in a sense, binds with, in a positive way, us to this moment freely. And the difference between the bondage that Daozhen is talking about is that is not given freely. That is a sense of something that is happening to me, even though I am doing, is born out of a lack of mindfulness.

And so it’s interesting just to use that as a way of thinking about, right, the role of mindfulness and holding, keeping us from just flying away. And that when finally we exhaust ourselves—well, part of sesshin is to get you exhausted. It’s pretty effective, wouldn’t you say? But exhausted in a good way—not worn out, you know, mentally, emotionally, but exhausted of our efforts to continually pull and try and get away from that stake. And so when we’re practicing mindfulness, we move towards it, right? The rope goes slack, but then we get distracted, we get excited, so we pull and it yanks at us. That’s our vow. That’s our intention.

Kazon says, “Even if you distinguish the elements of body and mind, seeing, hearing, sound, and form are not another. Seeing is seeing, hearing is hearing. Each complete within itself, each by itself free. The eyes do not bind. The object does not bind.” And so Kazon says, “You actually have a light called ‘vision of the world.’ You have a sense of taste called ‘blending six flavors.’ Therefore, you emanate this light everywhere and prepare a feast everywhere. As you savor it, you find rich flavor where there’s ultimately no flavor. As you observe it, you find true form where ultimately it’s empty of form. Thus, there are no rules, rulers, or politicians that you need to approach. There’s no physical or mental sitting or reclining that is going to give it to you. It’s all here. The feast is prepared, the table is set.”

And so we open the eyes, we open the ears, the tongue, the nose, skin, mind. And then in the moment where it seems like something, we ask, “Where is the hindrance? What is it that’s binding me?” And realize nothing is wrong with you. You can take it, and your mind is in exactly the right place.

Thank you for listening.

Some of you may know that we just finished Silent Illumination Retreat this morning. And even for those of you who weren't here for the retreat, you may find what I'm about to share, hopefully, a little useful.

Some of you who have been practicing may be wondering how we can take the practice that we've been engaging in—the practice of cultivating moment to moment, clear awareness of body and mind in this space here, a lot of time on the sitting meditation seat—how do we take that into our daily life? After all, we go home; we've got responsibilities at home, in the family, at work, and, of course, various ways of engaging in social, relationship, or other ways we engage in civic life as citizens, members of our community.

And this is when we will find guidance from what we recite often—the Four Great Bodhisattva Vows—helpful. Many of you may remember reciting it at various times, in various situations. In fact, I myself recite it every time before I start my sitting meditation practice. And you might want to try integrating it into your own practice. I also recite it at the end of my meals so that I won't forget. Some of you may remember reciting it here at the monastery.

The Four Great Bodhisattva Vows:
- Sentient beings are numberless. I vow to save them.
- Desires are inexhaustible. I vow to put an end to them.
- The dharmas are boundless. I vow to master them.
- The Buddha Way is unattainable. I vow to attain it.

And you may vaguely remember reciting this. Possibly you think that, well, this doesn't really apply to me. Surely it seems very sort of highfalutin or really advanced. It's maybe for the priest here to do, me, maybe not. And so maybe you're just kind of saying it without really paying much attention to it.

In fact, remembering these Four Great Bodhisattva Vows will be incredibly important for us, to remind us of the path so that we do not stray off in some strange directions. I just read you the translation used here at the monastery. I have been using, reciting on my own, a slightly different translation, and that's what I'll be using. And that translation is a literal translation of the four lines written in Chinese. You might notice some slight differences, but the general idea is the same.

The first vow—most important here in the liturgy book: ""Sentient beings are numberless. I vow to save them."" The character ""save"" that's being translated as ""save"" in the version that I recite myself, we recite as ""I vow to deliver innumerable sentient beings."" Save, deliver—what is that? Well, the word ""deliver"" is a literal translation from the character that intends to say, like, we want to bring sentient beings from the shore of suffering to the other shore.

Now, you might be like, ""I don't know that has anything to do with me because I am suffering. I really can't help the other people go to the other shore. Right?"" Well, actually, we can do it right now. What it really means is that we vow to bring benefits to sentient beings in what we do, how we live. That is very manageable. We can do that.

This is very important to keep in mind because it reminds us what it is that we are here to do—the motivation, right intention we need to cultivate for our practice. Oftentimes, I encounter practitioners who come to the practice, for example, a few years ago, she's a therapist at a college. She wanted to come to practice to endure seven days of leg pain so that she can better help the suffering beings she works with as a therapist at work. She can be more present with them and be able to support them.

Also, I encounter people who find that they're struggling as parents. They feel like they can't really connect with their children and they're not really doing a good job as parents, not able to have a harmonious relationship with their family members. And they want to practice to be able to be better parents. So these are really the motivations that are appropriate for bringing to the practice: ""I vow to deliver innumerable sentient beings.""

Here we are pointing to the fact that we are practicing in order to be able to bring benefits to sentient beings. Especially, it's easy to kind of forget. When we engage in a lot of meditation practice, after a while we forget what it's about and may kind of think that, ""Oh, this is about finding ways to gain meditative experience."" After a while, you think, ""What am I doing here? I'm trying to achieve this one-minded state. I'm trying to achieve that blissful experience so that I can tell people when they say, 'Hey, what are you doing? You're doing all the meditation retreats and what did you get?'"" You want to have something to show for it.

So after a while, if we forget this vow, we may go off in those directions. When we remember this vow—that I am engaging this practice so that I can bring benefits to sentient beings—then we can remember it is not about gaining meditative experience, it is not about some form of collecting meditative experience, some form of spiritual materialism. This will help us stay on the path.

Some of you may be kind of discouraged, put off by the part about ""sentient beings are numberless"" or ""innumerable sentient beings."" That feels very impossible—maybe a couple people, but innumerable sentient beings? How is that manageable? How is it possible? Am I just saying things, making vows that there's no hope of fulfilling?

Well, one way to understand ""innumerable sentient beings"" is to understand it as referring to everyone—everyone we encounter, everyone we have the opportunity to encounter, and also people who are affected by our actions. Then it becomes more manageable for us to consider our action and think about how, in this moment, I can bring benefits to others.

First off, we start with people who are close to us—our loved ones, our family members, our friends. Some of you may think, ""Well, how to bring benefit to them?"" In our culture, we're encouraged to show that you care about them by going shopping and buying more gifts for them. Oftentimes, that may not be what they need. And we already have what most people truly need and want—our full presence.

This morning in the sharing at the end of the retreat, one of the participants shared this very important insight: realizing that being fully present with someone really is a form of love. If you have been fortunate enough to be on the receiving end of it, you realize when someone is fully present with you, allows you to feel truly seen and heard, you feel loved by that person. And the reason why we notice it is because it's rare. Most people are so distracted, their minds so scattered, they often forget to be fully present with us.

So this is one way we can bring benefit to other sentient beings. This is the reason why we engage in the practice of cultivating moment to moment clear awareness. In the practice of Silent Illumination, we've been engaging in practice being fully present with ourselves, allowing thoughts and feelings to be fully felt and seen and heard. We engage in this practice to be fully present with ourselves so that we know how to be fully present with others, allowing others to feel felt and heard and seen, and thus loved.

Sometimes, when we try to put it into practice, we may notice some habits. Our most common entrenched habit is to take people in our life, especially our loved ones, for granted. In our mind, we think they're just there, almost like a piece of furniture. It's like a couch. ""Like my husband—yeah, he's just there."" So as a result, because we have fallen into this habit of taking our loved one for granted—they're always there for us—we allow ourselves to get in our mind that, ""I'm too busy. I'm too busy. I have all this stuff to do."" You have this long to-do list to get to.

At home, when our loved ones come home, we often forget to bother to notice, to pay attention, to be fully present with them. For example, maybe a loved one has been out at school or at work for a day and comes home. If we spend time to be present with them, we may be able to notice, ""Hmm, something is bothering him. Did something happen at work?"" And we're able to ask about it. Maybe you can't offer any solution for them, but they feel seen and felt and thus loved by us.

Oftentimes it only takes a minute. But in our mind, because we are so habituated to taking people in our life for granted, we tell ourselves, ""I'm too busy. By the way, I already know who that is. It's my husband."" Ignored, not really seeing him. So this is what we can do in bringing benefit to people in our life.

Actually, this reminds me of someone I spoke with recently in the last couple of months. She told me she's a homemaker and her husband works at home part of the week. And she said, ""Well, we spend all this time in the same house, but we rarely talk to each other."" And actually, when she travels to visit her mother in another country, that's when they talk a lot more. So this is kind of illustrating how we tend to get into the habit of just getting so busy with our stuff. And, of course, nowadays we sit there and start looking at our phone instead of paying attention to our loved ones right here in front of us.

Again, here I'm not talking about just, like, staring at the people at home and like, ""I'm paying you attention here."" They're kind of like, ""You're being weird, so I need to get going doing my stuff."" We're not talking about that, but actually, yeah, pay attention and spend time to be present with them so that you can see and feel what's going on. Because this is a new moment. This is a new moment of this person being here. Even though you may have been married to this person for 50 years, it's a new moment of this person being here.

So in our daily life, as we remember the vow of bringing benefits to sentient beings, then we can notice these habits of taking people for granted and not paying attention, and so we can release it and be here and present with them. It doesn't take much. In this way, we allow our loved one to feel seen and heard and loved.

Related to this, some people may be thinking, ""Oh, okay, this is what I'm here to do—to bring benefit to sentient beings."" And a lot of you may have been already doing that by trying to be helpful, like wanting to be someone who is helpful to others. Well, I'd like to invite you to use these moments to look into your mind to see if it is a habit. It is a habit that may inadvertently lead us to cause harm to others. Like, really wanting to help others can cause harm to others.

I had this student, she has this habit of wanting to always be helpful, wanting to always be helpful. In fact, for her, ""I have to be helpful. If I'm not helpful, something's wrong. I always have to be helpful."" That's her habit. One time in a retreat, this habit showed up and she went over to someone who was engaging in her task and started helping her. And this other retreat participant came to me and was very upset about what happened. There was a little bit of a conflict there.

And you wonder, what happened? Well, you know, because in her urge and compulsion of having to be helpful all the time, even when it is not needed, someone has been assigned to do this. And her urge, her compulsion of having to be helpful all the time, trying to help, barging in on another person assigned to do a task, made this person feel that you are saying she is doing a terrible job—""Let me help you."" And that's why she got quite upset. She meant well, but what happened was, inadvertently, by succumbing to this urge of having to be helpful all the time, which is a form of self-centered attachment, we inadvertently cause harm.

Afterwards, she talked to me, this retreatant told me, ""Yes, that is actually like a form of suffering for her. She always feels that she has to do this and it has to do with her sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem."" So when we cultivate moment to moment clear awareness, that allows us to notice that, oh, what's happening is not fulfilling the vow of benefiting sentient beings. Actually, what I'm doing is perpetuating this habit, this habitual reactivity, telling ourselves that I have to, I have to be helpful, be a certain way all the time, whether that is appropriate or needed or not.

So when we are able to notice this urge, ""I have to be helpful,"" and release it, that actually allows us to open our awareness, to see clearly, to see the present moment situation clearly, and actually be able to notice what is actually needed. And when you notice no one is doing it, maybe if I can, I can be the one doing this. Quite different from barging in, doing something that someone else is already doing and making that person feel inadequate, feel that you are telling them that they are doing a terrible job.

In fact, this is something that I learned from my root teacher, Master Sheng Yen. He often would teach us that when something needs to be done, but no one is doing it, ""Let me do it. Give that to me. Give that task to me."" So what he's pointing to is that oftentimes there are certain aspects, for example, running a monastery or certain aspects of a task that is difficult, very challenging. Oftentimes, no one's doing it because it's very difficult, but more often it's because it does not show results very quickly.

Most of us want to do something and see that we are succeeding quickly. It's like you may just do it, do it, and do it, but you don't really see results, and you may not even see a result before you die. So people don't want to do it. Or it's not something that is popular or not glamorous. It's not going to earn you recognition or fame or status, but it's needed, very much so. And that is what he is pointing to: when there's something that needs to be done and no one's doing it, ""Let me do it, let me do it."" And also, the things that others are already doing, it's already covered. Then there's not a need for me to also jump on it to add to that. Let me do something—do what is needed, but not currently being done.

Here I want to clarify: it's not about wanting to stand out as someone who's different just for the sake of being different. What I'm talking about is that we cultivate clear awareness of the whole situation, total clear awareness, so that we can recognize what is needed but is not being done, and also the willingness to let go of our desire or attachment to recognition and praise, status that come from what we do, and do what is needed, even though it is difficult and does not show results and earn us recognition.

In our dealing with loved ones in our life, sometimes we may find ourselves falling into a mode of operation because that's what we've been doing all our life without knowing, even though we are engaging in it with good intention. For example, recently I met a practitioner, a very sincere practitioner, naturally very generous, loving. She told me how her mother had a very hard life raising several children on her own, and now she is able to make a good living, and she wants to be able to show her love to her mother by showing her a good time, taking her traveling with her to enjoy life at this time.

And then she said, ""But I dread doing that, because in the previous time she took her mother traveling, first, her mother insisted on taking her cousin with her. And the whole time, her mother was only hanging out with her cousin. And apparently, her mother was overheard by the taxi driver badmouthing her with her cousin."" And she's like, ""I don't know if I can do this anymore.""

So, wow. Here is a situation: she wants to show her love, she wants to give her mother a good experience traveling, yet she ends up feeling rejected, very bitter, and very upset to the extent that she's just kind of taking time off from talking to her mother. Like, well, what to do, right? How to use the practice with that?

Here, when we engage in the practice of cultivating clear awareness of what's going on, we may notice—and this is what this practitioner did—notice that what's happening was that she's been attached to her idea of how her action of showing love should look like. ""I love my mother. I want to go travel with her, show her a good time by traveling, taking her travel with me,"" and imagine that we're going to go and have fun and enjoy each other. She had in her mind some other mother—not her mother—some other mother who loves traveling with her daughter.

Meanwhile, she wasn't able to see what her mother actually enjoys, actually wants at her age. Her mother wants to be able to spend time with someone her age, her own cousin, so that they get to do things; they have the same pace, you know, traveling. Recognizing that we have been attached to our assumption, our idea, believing that her mom should want to spend her dream vacation with her, recognizing that, ""Oh, actually, that's not what she wants,"" in the first moment can be a little painful. It's like it shatters your idea, maybe wanting to continue to be the center of your mother's universe. Happens to a lot of adult children. Not anymore. You're not five anymore. They want to have their own life now that you're growing up.

And when cultivating clarity about this, it allows her to see that, ""Ah, okay. What do I want? I want to show my love. I want her to be able to have an enjoyable trip. How about I pay for her and her cousin to go to London and I don't need to be there feeling rejected and criticized and also save money for my own share to go to London, because it wasn't enjoyable for me last time?""

So in our good intention of bringing benefits to our loved one, we can practice noticing these ideas we hold in our mind about our loved ones and instead really see who is here so that we can work with the person as they are now, not the person we wish them to be. Recognize we hold our idea of people in our mind and ignore the person who is actually here.

Now, some practitioners make this vow: ""I vow to deliver innumerable sentient beings,"" and these innumerable sentient beings, yes, ""I vow to bring benefit to all sentient beings—except me. I have been excluded from the sentient beings somehow, not me."" So we're willing to look after others generously, with kindness, but not ourselves.

Oftentimes, that shows up as ways where we perpetuate habits of harshness toward ourselves. Some of you may be able to recognize it in moments when we are feeling really quite exhausted, overwhelmed by all the work we have, and we wouldn't allow ourselves to take a break, just keep pushing on, you know: ""I'll just sleep less, skip meals, you know, just push on."" But we will, when someone is feeling kind—""Hey, you should go take a break""—but not me. Benefit everyone but ourselves.

Or related to that, the habit of only focusing on what we did not do well and ignoring, dismissing everything we managed to do actually quite well. It's like everything we are able to do—nothing, that's nothing. But this thing, you know, I didn't do well, it's a problem. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? Beat ourselves up. I don't know, it doesn't sound familiar to you? It's like some practitioners sit here in meditation: ""I feel drowsy."" Beat themselves up: ""What is wrong with me? Why can't I stop being drowsy?"" While the whole time, they didn't give up. They stayed and stayed and stayed and never gave up. Session after session, never gave up. Doing that is incredible. Yet we dismiss that, refuse to recognize that.

So the practice of cultivating total open, clear awareness is about recognizing that. Because if we refuse to recognize what we are able to do—in this case, we didn't give up, we stayed—then what happens is we end up feeling despair, like a failure. And that can compel us to engage in other actions such as, ""Oh, I feel like such a failure. I want to avoid other people."" And then we kind of just become more and more isolated from others and turn our life into a ball of suffering.

So this is an example of when we allow the habits of harshness on ourselves to be perpetuated, then what happens is we become so consumed by suffering that we deprive the world of our presence. We withdraw ourselves, feeling like such a failure. We deprive the world of our presence, deprive the world of the opportunity to benefit from your full engagement in life.

Every single one of us, when we are fully present, everyone benefits. But when we insist on suffering, we deprive the world from benefiting from us. The world needs every single one of us. So do everyone a favor. Be kind to yourself. Because when you suffer less, you are more available to others. And you're already making the world a better place by suffering less, by giving rise to vexations less.

Some practitioners, when they think about this vow of benefiting sentient beings, one place they go to is like, ""Well, what do I do, you know, like, in terms of having a livelihood, right?"" And for those of you who are here at the monastery, or sometimes you come to practice and think that, ""Oh yeah, but like, you know, I would love to be a priest, but I can't."" Or, and naturally, some, some may be called to priesthood or life in a monastery to support and maintain a place of practice like this monastery, to bring benefits to all sentient beings. But that is not the causes and conditions for everybody. And if that is the case for you, then there's no need to generate suffering about it.

We work with the causes and conditions we have in our life. So the key is to identify a livelihood that does not involve unethical behavior and also that will make good use of your experience, your talents, your skill that can bring benefits to others. When we have this vow of bringing benefits to sentient beings, it can help us find that direction. And when we maintain clear awareness of our causes and conditions, then we can find that, ""Ah, this is the place where I can start.""

Some people, they engage in what we call helping professions, like the therapists I talked to. I have students who are nurses, social workers, and teachers. Of course, there are all kinds of professions that are also needed. I had a student who's a chief operating officer of his company. We have a tendency to think, ""Oh, corporate."" Well, we definitely can use more practitioners in the corporate world.

He talked about how he uses the practice to work with the board and to ensure that his staff will get properly compensated and not be exploited, using and developing his skill to manage that relationship. So then, in that way, bringing benefits to sentient beings.

Or if your talent is in creating and running a business, we definitely need businesses that provide useful services and products, right? And if you're good at making money, if that's part of your talent, you can make good use of your money to support places like the monastery. Somebody needs to make money. So if that's what you're good at doing, go do it with the intention that you will make use of what you're able to make to benefit sentient beings.

Here again, when we say, ""vow to deliver innumerable sentient beings,"" all sentient beings, meaning whether we are sharing space with them this moment or not. So when we are sharing space with sentient beings in the interaction at work, at home, or in other spaces, when we remember our vow of benefiting sentient beings, then it reminds us—besides staying present—to use our speech, our bodily action to bring benefit to them. It can show as being respectful, being courteous, making people feel cared for, loved, and showing kindness, being gentle, supportive, encouraging. And this is even when we disagree with them.

That is the difficult one, right? Oftentimes, when we find ourselves interacting with people with very different views that we disagree with—for example, we disagree, we have different opinions or ideas on how best to achieve something, or on different ideas on what's the most important priority—we notice in those moments the urge to demonize them or to dismiss them: ""They're just stupid,"" or begin to think that they are these really bad people. Notice this urge to demonize and dismiss people with different views from ours.

This is the time we can practice recognizing, noticing the habits. This is a very, very, very entrenched habit—the habit of identifying with our views as the only right one and thinking that others' views are, whatever word you use to judge them. You think if you're sitting here it's like, ""Yes, of course, my view is the only right one."" That's the point I'm making. That's a very entrenched habit. Recognize, recognize the habits of feeling that way, this urge to believe it, that compels us to dismiss, demonize the other person who has different views.

This is a moment for us to practice remembering that every moment is the coming together of causes and conditions. We may think that our view is superior because, I guess, because I'm a superior person. When in reality, the views we have are the coming together of all the moments of our experience—people we talk to, people who taught us, the things we read, things we heard, everything, everything. All our experiences, everything we have encountered, our background, all the information we've been exposed to, we encounter, come together as these views. And it is the same for this other person. They have a different background, different experiences, they've been exposed to different information, so they have those views. Which means if you had the exact same causes and conditions as that person, you would have those views.

If you sit here and think, ""Nah, I don't think so,"" then you are forgetting emptiness. Our views are the coming together of causes and conditions. Difficult to remember this one, though. We can practice and practice remembering this.

So when we remember to practice, when we remember to practice to release the habits of aversion when encountering people with different views and opinions, then that allows us—because our aversion is no longer getting in the way—we can actually be here, open our awareness, and allow ourselves to truly listen. Listen instead of, ""That's so stupid, that's so stupid,"" we can't even hear. Actually listen to what they are saying and be able to appreciate where they are coming from. ""Oh, I can see, yeah, with your experience, I can see why you would feel that way. I can understand. I can see that."" And oftentimes, when people feel heard and seen, all the armor kind of softens. It's like they're ready to fight, then, ""Oh, actually, you're not there to attack them."" They become less defensive and possibly a little bit more open to what we might have to share. Maybe you won't be able to convert them to your view, but maybe there's a way, there's a possibility in opening to find some common ground. Because, after all, we all want to find ways to do something well for everybody.

So this process makes it a little bit more possible for us to find a way forward to benefit all. If we end up still not being able to find common ground, at least we're able to agree to disagree instead of ending up perpetuating more hatred.

One time a retreatant asked me this question, ""What is the point of the practice here?"" I hope you have been asking this question: How is it going to make the world a better place? So I thought of this, and I thought of a bowl of jelly beans. So stay with me. Think about the world—the entire world—as a bowl, a giant bowl of jelly beans. So there are red jelly beans and blue jelly beans. Every time we give rise to hatred in our heart, we throw a red jelly bean in the world. Every time we do not give rise to hatred and remember to be kind and listen, we throw a blue jelly bean in the bowl.

Well, maybe we are living in a world with a lot of red jelly beans. And it's up to all of us to turn this bowl of jelly beans every moment into a more red jelly bean, more filled with hatred, or less, fewer red jelly beans. Every moment, every moment we choose to react with hatred, perpetuate hatred or aversion in our mind, that moment, another red jelly bean, another red jelly bean. So you can ask yourself, ""Which color jelly beans have I been throwing into the bowl?""

Every single one of us, every moment, we have an opportunity to make the world a better place. Which do we choose? Every moment is a brand new moment to put a different color jelly bean in the world in every interaction we have.

So when we are fully engaged with each moment, that gives us an opportunity to see what's going on. That allows us to notice, ""Ah, all the things that are working well."" And keep that in mind: ""Yeah, okay, this is good."" And also maybe notice things that can use some adjustments that will allow us to grow. So it's not about, ""Oh, it's all good, you know, just keep doing the same."" No, you notice things and then you can adjust and keep growing. And when appropriate or when we are asked—sometimes we ask, ""Is there anything that, you know, feedback you have?"" If you haven't been paying attention, ""Everything's fine, because you notice anything."" But if you have been paying attention, then when we are asked, we are more able to perhaps share some constructive feedback that is a way to benefit other sentient beings, because they want to be able to grow, and we are there to support them by providing some constructive feedback.

This is when I remember Master Sheng Yen's quote that I actually use for the signature of my email. I share this with you here, and this is what I use in my daily life: ""Wherever we go, whether or not you benefit from being there, let that place benefit from your being there."" Let that place benefit from your being there. Usually, in our self-centered way, we think about, ""What am I going to get from this? What am I going to get from this?"" Drop that habit; let that place benefit from our being there.

I've been talking about interacting with other sentient beings we encounter. Of course, sometimes, you know, there are sentient beings that are not in our presence. We can also think about how our action might affect them. Here in the last few days in the retreat practice—and actually you can do that at home—when we remember to stay in the practice, for example, we will be more likely to remember to open and close the door quietly and not let it slam and kind of startle everyone, because that can affect other people, can get people all shaken up. Little things, little things. But that is, at that moment, you can remember practice and benefit others.

Or not leave a mess for others to clean up. I have this practitioner who talked about how her husband would come home and leave a sock at the bottom of the stairs and then another sock at the top of the stairs. That drives her nuts. And you may think, ""Socks, you know, what's the big deal?"" It's like, well, when we leave a mess for others to clean up, not only are we making them do the cleaning up, but it makes them feel unloved. That's why it's upsetting.

And I remember many years ago when I was traveling with Master Sheng Yen as his translator. When we were done at the conference, we needed to check out of the hotel. He told us, ""You clean up your room in the hotel."" At that time, I was like, ""Well, we pay for the hotel. Why would we clean? They pay people to come clean the room."" But I remember this every time I would do it. And then one time I finally realized, ""Oh, it's like if I leave a mess, not only does the person who comes and cleans the room have a lot more work, but it makes them feel unloved. You just treat them as like not a human being, just leave this for them to just clean up after us."" So it's a way for us to show that we care about them, even though we may not get the opportunity to meet them in person.

And lastly, I do want to mention this. In our practice, we encounter, like, right here, people who guide us in our practice, support us on the path, like all the residents, the Roshi, and the priests here who devoted their life to supporting others in their practice. One important way to bring benefits to sentient beings is to show appreciation, show love and care to the people who teach and guide us in the practice.

The reason why I want to make this point is oftentimes practitioners make the assumption that, ""Well, they're very advanced, you know, they don't really need, they don't really need people to, like, you know, show care about them and they can just take anything, you know."" Well, they are human beings and also can use encouragement and love and care.

The reason why I talked about this is many years ago I heard of a story of a very good teacher in a community, and he decided to stop teaching because he got fed up. Got fed up because—I know a little bit about that community—it's not their strong point, appreciating the teacher, showing appreciation. The teacher, it's like they prefer complaining. And so they probably think that, ""Oh yeah, you know, you're very advanced, you don't need appreciation."" Well, but that's what it ended up. It was a shame because he's a very good teacher, and he got fed up by how he was taken for granted and treated by a sangha that preferred complaining and making demands and not showing appreciation.

So when we remember to show appreciation, finding ways to take care, take care of sangha members, our guides and teachers, what we are doing is to support and keep them feeling encouraged, so that under the nourishment, they can continue to do the work of guiding and supporting other sentient beings on the path. Sometimes we think, ""Oh, teachers just, like, they are like these independently existing entities."" No, we co-create a teacher. A loving, supportive, appreciative sangha co-creates a loving, supportive teacher.

So I want to leave you with that. Thank you for your attention. Thank you for listening.

Our topic of the evening is Buddhist study. She started her mondo on teacher-student relationship and said that that was the edgiest of the eight gates. And afterwards I was like, oh, did I choose the least edgy? But I'm not sure that's true. I chose this topic because I love study. I've learned to love study, and it's become an important part of my ongoing practice. Study is bringing us into direct contact—directly to the Buddha's teachings, to the Dharma treasure.

When the Buddha was dying and his students were bereft and saying, “What are we going to do?” he said a couple of things, but one of the main things that he said was kind of like, “You have the Dharma. Trust that you have what you need. You have the teachings, these precious teachings.” What could be more precious than the outline of the path to liberation, the path out of suffering, to liberate suffering? And really, Buddhist practice and realization is realizing what the Buddha realized and taught.

So, study is one of the eight gates. It’s worth noting that Daido Roshi chose to present the eight gates as gates of training. A gate is a place of entry. In each of the eight gates, what does that mean? How do we enter? What does it mean to enter? What do we have to do in order to enter? How do we find our way in? Some gates of practice are probably more natural places of entry for some of us than others, and that may not always be obvious. Sometimes for an artist, art practice is actually a difficult place to enter. Or for an athlete, it’s like, “I know how to work out, but what is body practice?” And that may be true for many of us with study. Most of us, all of us, have had some experience with study in a different form. Maybe that wasn’t such a place of meeting our life, meeting truth.

So, how do we enter through study? And with each of the gates, I guess part of that question of what is it to enter is: What is it to study the self through this gate? What is it to study the Dharma through this way of practicing, studying? And each of the gates can be an ongoing place of entry, inquiry. And so when we see that one of the gates is no longer open, alive for us, how do we make it alive, bring it alive again?

The Zen school has a particular relationship with study, some history. You’ve probably all heard this famous quote from Bodhidharma that Zen is a special transmission outside of the scriptures, is not reliant on words and letters, is not reliant on the sutras. It’s a direct pointing to the human mind and realization of Buddhahood. As an aside, we always attribute this to Bodhidharma, but apparently this didn’t show up in the records for hundreds of years after his life. But it’s an important way of understanding the Zen school.

So, the emphasis on direct experience and a kind of warning, right, that words and ideas can only point. You can know for yourself your true nature, but you can’t explain it. We talk about the finger pointing at the moon—don’t confuse the finger for the moon. This is important because we can do this. We can get confused. We do get confused. We’re used to being able to figure things out. We’re smart, we’re used to understanding things in our way of understanding things, and we trust that. Particularly until we have some experience of understanding something more directly, knowing something more directly, kind of knowing how to experience, that feels like sometimes it’s like, “No, it must be this way of understanding,” because we don’t know something else.

And so Bodhidharma gives us this important warning. We can be studying the Dharma and not studying the self. Studying the Dharma and not practicing. Talking about practice rather than practicing. Explaining practice to ourselves or explaining the Dharma to ourselves and not actually meeting ourselves, working with ourselves. And so our emphasis on direct experience—we’re the meditation school, that’s the focus. If you think about how we practice, the emphasis on zazen, our intensive retreats, sesshin, there is no reading and writing. That’s very explicit, so that we can be—to help us be with our direct experience. And that’s taken up in other places in different ways. I remember Daido Roshi always used to talk about the first monastery where he trained: the library was locked. You weren’t allowed to study. And so this emphasis on direct experience is important, right? It’s true. The teachings are always pointing us to our own mind, always helping us. Their only purpose is to help us understand our own mind, understand ourselves, to realize what the Buddha realized and taught.

And so I think just to hold these both. I think that there are ways in which Bodhidharma’s—you know, the locked library, I would say, was sort of a misunderstanding of Bodhidharma’s warning. And we can probably look around and see places where there is study happening rather than practice. My sense is that study and practice have always gone together—always both been integral parts of the path.

Last week, I was reading some of the early Zen teachings, Bodhidharma and his immediate successors, and they both—all—left teachings, written teachings, and they all quoted the sutras. They were all quoting the teachings, pointing towards the teachings.

I’ve been thinking a little bit about my own experience of study practice here and how that’s evolved, how I’ve seen that evolve in my time here. I think particularly in seeing how Shugen Roshi, in his time as abbot, has given more attention to study. I feel like I observe in him, in my teacher, how important study is to his practice. I think it always has been, is my sense, and I just—I see it ongoing and so learning from his example.

So, that was a bit of an introduction. I want to pause here and have you do a little bit of sharing. If you could turn to someone next to you—and you folks at home, if you could, we’ll help you do that. Sorry I didn’t give you any warning. Just to share a little bit: What is your relationship with Buddhist study? So with this gate of practice, do you study? What do you study? Do you have resistance to this gate of practice, struggles? And how is this a gate for you? Should I say that again? So, what’s your relationship with Buddhist study? How is it a gate of practice for you? Is it a gate of practice for you? Do you study? What do you study? Are there places of resistance, struggle with this gate of practice?

Okay, so if you turn to a partner, and this will just be a few minutes. And you’re just speaking and listening. Those of you online on Zoom, if you have things to share, that’d be wonderful. If you could put those in the chat.

Are they all back? And can we hear a little bit about what you shared with your partner?

I have a question. So, what’s the difference between, I guess, reading texts and whatnot and studying them? Because I can’t imagine it’s the same thing as when you’re in school studying, you know, biology or math or whatever, and I guess I have a hard time understanding what studying is.

Yes, yes, yes, that’s a good question. Can we kind of hold that? I think we’re going to talk about that and come back to you. I’ll come back to you to make sure we’ve gotten that.

Madhav: I was just relaying that I had a lot of resistance towards study, especially—I mean, before my practice here, I would—one of the things that attracted me to Buddhism, I think, is that it’s like, “Oh, you don’t have to read. You can just meditate.” And I have, I think, some difficulties or resistance towards just reading in general. And then Chloe was saying, “Oh, you could just listen to audiobooks, I guess, audio sutras. I could do that.” But yeah, as I’ve practiced more, I’ve come to see the value of Buddhist study and in particular, even if you’re reading a chapter—maybe one paragraph in there, it kind of touches you. And that, that kind of shifts some small thing and kind of, I don’t know, keeps the momentum of the practice going and inspires you in a certain way—raises bodhicitta.

Thank you.

A few of us talked about the interaction between zazen and study—how texts that might be inaccessible in the middle of a busy day might be accessible and take root as an extension of meditation practice.

And then one more: My partner and I have very similar experiences of intellectualizing instead of studying the self through Buddhist study. Intellect as near enemy of study of Dharma and self.

Last one, Laura says: When I found the right book, study helps zazen feel more alive. My challenge is finding the right books.

Yeah, yeah. Thank you for all that.

So, anything else?

Yes, Madhav’s statement brought it up. Let me go with that. So, curiously, we get good at audiobooks, but it’s an oral tradition, you know, and the fact of—and then I’m reminded, just pulling from a history in philosophy, I mean, Socrates is very anti-text and very much about word-to-word discussion, like, has to be alive. And text to him is like—it’s a dead thing. Like, we’ve reified it, we’ve frozen it. And in our discussion, I was saying the most successful Buddhist study I have is I meet with a friend once a week and we read it together out loud. And that part of that, that makes it alive versus this sort of silent thing into my head. I just throw that out there.

Yeah, yeah. So, coming back to the, like, what makes it Buddhist study? How do we let it be alive? And if you think about, you know, you’re right: originally it was an oral tradition in the Buddha’s time, right? There was a lot of debate and it was all oral, right? And they would like, memorize the Buddha’s teachings. You know, the Tibetan tradition, the debate. And we do a little bit of that—not the debate so much, but, you know, the monastics meet every week to do some study. The seniors meet every month to do some study. And that’s a little—we do things like this, we do things like the ango intensive, where there is some discussion, some back and forth, because that’s a helpful way in, right?

Yeah. Yosh and I talked about how much study is too much study, because there is too much study, I think, but there can also be too little, right? So just about finding a sweet spot where it’s staying alive and you’re not sort of hiding from practice by being a big nerd. This is a quote that I found: “Those who read should only look at books for a while, then hasten to put them away to test them in practice.”

Yeah, that’s—oh, sorry, I got passed the microphone, so I guess it’s my turn. I found study to be one of the most poignant ways of giving me new practices and, you know, or deepening ones that I’ve been working with. Especially, you know, this past year, I spent a lot of time with the Satipatthana Sutta, and I found that to be, like, so useful in giving me, like, all these different kinds of practices that then have a solid base. And I wouldn’t have had that if it wasn’t for studying. So I found that to be really useful.

Yeah. And I was going to say this later, but so I also have that experience, right? And so that’s why study can be so important. And then how do we integrate, right? So, like, I’m not looking for a new practice, right? Or new—so how do I, when I look at the Satipatthana Sutta, how do I let that inform my zazen practice? And so I think that can be a little bit of an edge, right? There’s so much out there that’s available, and so how do we use it to deepen our practice rather than kind of scattering us?

Right. Is it my—it’s my turn.

Josh and I spoke about how when we read and we don’t really have much of an oral culture anymore, so when we read and we take in information that way, we sort of reify it a bit. So, it’s like, “Oh, I’ve read that book,” and you might not remember anything about that book, or you might remember one thing, but if you kept revisiting it as you would if you were in an oral tradition, then you get a lot more out of it. You remember a lot more. And it can be more alive because of the repetition. And I think an important part of study for me is not trying to read all the books, just maybe rereading books occasionally, if only passages.

Yeah, yeah, definitely coming back to things over and over again over time. And, you know, so that’s true. Like, I overheard Raku-san, I think, talking about how, you know, we don’t memorize things anymore, but we could, right? Like, it can be helpful to—like, what are the five skandhas, you know, to, like, know. And so, yeah, that’s like a helpful way. It’s still a part of language pedagogy. You have to memorize poems sometimes and things like that. So we could bring that into this.

Rebecca: I’ve found that when I’m at home and I’m just feeling in a funk during the day, if I listen to just even a little bit of a Dharma talk with a teacher that I connect with, just, like, taking in the energy of Dharma can plug me back into myself. And that’s one way that study really helps me.

Yeah. Thank you.

Okay, so I have this broken out a little bit as, like, why do we study, and then how do we study—we’re already touching on that—and then, if there’s time, to talk a little bit about, well, what do we study?

And as I was working on this first section, you know, so, you know, there is studying just to understand the tradition, right? Most of us were not raised Buddhist or raised in the Buddhist culture. It’s like, what is this that we’re taking up? We are part of a tradition, right? And part of a school. So, like, to understand, well, what is that? There is study and kind of testing the teachings so that we can have trust—to trust enough to take the next step, to keep practicing.

There’s a contemporary teacher—I think it was Thanissaro Bhikkhu—who talks about, you know, we don’t need to believe anything. We’re not asked to believe in Buddhism or believe in the Buddhist teachings, right? That’s—the Buddha himself said that very clearly. But Thanissaro Bhikkhu suggests—but it’s really helpful to have conviction in the teachings. It’s a little bit of a different tone to that. We can develop that conviction through our own study, through our own testing of the teachings. That’s what the Buddha said to do. He said, don’t believe what I say because I am the world-honored one, because I am the Buddha. Test it for yourself. In the Kalama Sutta, he goes through this whole list: Don’t believe anything simply because you’ve heard it. Don’t believe in traditions because they’ve been handed down. And then he says, “But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.”

Maybe most importantly, we study because we need help, we need guidance. In the same way that it is so helpful to have a teacher—in some ways necessary to be able to work with a teacher—well, study can offer that. We can meet a teacher on the page, meet a teacher in a talk that we’re listening to. I’ve talked to people who said that. I have a friend who said Joko Beck was her first teacher. She never met Joko Beck, but she read her book so thoroughly and so many times, it was like that was teaching her. There have been times for me where I found a teacher in a book that was like, this is just what I need right now. And for a while that was just what I needed. That teacher was teaching me.

We need instruction, we need guidance, we need help staying on the path, understanding what we’re doing. And there’s study to develop right understanding. So, right understanding or right view is one of the steps of the Eightfold Path. I think this is sort of where study is integral with practice—is not other than practice. Sometimes in some presentations of the Eightfold Path, right understanding comes first. We have to have some understanding in order to practice, in order to take another step along the path. And right understanding comes at the end; it is what we realize ultimately—a traditional understanding of—well, I’ll get to that maybe.

And so there can be in study a kind of back and forth, kind of moving in and out. How do we reach out into the teachings, put ourselves out into the teachings, and how do we let them enter us? Study can also be a place where our conceptual understanding mind meets our non-conceptual mind. Or we can use our conceptual mind through study to kind of get to a non-conceptual understanding. It kind of lays the groundwork. Again, the teachings are always pointing us to our own mind, helping us to understand our own mind. It’s always about helping us to realize.

And so from the time of the Buddha, the teachings are a teacher—someone, a person, speaking from their own experience, trying to guide through sharing their own experience, trying to share their own practice and realization in order to help us understand our own experience. So, the teachings can—I think someone shared this—you know, that the teachings can help us understand what we have already experienced. They can also point us to what we have not yet experienced, but pointing us to what can be realized. And sometimes they can help bring us to an experience, help us to realize something, understand something for ourselves.

And so I think of this sort of back and forth, moving in and out. How do we do that? How does that happen? How do we kind of reach ourselves out and enter the teachings? How do we let them enter us and allow them to turn our mind?

Years ago, Shugen Roshi said something in a talk about how he felt like he was realizing—he was seeing—how practice is simply continuing to clarify for ourselves the Four Noble Truths. And, you know, I think—and this is one of those things that, like, from years ago has always—I just—I heard that and took that in and always remembered that, just that short part of that talk. And I think that he must have been speaking from his own experience in that moment, right? And it also—that is just what the teachings are, right?

So, as I think I just said, so the right understanding, ultimately, sort of the traditional understanding is that we are realizing for ourselves the Four Noble Truths. That is right understanding. That’s sort of the big part of right understanding. And that’s true of all of the teachings—to take them in, study and reflect, take them into our practice, and then they’re in you. And then in your zazen, sometimes you can use them to guide yourself. The teacher’s not always sitting there answering your questions for you, helping you—how do I deal with this?—but you have the teachings with you, and so you can give yourself what you need, give yourself the guidance that you need.

And sometimes, because the teachings are in you, as you are working with your own mind in your own direct practice, in your zazen, something becomes clear—not because you’re sitting with that, trying to understand that teaching, but just because that’s in you and you’re working with your mind. You’re encountering your mind.

Let me just pause here for a sec, see if there are questions or comments, thoughts.

So, I want to speak a little bit more directly to right understanding. To be—that we are cultivating right view, right? So the “right,” which is in a sense correct, right or appropriate, is sometimes translated bringing our view into alignment with this right view. Because we all have a view, or maybe we have many views. We act out of those views. We experience the world through those views.

Something I was reading, this teacher was suggesting—even the simple activity of brushing your teeth is based in a view, in an idea, in a certain kind of understanding. “If I brush my teeth, I won’t get cavities.” Some people say, “If you floss, you’ll live longer,” right? And so that action, since it’s based in that, based in a view, based in an idea—it’s not to say that we’re always acting rationally, but I don’t know, sort of look into that, right? We’re acting based on an idea, and we may or may not be conscious of that. Often we are not. And we may or may not be conscious of where this view came from. Maybe most of the time, a lot of the time, we’re not conscious of that. And sometimes our experience will sort of bear out, will verify our view.

So I was remembering when I graduated from high school and sort of moved out of the house and my mother was no longer making dentist appointments for me—I didn’t go to the dentist for quite a while, and I don’t think I was brushing my teeth enough either. I got a bunch of cavities, and I went to the dentist and they sort of put the fear of God into me, and I started brushing my teeth more. Haven’t had any cavities. Sometimes we verify like that.

But so in cultivating correct right understanding, it’s like we’re cultivating a correct understanding of the Buddha’s teachings rather than our own view. Our own views may be more comforting, based in our own emotions. But look around: what does that lead to? The sort of tangle of views based in our own emotions.

And so right understanding traditionally is understood as understanding the Four Noble Truths—so suffering, its cause, cessation, the skillful activities, practice of the Eightfold Path. It’s understanding of karma, so the law of cause and effect: what we do has an effect. Daido Roshi used to say, “What we do and what happens to us are the same thing.” I find it helpful to understand karma as habit, power of habit. And then I think from the Mahayana point of view, we could add upaya—so understanding skillful and unskillful, what is leading to freedom and what is not, what is more binding—and dependent origination or emptiness: all things are impermanent, changing, have no fixed essence.

And so how is this moving in and moving out? How are we guided by this right understanding? How do we use this right understanding, this correct view?

So I’ll try another pair share—maybe turn to someone different, mix yourselves up a little bit—and see if you can find, share an experience where you used your understanding, your Dharma, your understanding of the teachings, used your right understanding, your right view, to help yourself. To help yourself understand something that was happening in you or to work with something. So maybe you were meeting a difficult state of mind. Maybe you were meeting a strong desire, just as possibilities. And how did you use the teachings? How did the teachings—either to sort of understand what was happening or to work with your mind, to work with yourself?

Okay, so again, we’ll take about five minutes. So a couple minutes, and then your partner has a couple minutes. And so just see if you can try and find an experience. So again, folks on Zoom, please share in the chat so we can hear from you too.

And can we hear from—sounded like there was a lot to say in that one. Anyone want to share?

So I got to speak to one that is very alive. I just started working with it today. The food here is so good, and there’s so much of it, and I’ve been overeating most meals for about a month, and it leaves me feeling tired and, like, super full and lethargic. It impacts my practice. It impacts my mood. Like, it’s just—in general, I’m like, why am I doing this? And, you know, so I’ve been kind of, like, stalking it a little bit of like, okay, well, what’s going on here? And, you know, looking at the causes of it, it’s like, oh, there’s not that much stimulation here. So this is, like, a little hit, right? You get, like, all this delicious food, so boom. Like, the suffering is—right, the cause of the suffering is kind of—I’m looking at it. It’s like, okay, I’m overeating. And then looking at the reasons why, kind of just going through each of these things. And essentially today I was like, all right, I don’t want to feel this way. I don’t need to be loyal to this piece of suffering. And so I can choose differently. And today was a success. So thank you.

I’m excited to share this one because it’s outside of this tradition a little bit. I—I guess I have to contend with, like, horror of birth and death and violence, like, a lot, because I’m an anxious person. And something that I have found that helps is one day—I’m not gonna even bother sharing what was bringing up the horror. It could just, you know, pick your favorite one—and I ended up meditating on a wrathful deity, actually. Taikyo has—it’s Vajra Varahi. You have a sticker. It’s great. Garland of heads. There’s usually fire, fangs, they’re very scary. But I learned at some point that they’re benevolent. And something about meditating on the wrathful deity—like, long story short, I kind of, like, took the horror that was in my mind that was like, I felt like I had to push it away. I couldn’t understand it. I didn’t want to turn away from it because that seems dishonest. And something about meditating on the deity made me feel like there was a place for it in the cosmology. Like, whatever horrific thing is bothering me about existence, it’s part of the perfection. And something about the very vivid imagery of the wrathful deity and the understanding that this was created to kind of deliver a point. It was created with the intention to be benevolent. I don’t know, it just—it really clicked something for me. And ever since then, it’s not a big part of my practice, but it’s like, it’s somehow comforting to be like, this isn’t something that I have to push away. Like, the horror is kind of baked into the whole thing, the whole life thing.

Okay, thank you. Everyone else, how do you use the teachings?

Yes, there’s a few here. So, Philip: Sharon Osho’s description of empty boats bumping in the mist has lodged in my accessible memory enough for recall when my boat is bumped sometimes.

Mike Kaysey says: We talked about how much we put the teaching of right speech to test at work, where complaining and criticizing others becomes a central way that people sometimes bond with each other. So the precept becomes a knot of difficulty. You want to bond, but not at any price. You want to affirm people’s experience, but not by pressing others down. You want to feel part of something, but you just don’t want it to be a complaining session—although it often is. But we both agreed it comes up all the time, every day, and we try to see it clearly and practice it well.

Thank you.

Yeah. I just want to share—just a few weeks ago, during a Dharma talk, I was stricken by the idea of “not two.” And that’s been really useful to me when interacting with the world at large. With my son, for example, when I get angry at him, you know, and being like, not two—he’s not me either, not one, but not two, he’s not that. And that right away, in a weird, selfish way, gives compassion and calms everything down. Like, someone is swerving around and I’m, like, getting angry and like, oh, not two. That could be you. They probably have reasons, you know, and that—every time I’m able to bring that up, they’re not two. That recenters me and somehow, I don’t know, opens me to the other person and removes the wall—“that’s them and there’s me.” It’s like, no, but not no. You know, if that makes sense.

And why do you say that that’s selfish?

It’s self-serving a bit, I guess in a sense it helps me, you know. It’s like, being angry is not good for you. It’s not nice either. And so being able to use that to not give in to it—well, it’s a bit selfish, I guess.

I mean, being angry isn’t good for your son either.

I totally agree. Yeah, yeah, no, for sure. It’s like, of course, not two.

I use studying the precepts in my life by—well, one of the patterns I learned very young was that I have to lie and steal in order to be okay. I really felt like that was true, and that’s like a really strong feeling in my body. But I really trust and have faith in the precepts, that not stealing and not lying will actually bring me in the direction that I want to go. So I notice in moments when I feel like I’m about to lie, I can pause and feel that my body doesn’t trust that I’ll be okay if I don’t lie. But there is this other faith that I have in the teachings that I can—that can give me the courage in that moment to step in the other direction. And it always feels so much better.

And over time, has that sort of changed your view? So you have this—in a way you have this view that you have to lie or steal to feel okay. Is that changing as the evidence shows you otherwise?

Yes, yes, I noticed that now there’s like a paved path in my own body that tells me that I’ll feel better if I go in the direction of not stealing or lying. And then in the moments when I still slip up, it’s so much more accentuated how bad I feel. And like, it takes many trial and error, but over time I’m learning, like, okay, this really does feel so much better.

Thank you. Anyone else?

Sorry, I forgot, that’s your bad.

What do you think about right view becoming an obstacle when you may have an understanding—a right understanding—of a teaching, you may even have direct experience of that teaching and that reality, but the understanding becomes maybe a box or an expectation or—what do you think about right view becoming an obstacle in creating a fixed reality?

Well, does... Like, do you experience that?

I think that sometimes I can expect reality to be a certain way if I behave a certain way or think a certain way or—and that doesn’t always work out? It doesn’t always work out, but sometimes it does. But—

So then where’s the barrier? Where’s the problem? Like, is it in—like, is your view incorrect or is that—

Well, the view may not be incorrect, but I’m wondering about believing the view as a thing.

I mean, I guess I hear—I think I’m hearing something about expectation. You expect that if you act in a particular way, then things are going to turn out in a particular way. And that’s not always true.

I think I’m more asking about making the Dharma into something.

Well, that is—our job is not to turn the teachings into something, right? So, yes, if you’re experiencing that, then you’re sort of verifying that way that we can get stuck or sort of misuse the teachings, right? They’re not meant to become a belief. The other thing is—this is not directly related to your question, but reminds me of—we also—it’s like we can misunderstand the teachings, right, and sort of misuse the teachings. And so how do we not get fixed, right, and stay open to continual verifying, in a way, right?

Okay. I’ll talk a little bit about how do we study—part of what you were asking at the beginning. Some thoughts about how we study.

When I talk about—during the introductory weekends—I talk a little bit about study as a gate, and I often use the talk announcement. So before we hear a Dharma talk, there’s the encouragement that the talk may be—parts of it at least—may be dark to the mind. We can’t understand it in our usual way of understanding, but it can be radiant to the heart. We can understand it, we can take it in. How do we do that? And so we can kind of bring that same spirit to different ways of encountering the teachings.

So, when we are studying something, how do we allow ourselves to be open? And so that may be helpful. So when we listen to a talk, the guidance is that we sit in a zazen posture. We sit in a formal posture, which is open and receptive. In the tradition, there’s encouragement to not study a Dharma text while you’re lying down or slouching—I’m guilty—but it’s like, there’s a reason for that. Sometimes when I read that, it’s like, that’s kind of expressing, kind of showing, reverence for the Dharma, right? But it’s also because you’re not going to receive it in the same way as if you’re sitting upright.

Do we concentrate, right? So part of the talk instruction is practice just listening. So practice just reading, just taking in what you’re studying—really, that’s in any gate of practice, right? Concentration. Cultivating that.

How do we allow the teachings to be alive? How do we allow them in? There is instruction—you don’t hear so much in Zen—but to read and to reflect and then to verify. And so I think of study as sort of being the reading and reflecting part. What Tysha was saying at the beginning—how do we do that reflecting? Sometimes it might be helpful to have someone else, say, “How do you understand this?” Or, “Can I explain this to you? What I’m taking from this?” How do we do that reflecting? It takes some work sometimes to kind of get into the teachings, right? Sometimes they’re just hard to understand. And how do we find our way in so that there are—this reflecting part is like, how do we make it actually meet our experience, meet our life, so it’s not just an idea?

I think someone talked about coming back to things. So I think there is both ongoing study—I remember once at one point Shugen said to me, “You should always be reading something. You should always be studying something.” And so, sort of just to, like, keep ourselves in contact, right? There’s a reason that we hear a talk every week, right? Over time that, like, sinks into us. Daido Roshi used to—I remember him saying, you know, people would come up and say, “Thank you, that was such a great talk. Thank you, that was so helpful.” And sort of to the side, he would say, “I say the same thing every time.” And that’s not quite true, right? There’s some great talks, but it’s also kind of true. But we need to hear it over and over and over again, right? We hear little bits. Each time it kind of soaks in, and sometimes then we finally hear it.

And there is coming back to things. You know, I come back to, you know, sort of like circle around through the Zen sutras, right? Some of them are, like, difficult to understand. You read the Diamond Sutra—the first time I read the Diamond Sutra, it’s like, what? And the second time, it’s kind of like, what? You know, like, you keep coming back to it. And you’ve been practicing over time, and so you’ve changed, right? And things change. Maybe something enters this time. You understand something a little differently this time. And I find that’s true with all different kinds of teachings. So just to, like, keep coming back to them.

There’s a way—I was thinking about—I see this particularly in the Tibetan teachings, how they kind of seem repetitive. It’s like every time a teacher gives a teaching, they start with this whole kind of lead-in. And it’s like—but that’s helpful to hear it over and over again, to be reminded over and over again.

There is a way of kind of carrying the teachings around with you. And so maybe this is part of reflection, but I remember years ago, one of my early teachers said something—you know, like they had been, like, driving to Boston, and they said, “You know, while I was driving to Boston, I was thinking about that Dogen fascicle, reflecting on that.” And it was like, I don’t do that when I’m driving to Boston. But so, how about that, right? What are we—like, we can do that. And what happens then if we’re, like, just kind of carrying something around, checking in with it, reflecting a bit?

There are other ways of—I think Tycha was also saying this, right? So there is, you know, reading something silently to yourself is one way of encountering the teachings. Reading it out loud to yourself is different, right? I shared recently—I was doing that in a hermitage recently—I was like, “Whoa, this is very different. This is really helpful. I’m meeting this in a different way. It is entering me in a different way.” We chant—sometimes we chant the Heart Sutra every morning. We’ve been chanting some other teachings. That’s a different way of letting them in. There is a tradition of copying sutras, copying teachings, because that’s a different way of letting it in. And so to find different ways, to experiment with different ways, right? If it’s dead for you, do something different.

Andrew: I was just gonna ask, in terms of what we’re studying, about taking up texts that wouldn’t be, like, specifically Buddha Dharma texts. Like, you know, that the Dharma is not limited to that. You know, we can take it up through all kinds of texts. Everything’s pointing in a different way. So, like, I’ve got my Rilke poetry book, you know, and he’s pointing for me at a lot of things that feels grounded in Buddha Dharma. So how do we take up texts from all kinds of sources or study, like, this vast world, you know?

Well, a couple of thoughts. I mean, one, I would sort of question whether everything is pointing in the same direction, right? It’s not. When there are other views that are being expressed that are not the Buddhist teachings, that is not right understanding from the Buddhist point of view, right? And I guess my other—you know, so, which, kind of what I hear you saying about Rilke, you know, so they’re also—like, how about, can you read Rilke through your Buddhist understanding, right? I’ve been hearing some Rumi, right? It’s like, it’s a different tradition, and there are some things that are different, right? And we can, like, understand that and sort of bring it in line with our Buddhist understanding.

Yeah. Getting to your question, definitely. I think, I guess when it feels grounded in Dharma, it’s like even reading something that is, like, wrong understanding is learning about that, or we’re contacting our suffering, understanding that, and turning it and working with that.

Okay. If you are—right, there also is—you know, there have been—there also is—sometimes I’m reading something, I’m like, this isn’t feeding me. And sometimes it’s just a little entertaining, and so that’s why I’m reading it, maybe, but then it’s also like, that’s enough of that, because it’s not feeding me, it’s not helping me, it’s not pointing in the right direction. And I may be also hearing your question: we have to be discerning in what we study. And so if it is grounding, if it is feeding you, to know that, to discern that, and like, okay, turn towards that. And if it’s not, then not.

And I guess I would say that, you know, that’s also true—well, maybe, never mind.

You mentioned a couple times, if you’re reading something and it feels dead, make it alive. What does that mean? Or—you seem to be a rhetorical—how do you make it alive?

How do you make it alive? Yeah. I mean, I’ve offered some examples, right? You know, so you know that experience that I had of, you know, reading texts that I had read many times silently to myself, reading it then out loud, right, was very different. I don’t know that I quite have an answer for you, Ben. I feel like it’s sort of pointing to that. That is part of our, I don’t know—“task” isn’t quite the right word, but, like, in this gate of practice, right? How do we find our way in, right? You know, maybe another—you know, it’s sort of like the coming back to, coming back to a text, you know, is another way. So it’s—so I’m not finding my way in right now, but I’m not going to reject it, right? I’m going to put it down, go on to something else, and I come back to it later, right? But we do have to find our way in, right? I mean, I guess another thought is that there are different kinds of study that are helpful at different times. And so sometimes the Diamond Sutra is not what I need. I need something that’s much more accessible, a more contemporary teacher that has done some work for me in terms of making it more relatable to my life in this time and place, has done some translating from cultures for me. Sometimes what I need is just some inspiration. So, like, to read a biography of a practitioner—sometimes that’s helpful, and sometimes there’s also some teaching in there. But kind of what I need is just the inspiration.

Yoshi: I was just reflecting on Ben’s question and my experience of, like, I think especially earlier in my practice, really struggling with depression and, you know, difficult feelings, and being able to go to a Dharma text and actually find that really, like, named, you know, the misunderstanding of many lifetimes, like, oh my god, there it is, you know, and it’s been going on for all these hundreds of years that somebody else is talking about this confusion that I feel right now. And to me, that’s just—that’s amazing, right? And Hongzhi, you might be like, wander into the circle of wonder. It’s like, I don’t know where that circle of wonder—but I understand where that misunderstanding of many lifetimes is, because I’m in it, you know, in that life is dukkha, and can land there. So I feel like I was able, and I have been able, to really land and study through my own suffering and just finding so many places—Bodhidharma—that have been so helpful for me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. I really relate to that. And also for me, when I first—particularly when I first came to Buddhism or found Buddhism, it was like both that I recognized what I was feeling and—and there’s something you can do about it. I found that.

Dan, maybe last one.

I’ve seen a lot of monastics during study periods with notebooks next to them.

With what?

With notebooks, writing things. Never asked anyone, so I’m curious, is there like a—do you—and I think I’ve seen you with notebooks as well as you’re reading. Like, do you take—do you—are you just taking notes from what the words are? Are you writing reflections? Is there like a common theme or use? Or is it just kind of per person, per moment, what feels useful there?

I can only tell you what I do. I mean, yes, I find it helpful to take notes. That’s something I’ve learned over time. In actually Buddhist study, I was—like, in school I was never a very good note taker, but I find that it helps me to understand it. Also, I go back to it, and sometimes just as reference, but also I go back to it to find what am I going to talk about when I have to give a talk. Because I both write down, sort of take notes to help me understand, and I just take notes of things like, “This was really helpful,” or “This was inspiring,” or “This was—things that just kind of strike me.”

So, we did not get to what do we study, which I was reflecting, we don’t get a lot of guidance in that. Often people say, “What’s the curriculum? What should I read?” And so maybe that’s a topic for a different discussion, different time. We’ll have to wait.

Okay, thank you, everyone.","Bear Gokan Bonebakker","","","Religion & Spirituality","1:10:08 (approx)","2025 Spring Ango"
37857,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-05-04 12:59","42R","","Zen Center of New York City","Right Imagination","","Good morning everyone in Brooklyn, and wow, so nice to see so many new people here each week. When half the zendo goes upstairs for beginning instruction, it's great to have you. And I would so love to hear what this turning was for you—why you turned to this this morning. I don't know. For some reason right now, I don't even know what hour of the day it is. I don't know. Is it this morning? Anyway, welcome.

Yesterday we watched our second video for the ango, which was on Daido Roshi's teaching—my teacher, who started this Mountains and Rivers Order that you are in the midst of receiving the transmission of, by virtue of your being here and receiving beginning instruction in zazen and entering the practice of what the Buddha offered us over 2,500 years ago as a path to be free of suffering and really understand our heart and mind, our whole being.

So, we watched this video on the Mountains and Rivers Sutra, which was a sutra written by a Zen teacher named Eihei Dogen, which you'll probably hear a lot from if you stick around, in 1240. He was born in 1200 and only lived till 1252, so he was 40 years old when he wrote this sutra. And it's an integration of Daido's understanding and imagination and skillful means of using creative expression to convey the teachings of the Buddha, which is part of our lineage—using the creative expression path to sometimes show students the nature of reality through a brushstroke, through flute playing, through some movement.

And so, I began to—it just came up for me—I started to wonder this week about the role of imagination in practice life, in life. We receive all these methods of training, methods for how to arrange our body in the best way so we can set up an architecture, whether on the floor or a bench or a chair, so that energy can move through our system really openly. And we have to actually test that and work with that to make it skillful. We get the instruction, but we're also different, so we have to make that skillful for ourselves.

We learn all these ways, these antidotes to work with our afflictive emotions. When we're experiencing dullness, laziness, forgetfulness, agitation—obstacles, essentially—when we encounter our stinking thinking, how do we work with that? How do we get hooked on that? What's true? What's real and true? How do we set the thought free? Because sometimes that one thought just binds us, and it may not even be true, but we believe it. That's called our conditioning.

We learn about how to increase concentration and how that is made skillful. How do we imagine it to be? How do we imagine that teaching to manifest inside of ourself, in our practice? And it's great that our ancestors passed down so much wisdom, in whatever tradition we come from. Like, we don't have to starve to death to practice. Buddha became an ascetic, and he took in very little food, just really cut off the senses, and basically was starving—almost died. And he said, don't do that. You don't need to do that. Okay, I'll take that off your plate. You don't have to do that.

Also, Bankei got very sick, and he said, just push through your sickness. And he got sicker. And later he said, don't do that. Take care of yourself, you know? Otagaki Rengetsu, in her grief of losing four children and two husbands, saw that she needed a moving meditation. She worked on the potter's wheel, and she showed that that's sometimes skillful—that we don't just be still, that we actually move the energy in a moving meditation.

And so, we've been given these ways that people have imagined the teachings that can come into our body. And so yeah, I wanted to explore imagination as skillful means and to cultivate what is beneficial for ourselves, for others. In turn, imagination and reality are not in opposition. True imagination goes towards reality, shapes and evokes it.

So we need skillful methods to guide us. We need training. Just like you need training in anything you do—a job or something we want to get proficient at—we need to train in it. And yet at the end, that gets left behind. We don't need to continue now in the Eight Gates. So Daido has this training matrix that we work within—you'll learn about that if you like to. And in the glossary, I looked up skillful means, and the word for it is upaya, which means skillful means, and it says: forms that the teaching takes, reflecting their appropriateness to the circumstances in which they appear. Their purpose is to liberate the clinging mind so we can guide ourselves.

So the ango theme for this three-month period that we're working with is the mountain training. We're looking at these areas of training, and it's been a great ango. I hope those of you that are formally in it are enjoying it. For me, it's been a lot of re-meeting my teacher. He died in 2009, and I've been reading his books again, listening to his talks and hearing his voice, and hearing the teachings like anew. It's been great. And he's just changed his form of teaching, which people do. When people pass, they still teach us, they just change their form of teaching and skillful means.

So if we understand the teachings as skillful means, the next question would be: skillful means for what? And as I said, in Buddhist teachings, it's skillfulness for liberating the clinging mind from suffering. So in coming here, we are entering Daido Roshi's skillful means and the skillful means of the Buddha, the whole tradition.

And Daido used to say there aren't really Eight Gates. So there's body practice, art practice, face-to-face teaching, liturgy, moral and ethical teachings, work practice, right action. He just said, we're just one body, one heart, one mind. But we need to be able to focus on these different aspects of ourselves so we can go more deeply into our creative aspects, our moral aspects, our body, developing our skills for arousing and protecting bodhicitta, the heart-mind that wants to be a benefit in this world.

We have to develop and arouse and protect that within ourselves and see where we turn away and turn towards not creating harm, practicing good, actualizing good for others, cultivating and strengthening our aspiration to be of benefit.

And I read this before, but it came back again. So it's a book on contemporary artists practicing Buddha Dharma, and Robert Thurman—Buddhist scholar, he was the first American monastic of the Dalai Lama and he lived right by the monastery, and he was good friends with the monastery—so I pulled this from him. He says:

Say you are a Buddha and you're free of suffering. Okay, there's imagination right there. Say you are a Buddha. You are. Can you imagine? Say you are a Buddha and you're free of suffering and you feel totally great, as happy as a bee, as happy as a clam, at one with the universe. And then you see all these miserable people. What good would it do for you to go and give them a big grin and hug and smother them with joyfulness? They'll probably just get freaked out and paranoid, and they'll say, what does this person want? You know, we've had people do that to us, right? They'll just get... So instead, a Buddha has to develop some strategies, some art, to first open all that person's imagination. First of all, open that person's imagination to the fact that there is a world where we don't have to be miserable all the time. And then they have to develop for them a method of how to move from their paranoid corner of misery into the great ocean of the universe that you, a Buddha, perceive.

He says, in the sense that none of what Buddha expressed was driven by any sort of selfish impulse on the part of the being that was formerly Siddhartha Gautama. Everything he does is a communication of compassion to other beings, creating doorways to open their imaginations and then their whole beings to enlightenment, to nirvana, to peace. So to first present nirvana first as a work of art allows people to perceive it and open up to the possibility they can experience it for themselves. Who would want to seek nirvana if they couldn't imagine there was such a state, to be free from suffering?

So upaya is Buddha's art. As I said, Buddha was probably one of the first great performance artists. So first of all, to open our imagination to the fact there is a world we don't have to be miserable all the time. What generosity. He could have just gone off and said, I got it. Later, folks. Work it out. But he stayed. He taught with upaya, with skillful means, using the most powerful of mechanisms: our consciousness, the imagination. And we need these skillful means, these teachers, these methods to open us.

Yeah, so I was—this led me to—in the temple notes we put in this poem by Issa: ""Under the cherry trees there are no strangers."" Under the cherry trees there are no strangers. Have you been under the cherry trees with people, or any tree? What is that moment, that experience of being under them? And we're not strangers. There are no strangers.

And it reminded me of this line in Neruda's poem ""Keeping Quiet,"" where he says, ""For once on the face of the Earth, let's not speak in any language. Let's stop for one second and not move our arms so much. It would be an exotic moment, without rush, without engines, we would all be together in a sudden strangeness."" There it is again, that sudden strangeness. And what is it, that if we don't make space for that—to quiet the mind—it's hard to imagine, because we're taken up by the rush of our life, the busyness.

And the Chinese character for busyness is heart over killing, heart killing. We become entrenched when we get too busy. We begin frozen in our imagination, in our actions. It gets really narrow. And do we ever take time to ask, what are we really here for? In real time, what are we really here for? Even in spiritual communities, sometimes people don't ask, which is weird, right? You think, what are we here for?

If we're truly part of a larger spiritual reality that can offer peace and happiness and empower us to make the world healthier, why wouldn't we enthusiastically embrace every practice that might help us enter into that reality? And to my mind, zazen is that primary practice that helps us discover and align ourselves with our true nature and its purpose, taking time to be open and present to a reality beyond what our tiny minds can grasp. Just in those moments of turning around.

This quote—George Bernard Shaw wrote about the true joy of life is in being devoted to a purpose recognized by ourself as a mighty one. He says, being a force of nature, instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.

And I'm not calling anyone here a little selfish clod of anything. I'm just saying: think about it. Are you too busy to do nothing? Which is, rather than being nothing, might actually mean everything to our happiness.

And this reminded me of an essay I read by Janet Ruffing years ago. She wrote this piece called ""The Demon of Busyness."" I'm just going to read you a little bit of it. I'd like to read you all of it because it's excellent. But she said many of us suffer from chronic busyness. And by the way, people always tell me they don't want to take up my time because I'm so busy. And I'm like, wait a minute, how do you know? And I don't say, I know what busyness is. I know what busyness feels like. We have to know what it feels like. But I also am full. I like being full. I like to be full of activity. I enjoy activity. Busyness, I can feel when it turns to heart killing; it just has a different feel to it.

So anyway, she says many of us suffer from chronic busyness, a sense of having so many things to do and not having enough time to do it. Ring any bells? We keep plugging on, hurrying to finish this task so we can get to the next one. She said the Demon of Busyness believes that this unending busyness is profoundly destructive to self-intimacy, intimacy with the divine, interrelationships, reflective thought, the fabric of our society, our care for the planet, and our own psychological and physical health.

She also notes that, contrary to the way most people think about it, busyness is not directly related to how many things we have to do. She cites Sister Gina from Plum Village, who explains concretely how it is possible to be active and engaged but not in a hurry. When we walk in a hurried way, we don't rest in every step. Instead, we seem to quickly touch the earth in order to get somewhere. So I practice taking the hurry out of my steps so that I can come to rest in every step—like our kinhin. It is a bit tricky because there's something in me that tells me if you don't hurry, you're going to be late. But I also experience that if I don't hurry up, I will get there much faster because the hurry comes from the worry, and the worry is very heavy and slows me down. If I drop the hurry and the worry, I can move a bit quicker and be in every step and be on time. Did you ever find that? Or maybe it's just too fast? You can try it. It's a very interesting experiment. You can meet this habit energy that says you have to hurry or you will be late. You can move faster, but you don't need to hurry. It's very handy when you're in the airport and a bit late, she says.

So if busyness is not helpful or sustaining, why is it so common? She said her insight is that we become overwhelmed by busyness because of ego and institutional pressures. We lose our mindful connection with our bodies and hearts. We lose our imagination. There is something about the feeling of busyness that is exhilarating. There is an altered state of consciousness I experience when I swing into action and begin working through today's to-do list. A burst of adrenaline carries me from one activity to another, how many things I can get done in the shortest amount of time. Racing against the clock becomes a game, sometimes an unhealthy competition, but nevertheless a game.

While I'm occupied orchestrating this internal race against time, I feel both strong and important. My ego is firmly in control. I am clearly the center of these activities, and this particular state of mind, of course, is illusory. When I am busy being busy, I avoid making time for leisure, for play, for relationships, for reflection. I delight in moving fast, being caught up in the rhythm of an institution, a city, a community that runs me and overwhelms my internal sense of self and my felt responses to internal and external events. I'm actually being captivated by a false consciousness that is largely generated by the culture outside of me. I go on automatic while believing I'm still in charge.

When I am busy, I can believe myself to be incredibly important in the scheme of things. I become independent, indispensable, necessary. My ego becomes reassured that I'm productive, accomplishing something worthwhile and valuable.

There's a book that the monastics are reading called ""Making Sense of Mind: Why Yogācāra Buddhism Matters"" by Bill Waldron. Yogācāra and Madhyamaka are two of the major schools of Mahayana Buddhism. They're different, but they have complementary perspectives on understanding reality and the path to enlightenment. Madhyamaka emphasizes the wisdom of emptiness, that there's nothing fixed, there's no fixed self or any selfness in anything that's permanent, that stays the same. And we see this in our zazen as we see thoughts come and we relinquish them and just come back to the vastness of the breath—just the breath. So it's right there, and that grows.

Yogācāra, known as the Mind-Only School, speaks of emptiness, but then it focuses on compassion, bringing that into our deeds, how we act, engagement. And so within the teachings of the Yogācāra is the work of Vasubandhu, who spoke of these three natures. Vasubandhu's three natures highlight the imaginary, dependent, and complete realized nature inherent in all aspects of phenomena. You with me? I'm sure you are.

Anyway, the imaginary nature of things is what we think they are, what we imagine them to be. The dependent nature is that they appear to arise from countless conditions. So that's what comes to mind, or all phenomena are momentary arisings that come together from countless conditions. We call it karma or karmic. And the complete realized nature is that they aren't as we imagine them to be—things that can be grasped or pushed away.

The three natures form the backbone of this Yogācāra philosophy. In order for us—skillful means—to see beyond our preconceived notions of ourselves and others, beyond the things that we're convinced are true, and open up a path to personal and communal healing. We don't hold each other fixed—ourselves or others—in something. Buddha encouraged us to use our own creative imagination to open our doors of perception.

And after his realization, when the Buddha was told he should go teach and not tuck away, he went and taught a crowd of thousands on the Prajnaparamita—what we chanted this morning, the Heart Sutra, the emptiness of all the conditions, what we chanted, right? Guess what? It's in the Lotus Sutra. Five or six thousand monks, nuns, and lay people left. They couldn't understand what he was talking about, and they all just got up and walked away. Some scholar called it the Heart Attack Sutra. Some people had heart attacks because Buddha was saying that there's nothing inherently anything, you know?

But yet, in the compassion part, here we are, yet this is here. We have to take care of this reality. But they all left, and Shariputra was there freaking out. What should we do? How are we going to get them back? And he's like, it's okay. It's my mistake. I started in the wrong place. That wasn't skillful. People don't get it. Let me think again. And then he came back and he taught the Four Noble Truths. And he said, hey folks, life suffers. And everybody's like, all ears. I'm in. I get it.

And that there's a cause for that suffering, that causes a thirst that's unsatisfied. Either we have something—we'll put it just kind of simply—we have something, we don't want it, or we don't have it and we want it, and we just circulate. And that's samsara. Never, always dissatisfied. There's this unsatiable thirst. It's called dukkha. And then we can actually—Buddha said—we can put an end to that cycle. We can end it.

And he taught the Fourfold, and he taught the Eightfold Path. And Daido created—dynasty begins with right understanding, and then right thought, right speech. Right could be perfect—right, perfect speech, perfect action. Not like ""right"" as opposed to ""wrong,"" just complete—complete livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

And the second limb of the Eightfold Path, normally translated as right or perfect view, thought, can also be translated, I think, as right imagination. Having the right imagination—in this way, our right view is being able, the ability to go beyond our reactive patterns, beyond socially imposed norms, and envision different possibilities and outcomes which are more skillful and mindful. That's what we're doing. That's skillful means.

So it's an essential part of the Dharma path and teaching to test and direct our experience. What came up for me was—we're an imaginal body, and I realized that term was used a long time ago. Some of you therapists might know Henry Corbin, pre-Jung, who coined this term ""imaginal"" from his work as an interpreter of Islamic thought, where he describes this imaginal realm as holding images, stories, dream figures, embodied imagery, and movements that come to us beyond dimensions of our rational, intellectual perspective.

So we have all these methods that we are given that are very pointed and particular, and yet we're this imaginal body that actually puts it into our reality to be skillful and beneficial. Similarly, creativity—which is ""nedi"" in the Pali language—is crucial if we want to liberate ourselves and create a culture of awakening. We have to be creative.

So I guess, like, I've just been feeling like, please don't lose your imagination and your creativity. Don't get so busy. Find some quiet time to let that imaginal body come through.

In an essay by Stephen Batchelor, he explained how the Buddha often compared our development along the dharmic path with the creative labor of craftsmen, musicians, artists, doctors, who apply their desire, their effort, intuitions, and willingness to experiment to their projects. He says, using these skills and qualities, creative laborers begin with the raw materials of their work and transform them so completely into useful and beautiful products that the process is, in a fundamental sense, magical. We take the raw materials of our heart and mind and see them for what they are so that we can transform them into something useful, magical, which we are—like we hear in our may: we exist in muddy water with purity, like a lotus.

Have you ever seen—like a lotus grows out of the muck—that's us, and that muck has all the nutrients we need. So it's the stuff that we want to say, like, if I didn't have that, I'd be fine. If I wasn't like this, it would be okay. But how can we imagine that that darkness, that muck that we sludge through, has the nutrients to make us this whole beautiful being that we are? And once we can imagine that it comes together, we have much more space to hold the parts that we feel like we want to jettison in ourselves and in others. We accord it with the priceless gift of our attention.

He says keen attention becomes an act of deep regard, in which we grow more conscious. I keep Rilke by my bedside, and I was reading the Book of Hours. And of course, when I'm working on a talk, everything's like, I can use it. Like, every poem is like, there it is, there it is. So I just took one. I love this line. He writes:

""I know that nothing has ever been real without my beholding it. All becoming has needed me. My looking ripens things and they come toward me to meet and be met.""

I know nothing has ever been real without my beholding it. All becoming has needed me. My ripening, my looking, my attention ripens things and they come toward me to meet and be met. The 10,000 things come forward as this self to be met.

This is why all of Buddha's teachings are considered to be skillful means. They are part of our refuge to protect us from ourselves and our lack of skill.

Daido also cautioned us in believing that we have all the answers as part of skillful means—that we know what is skillful for someone. And maybe you've been in that place where you think, I know what's best for you. Nene. Do we? Maybe. But I don't know. On the deepest level, we can present something, but we got to leave it open. We could say, this has worked for me and many others, but one has to drink it. We can be led. We all know this on some level.

So he said to be cautioned there, that we have the answers for someone else, or even that we know what is skillful. Skillful means can take years to initiate. We just practice it over and over, and then it starts getting skillful in and of itself. It's not skillful means. It takes my looking at it; it ripens it.

He also cautioned us against arrogance in that way, making someone disempowered with skillful means. Because we know Buddhist communities, and many continue to grapple with leaders claiming to be enlightened who say, I'm using skillful means, and taking advantage of their power dynamic. So there's that in history, in our Buddhist history, more recently, in fact. So skillful means isn't skillful on its own.

And Dido said, don't think we get into an attitude where you take your seat and you say, okay, do me. I'm sitting, meditating. So we actually have to—it needs us. Skillful means needs us. When the mind is free of attachment and delusions, its actions are effortlessly creative, boundless in expression, and perfectly tuned to the moment, just like the universe itself.

One of our students wrote a book on the Greek language, and in the beginning, she starts with one word on one page, and it's ""ginosko."" And it actually—it says, it means to come to know, the recognition of what is true by experience, because nothing can—this is written by, I'm not sure who—because nothing can be skillful means unless it has been associated with the earth. I like that. Nothing can be skillful means unless it's associated with the earth, unless it's occurred within our body; we're the earth.

We need to imagine and visualize and return to our body, heart, mind, to the earth, in and through it to find out what's true.

This one Buddhist teacher says we need to throw the word ""visualization"" out the window. It is the wrong word, because the word visualization implies something visual. It implies working with visual images, and it also implies working with the eyes. This is incorrect. Instead, we are working with the imagination. When we work with the imagination, we're not just working with imagined sights, but also with imagined sounds, smells, physical awareness, sensations, feelings, emotional feelings, and so on.

To affirm the pervasiveness of emptiness is to discover the fact there is no inherently existing self.

So that's what I got on imagination. I'll end with Daido's words. And also, I love this psychologist/analyst Marion Woodman, who was a Jungian analyst, and her favorite, I guess, phrase was: ""If we could allow the pace of our meetings to slow down to the pace of our hearts, we might find genuine understanding."" If we could allow the pace of our meetings with whatever we're meeting to slow down to the pace of our hearts, we might find genuine understanding.

And so how does that factor in with zazen? Zazen gives us that opportunity to strengthen that ability to slow down to the pace of our heart when we meet something, so we can understand, get genuine understanding throughout this whole earth.

Daido Roshi says, so please, when you practice anything skillfully, practice your life. Trust yourself completely. Trust the process of sitting. Know that deep within each and every one of us, under those layers of conditioning, there is an enlightened being, alive and well. In order to function, it needs to be discovered. To discover this Buddha is wisdom. To make it function in the world is compassion. It's not great if it's just emptiness. It's got to function. Otherwise it's not useful. We can't even do anything if it's emptiness. And emptiness isn't a thing. We can't even walk across the street. We got to come back in the world.

That wisdom, he says—to make it function in the world—is compassion. And that wisdom and compassion is the life of each one of us. It's the skillful means, the spontaneous creativity of the universe. It's up to you what you do with it.

Thank you. Thanks so much for listening.

The main case: A monastic bid farewell to Guizhong. Guizhong said to him, “Where are you going?” The monastic said, “I'm going to many places to study the five flavor Zen.” Guizhong said, “There is one flavor at my place.” The monastic said, “What is your one flavor Zen?” Guizhong hit him.

Good morning, everybody. Good morning to those of you here and those of you joining from home. Good afternoon, Amy and Ollie and Annie. Thank you for making this life possible. My name is Dayo. It's my pleasure to offer this short talk this afternoon as part of the Shuso service position.

I know that in my training here I found these mornings incredibly helpful. Some of you have already been slated to ask questions afterwards, but I really encourage you, if you're not on that list, to sort of get involved internally. How would you respond? What would you say? What would you ask? These live opportunities for training can really stay with us and feed our practice for years to come.

So with that being said, let's jump in with Guizhong and the departing monastic and let's try and make it about us. Close as many gaps as we can.

So, we go to one of the teachers and we tell them we're leaving. They say, “Well, where are you going?” Say, “Well, I'm off to get the five flavors Zen from a whole bunch of places.” Teacher tells us, “There's only one flavor here.” We ask them what that is. That's pretty simple. So why is a monastic, or anybody—why is anybody getting hit for simply expressing their desire to go get some teachings from some places?

This is from Master Yuanwu: “Ever since ancient times, people with the will for the path have traveled around from region to region seeking instruction from adept wayfarers. They truly did not let their lives in this world go by in vain. Thus they did their best to put their conditioned mind to rest and picked out teachers who genuinely possessed the enlightened eye. When they encountered such teachers, they put down their baggage and stayed for as long as necessary, relying on these adept teachers to help them complete the work.”

Master Dogen took a ship from Japan to China and back again and said, upon returning, “I return empty handed. The eyes are horizontal, the nose is vertical.” Now, that's some serious going around that Dogen got up to, and in one sense came back empty handed. So even the great Dogen traveled.

So if Yuanwu and Dogen's words carry some weight for us, we can move past the idea that going around is the issue. This sangha, our sangha, is from all over. You know, we go all over. Clearly, it's the mind that we do it with that's crucial and really the heart of this encounter.

So let's imagine after we finish today, we go outside in the field and we hear a little voice: “Oh, no. Oh no.” From the field, as we go over, the sky is lamenting, “I need to be more spacious. More spacious. Please help.” What would we try to explain to it? “What? You're the sky. You can't be more spacious or less spacious. How would you even do that? You're the sky.” What if it didn't change? Would we run around to demonstrate to it just how spacious it is? Get in a lawn mower and fly around in our compassion, our love for the sky? Would we resort to attempting to give it a whack, to demonstrate its remarkable spaciousness?

If we fill the sky with Canadian geese, could we diminish the sky's spaciousness? Or if we eradicated every cloud, mountain, tree, could we increase the sky's spaciousness? And then, if the sky came to its senses and went back to being, well, just the sky, would we say that it achieved spaciousness?

This example is me somewhat clumsily adapting a koan among cast. Seijo Daitsuchisho Buddha did zazen for ten kalpas, could not realize the highest truth and so could not become fully emancipated. Why was this? Seijo said, “Your question is a very appropriate one.” The monk would not put that down. They asked again, “Why did he not attain Buddhahood by doing zazen in the meditation hall?” Seijo replied, “Because he did not.”

We say that delusion is going around looking for a head to put on our own. That's how I'm interpreting this monastic's five flavor trip. Get something from each of those schools, something the monk thinks they need. Clearly, everything can be a flavor. We think we need a head to put on top of our own: a promotion at work, a new car. This robe can be a new head, a new flavor. “I'm a practitioner” can be a flavor. If I think I don't have it and I can get it from somewhere, it's another head, another flavor.

The delusion of desire is that me, a discrete, separate object, lacking something, thinks that more value is added to me because I get that thing that is currently outside me, or on the rejection side of delusion, that my value is somehow reduced if that object gets too close.

One of my boyhood heroes, Eric Cantona, said, “When seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.” Some of us end up living our whole lives as the sardine or the seagull or the trawler. What if we look beyond the foreground, the objects? Other options are available.

But this delusion process, we might say, is far more insidious than just an object acquiring objects and just occasionally rearranging them. It sometimes kind of seems quite benign, like the worst thing we might be is just a little bit hoarderish. But it's not like I get that thing, put it on a mantelpiece or a dusty attic, or if we're a bit fancy, it's not like I get that thing and put it in some sort of beautifully lit art gallery. It's not that sterile or innocent, because the thing isn't a thing. Whatever it is, whether it's an object or an idea or a part of my life, we have to make it into a thing every minute, every second.

It's like we kind of choose a piece of the water in the ocean and give it an arbitrary boundary. And we're not doing this once or twice a minute. This is multiple times a second. We have to use our mental energy and our life force to bring that object into being in our mind so we can attach it to this object, “me,” which we also have to make, naturally. Nothing is fixed and static.

So after we've made our important thing, given it a value, we have to use our mental energy to attempt to solidify it, either so that we can keep hold of it or to keep tabs on it, make sure it doesn't get too close. No wonder we're exhausted.

Ziyong, a nun from around ninth-century China, said, “The pine tree does not envy the plum. That is the practice.” Well, this process of objectifying, fixing, holding, we might say, is really honest because we're just responding to our fears. We probably all have this. You know, I certainly grew up in an environment where the message was: there is not enough. You're not enough. You have to compete. Individuals compete, groups compete, nations compete. Some people even tell us that's completely natural. It's just human nature. They say, “It's me against the world.” And that is so often reality-defining, scary.

An oft quoted koan is Zhaozhou's oak tree. A monk asked him, “Why did Bodhidharma come from the West?” Zhaozhou answered him, “The oak tree in the front garden.” What? Bodhidharma wasn't competing. He wasn't solving a problem, just an oak tree in the front garden. Was Zhaozhou so far ahead, in so much luxury, that he could afford to give a seemingly absurd answer? What is he pointing to?

I can totally relate to this monk trying to work out Bodhidharma's intention. If I know his motivation, I can sort of like transpose that onto my situation and I'll do the thing that will get me ahead. I might not do it as smoothly as old Bodhidharma, but it'll get me somewhere. And the answer comes back to me: the oak tree in the garden. Sorry.

Mumon's poem in the Gateless Gate for this koan reads:  
Words do not express fact.  
Phrases do not reveal the delicate motion of the mind.  
Those who accept words are lost.  
Those who adhere to phrases are deluded.

Why? Why does adhering to and accepting words and phrases leave me lost and deluded? Why did Guizhong perform such an extraordinary act of striking someone? Because they seemed a bit attached to five flavors of words and phrases. Is the hit extreme?

Responding to our fear, we wind up fixing everything. This is this. That is that. This is how things are to me. Everything gets solidified. You might say we turn the world to stone. Well, this is really quite dangerous. As soon as we look under the hood a little bit, as soon as something comes along that has more value—and it most certainly will, because in our desperation we'll create it—we'll dispose of the less valuable thing. This thing here might be me, you, that group, that nation, those trees, that ocean.

This is a huge part of our “beyond fear of differences” work. Is there merit in finding the courage of not knowing each other, not fixing each other in place, not giving each other a value? Not knowing? The quote “not knowing is most intimate”—we see that over and over again in the teachings. Is it hyperbole to say that not fixing things in place, not knowing ourself, not knowing things, might be a question of life and death?

Hojin Sensei, over and over through the years when I've gone into dokusan room with a problem, has always said to me, and I'm sure to many of us, to simply get curious, take a look. That's pretty powerful. Just take a look. You know that monster under the bed relies on us not looking under the bed. If we get a little bit curious, just poke even half an eyeball down there—wait a second.

We might have all come here because we were, or are to a decent amount, turning it to stone. So what is it when we get curious? This is from the verse:  
The Great Way is vast and all-pervading.  
If you direct yourself toward it, you move away from it.  
So is there just like one Great Way flavor? And we've got to get ourselves at the perfect distance from it, not moving towards, not moving away?

The Great Way moves. We move. Do we have to be like flamingos dancing perfectly in line, perfectly in synchronization? There's us and the Great Way doing this dance forevermore. Daido Roshi's commentary to this koan says, “The principle cannot be grasped within words and ideas.” When we hear the words “one flavor,” we're almost certainly going to create a thing out of this oneness. Maybe we conceive of a homogenous pink-beige mass, probably with a little bit of glitter. It's got to be a little bit special, right? Guizhong hits. It's hard to keep telling our fairy tales when that hit fills the heavens.

So is it just a case of balancing the two sides of each idea? The student says five or many, so Guizhong says one. Is he just trying to get the monastic to see the other side of the coin? And the middle way isn't a halfway point. It's not two and a half flavors. “Think neither good nor evil,” doesn't mean to position ourselves in the just-about-okay middle. It's not sitting on a fence, never doing anything for fear of tipping the scales one way or the other.

We might say the middle way is the absence of falling into this or that, just letting go of measuring by abandoning the scales altogether. Abandoning the scales, the measuring stick, can, in my experience, be incredibly terrifying because it seems like we're giving up the mechanism that we think our entire life rests on—getting that thing I don't have, keeping that other thing that I don't want away.

Kim Euryeop, a Korean nun who just passed away maybe about 50 years ago, said, “The more I threw away, the more I became. My body, my name, even my opinions—those were only shadows pretending to be me.” So when things are getting solid, we've got to find a way to fray the edges of those constructed solids, shake things loose a little.

I've always found nature a pretty willing helper in this when I've needed a bit of shaking loose. Ed Yong—he wrote a book called Immense World about how animals perceive the world. He's got innumerable examples of this. It's very enlightening for this. You know, that we used to think animals were this. Then we discovered they're far more remarkable than we ever gave them credit for.

So for apparently years, and until relatively recently, folks in Europe thought that swallows in the winter, because obviously they disappeared, they thought that swallows burrowed down into the mud in the bottom of ponds. And then a scientist and a team of scientists, they started getting reports of these tagged swallows in Africa.

We'll fast forward a few “oh wow” moments now. It seems obvious, right, that instead of burrowing into the mud under ponds every year, swallows make this remarkable five or six thousand mile migration. They must have some pretty good batteries on their phones to guide them all the way, right? Well, now I can see swallows a little fresher. The edges of that thing I call a swallow don't have to be fixed. I can leave a door, maybe a window, maybe a whole wall open for them. When the edges of mind's facts fray, they start to breathe a little. When they can move, they can be fluid. Then we don't need to worry whether it's a question of one or five, this or that, striving or not striving.

Yuanwu says, “Rootless, but finding life.”

A few years ago, I was watching a documentary. It was about Eliud Kipchoge. He's becoming the first person, at least that we know of, to run a marathon in under two hours. It's a really wonderful watch and it's quite fascinating for me from a practice point of view.

Firstly, Kipchoge just seems like the kind of person you might consider just taking up running, just to spend a bit of time around. He's warm, determined, and sort of a part of him seems to be operating in a field that we can't quite see. And part of the documentary is it shows two different running clubs or training camps. One camp, you know, I'll sort of disparagingly call them the Clipboard and Computers camp. You know, it's very structured. The athletes have their striving measured out for them. “Run at this pace.” The coach tells them, “At age 15, you should be capable of this, 19, this.” You know, it's a little bit unkind, but machines. I thought those guys must be a great big bundle of “I.”

The Kipchoge Club. They just, they just seem to—the whole, I don't know, there's this massive group of people just goes out running. The junior runners are just running with the professionals. Those junior runners just ran when they could keep up, they could. And when they didn't, they didn't. There was no one telling them what was possible, who they should be, how they should measure themselves.

Artists maybe, when they're running so freely, are they striving to run? Are they not striving to run? Now, I think I'm taking a huge artistic license and projecting what I wanted to see. But it did strike me that if you want to run freely, and therefore presumably quickly, it's really helpful to be free as you're doing it.

This is again from Yuanwu: “If you can be free and clear in actual practice for a long time, naturally you will come to meet the source on all sides and become unified and whole right before your eyes. It has always been that if you don't know it in your daily life, where then will you look for it? Better find out.”

And finally, Hojin Sensei turned me onto this quote from: “Just resting is like the great ocean accepting hundreds of streams, all absorbed into one flavor. Freely going ahead is like the great surging tides riding on the wind, all coming onto this shore together. How could they not reach into the genuine source?”

There is a verse about this case. I requested that Kaiku read it.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you direct yourself to, you move away from it.  
For the mind unified with the way, all striving ceases.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you direct yourself to, you move away from it.  
For the mind unified with the way, all striving ceases.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you direct yourself toward it, you move away from it.  
For the mind unified with the way, all striving ceases.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you direct yourself toward it, you move away from it.  
For the mind unified with the way, all striving ceases.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you dare direct yourself toward it, you move away from it.  
For the mind unified with the way, all striving ceases.

The Great Way is vast and all pervading.  
If you direct yourself to it, you move away from the inexhaustible lion's roar.

How will you use this shep, freely giving life and taking it away? This is a 3-foot long brown snake. A long time ago, it had become a campora flower. On Mount Gudhakutra and on Mount Sharon, it had become a plum blossom. Sometimes it transforms into a dragon and swallows heaven and earth. Sometimes it transforms into a diamond sword with the freedom to kill and give life. Right now, in accord with the order of my teacher, it lies in my hands. I feel like a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. However, being assigned Chief Disciple, I have to fulfill my duties now.

You dragons and elephants in this Dharma Hall. Confront me in Dharma Encounter. Kaiku, you go first.

Attention. I have always been taken with this idea of striving because, well, striving brought me here. Striving gave me a career. Striving in many ways worked for me. So how and why should I give up striving?

He started by saying, “Taken by the idea of striving, may your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.”

Attention. Give me a wave. Where are you? Hello. My dog's afraid of motorcycles. Sometimes she and I hold her, and sometimes I comfort her and I pet her. And sometimes I shout at her, “Stop it.” I even kicked her once. Is the hit the right action for the monk? Not because it's a hit, but how do you come from the place where it's not the habit?

What is your dog's name? Rosa. Rosa. Could you share a little bit about Rosa, briefly? Say it again? Could you share briefly a little about Rosa? Found her on the street in Mexico. She loops up in a circle when she sleeps. And she thinks that motorcycles are terrible. And sometimes she just—she looks at me. When one passes and I look at her, there's no reaction at all. You just never know.

She sounds quite wonderful. Avalokiteshvara perceives the cries of the world. And so compassion is shown in all its many forms. May your life go well. Thank you for your hand.

Attention. Shuso. What is your one flavor Zen? Approaching the altar: shashu. Departing the altar: gassho. May your life go well. Thanks for your answer.

Attention. In a world with so many different flavors, so to speak, it can seem almost like an infinite number of flavors, especially in just contemporary society. I find myself thinking, how do we engage with that? How do we be in that without getting carried away or without rejecting it completely, completely disengaging from society?

Why do you need to disengage? Why do you need to reject? If you don't want a strawberry ice cream, right? You don't sit at home all afternoon going, “Get away, strawberry ice cream.” May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

Attention, Shuso. The world seems to have meter sticks baked into it—like, seems to have meter sticks baked into it, part of everything we do. How do we let go of that in a world that seems to demand it?

What is this world? Teaching, helping. But where does that will come from? Is it just there? How does it get there? Well, society creates rules, things that we need to do. And then you... May your life go well. Thank you for your answer.

Attention. Shuso, when I'm sitting zazen and directing my mind towards not adding anything to what's there, it seems like I'm directing my mind even if I'm not, and my mind is not. And it seems like there needs to be some form of striving or directing or right effort. It's part of the Eightfold Path. I... I'd like to experience or do. I don't know. I want to make right effort. How do I do that when it's not towards something?

Your service position was a server this week, right? Yeah. How did you serve? You. You actually don't need to use any words. Just show this anger. How did you serve? Sorry to confine you. I mean, I thank the people I serve. Sometimes I didn't serve. Sometimes I served. Did a condiment tray of sugar and peanut butter magically appear in front of myself and Shugen Roshi? Yeah, I guess so. A wonderful bodhisattva just served. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

Attention. Shuso, Hojin—you talked of how she encouraged curiosity. When you come with a problem, can you share some of what you've learned so far about bringing yourself to curious? And if you like, cite things you've seen in your teachers and Dharma sisters and brothers.

What is your motivation for asking the question? I actually don't quite understand the question, it's quite long. What is your... When you get beneath the surface of that, what do you want out of this response? What's your motivation?

Learn more about when I'm really upset with negative emotions, how I get to the place of curious. I have some skill at that and want to continue to learn about that.

Okay. So I'm wondering for you this morning, Alexandra, for the benefit of few of you who didn't hear, she said—paraphrasing—Alexandra, resisting is really tempting. We have somehow... This is a point for not the middle way. We somehow have to get that fire going in us that we tip the scales 1% more “I want to wake up” than “I want to go to sleep.” So when I'm in pain, god damn it, I did that again, I hurt my Dharma sister. I can't do that. May your life go well. Thank you for teaching.

Attention. Yep. Coming from tasting five flavors, knowing there's one. I don't... How do you commit to that? How do you step into that? How do you throw off the meter stick when all you—all I think I know is five flavors?

When you're eating mango, mango. You're eating strawberry, strawberry. How many is that? Mango. May your life go well. Thank you for your answer.

Attention. So this—why didn't the monk taste what he'd just eaten? Same old. He's leaving, he's been there, he's been eating, he's asking, “What flavor is this?” Why doesn't he know?

Yeah, that's a good question. Society does it to us. No, I don't know. I don't know how I came by this conditioning. Having spent a little bit of time around people who've walked down this path a few more steps, I can see, wait, what are they doing? What are they being that I'm not, somehow. So I don't know why sometimes or anyone sees or what anyone doesn't see. All I know is that I do want to see. I can't control it. When I put plants in the ground, I just try and give them the best soil possible. I can't control the flowers. May your life go well. Thank you for your answer.

Attention. I've heard you say a couple times, “I want to see and I want to wake up.” Yeah. And to hold that without striving. We have a Buddha on the altar. It's not nothing. How do we strive to not strive? How do you not strive to not strive while not having an empty altar?

This is running as much as I can with the fan and the stick. This is running. If I start commentating, oh, my Lord, I'm going to run through treacle. Just run. Just practice. Don't worry whether you're striving or not striving. May your life go well.

Attention. Shuso, how do I know it's striving or how do I know if I just really care? You know, when I'm a perfectionist and I feel like part of it comes from feeling like, not good enough and, and coming from this culture and the society of scarcity and, and, and just making us feel like, making me feel like I'm constantly lacking. Right. But then in Buddhism, you know, the paramitas are like the perfections. And so sometimes, like, I'm straightening out all the zafus and the zabutons after we sit and, and, and, and I see the perfectionist in me, you know, and is it, am I striving for something? Am I competing here or is there genuine compassion? I just really care. So how do you know the difference?

So you're straightening the cushions. Yes. Then you start having a nice little conversation about it with yourself. And then, and then what's next? I straighten the next cushion. May your life go well. For your answer.

Attention. There's a time for staying. But sometimes the staying is comfortable and it feels good and it's not really working and it's time to leave. There's a time for leaving when it's not working and it's hard and, and you need to do something else. How do you know? How do you know when it's the time?

Another way we might say, why didn't that monastic taste? Why didn't they know? In one sense, it sounds kind of harsh, but I'll make it about me. When I don't know whether to stay or go, when I don't taste, I've kind of got my hands around my own throat now. What can I do at that point? Either I jump or I try and loosen the grip, or someone comes along and gives me a whack. I haven't really answered you there. Let's keep talking about that. I feel like that's a good question. I didn't really meet that. May your life go well. Thank you for your answer.

Attention. So there's a lot of hitting and things in the koans, and we don't do that anymore for the most part. But there's a sense of urgency and a directness that's conveyed. So if you were the teacher, how would you convey that sense of urgency, that directness? And how do you know? What is that hit? What is that hit?

When we let go of it being a hit, what is it? It's contact. It's right now. When we let go of it being a hit. May your life go well.

Attention. Shuso. Congratulations on being a senior monastic. Where are you going? On Skegness Beach, I took a ride on a donkey. May your life go well.

Attention. Attention. Shuso, from the moment I've gotten here, I've wanted to get out. And yet here I am. How has it been for you, Rusty Nail? May your life go well. Thank you for teaching. May your life go well.

Being immature and insufficient in training, I wasn't expecting to be assigned as chief disciple. I feel as if a crime has been committed that fills the heaven. There isn't a place on earth for me to hide. I hope that there's enough water in the Esopus for you to rinse my words out of your ears. Water flows and returns to the sea.

Well done, Shuso. Well done.

To Shuso Daio, this is like a mountain returning home. Cultivating a spring to share, to give you. Planting thousands of flower seeds in the winter greenhouse. Sitting in the brightness of awareness and putting among sympathetic black dope. Days and night passing, your eyes were watching and caring. Your fingers are connecting and responding. Look. Wow. In the opened empty field, born the 10,000 baby spring. Arms and hands dancing, shining, touching our spirits. Sealed window. Knocking, knocking. The monk, go open the windows. First time of the year we were sitting and you say, “Today the zendo's windows are open because spring is here.” But now we find and feel our spring in here. It's because somewhere inside of us opened. And that is not a small thing. Congratulations for you, Shuso.

Oh, what a path you have planted here. Greeting friends old and new. A bright evolution. One season to the next, one year to the next. What ease and brightness you bring in such smiling spring color. Stately red and violet columbine. Subtle toned hellebore. Joyful bursts of purple allium. What generosity you offer the Sangha. Each tiny seed at a time. Who knows what colors will blossom next. Congratulations, Shuso.

Did the mouse really say “olay” as it ran past you? The alliums stand proud while the foxgloves burst into laughter. Your warmth is infectious. We watch as the blue heron takes an eternity to reach the other rock. “Let's remain in this timelessness together,” you say. With you, the world feels vast and boundless. Congratulations.

Su Dayo, a question. How come you planted so many flowers? Rows and beds of flowers. Do you love how they dance in the spring breeze? Do you love how the pollinators arrive hungry with joy? Or do you love us? Love this mountain? It's simply what a flowering heart does. Thank you, Shuso.

Congratulations for Dayo. Just like a fish jumping out of the water, suddenly a net leaping free, spreading out over the entire ocean. A day comes, a heart. Open. Land ho. Best wishes for the day. Love you.

High or low, dirt, digging in the dirt. Shuso, I see your smile. Uplifting children or simply being like a child, leading the wayward, guarding the true. Your staff is barely visible amidst the poppies and foxglove. Completely lost inside that good field protector Arhat. Or maybe just a regular guy gone mad in the springtime with the love of it all. Congratulations for Dayo.

Fierce dancing flames licking the night sky. How did it become so strong? Mystery is the fuel, with a bit of British humor thrown in the mix. Burning, burning ever brighter, warming the bones of the Sangha. Congratulations, Shuso, for Dayo.

Oh, the flowers. Who knew they could show so much Monarda? Modeling vulnerability, the courage of columbine, alliums tall and straight, sincere, the sneezeweed wise beyond its name, echinacea exudes enthusiasm. And when those poppies pop, they will fill the world with love. Congratulations, Shuso.

For Dayo. His heart melds with silent blossoms the same day they scatter in the wind. Mountain walking, mountain tasting loves, mountain training, loving, mountain blooming. How many flavors deepen in this spring drizzle?

It seems that you have a reputation, Dayo. One mountain, one flavor, one great response. How is it? When springtime finally calls, there is someone who gives loving attention to the many blooming flowers. And because of this, this joy just cannot be contained.

This is from the Book of Serenity: Sun Sheng's Golden Fish.

Meeting the strong, be weak; meeting the soft, be hard. If both are hard and meet each other, there will surely be one damaged. But tell me, how do you interchange?

San Sheng asked Xuefeng, “The golden fish that's passed through the net, what does it use for food?” Xuefeng said, “When you come out of the net, I'll tell you.” Sun Sheng said, “The teacher of 1,500 people, yet you don't even know a saying.” Xuefeng said, “My tasks as abbot are many.”

Verse: When first ascending, the tears of waves, clouds and thunder accompany leaping up magnificently. Look at the great function. With a burnt tail he clearly crosses the gate of view. The beautiful fish won't agree to be sunk in a pickle jar. An old, mature person does not startle the crowd. Someone used to facing a great adversary has no fear from the start. Floating, floating, just as light as five ounces. Massive, massive, heavier than even a thousand tons. Sancheng's exalted fame over the four seas—who again was his peer? Xuefeng stands alone. The eight winds blowing do not move him. The ship is coming into harbor.

I always have this sense image of On Go as a ship setting, sailing the beginning and now 45 years on Mount Tremper. In Buddhist geologic terms, we're barely through the birth canal. But in terms of life here on Mount Tremper, it is something I hope there will be a 90th, 100th anniversary—think about that hundredth anniversary. We'll have to come back and shake some bones, see what's going on.

I remember watching “The Rock Grow,” that very special, very simple, very early video that Daido Roshi did for the 10th anniversary. And in that he was talking about the future. People were always trying to get him to say what was going to be happening in 15 years, 20 years. He said, “I don't know, I'm not a prophet.” But he talked about the Eight Gates, and he said, “Look, if they continue to be useful, then I hope that, you know, the teachers in the future will continue to use them. If they're not, then they should let them go.” And I remember really being struck by that because those coming into formation, being brought out in the book—that book that was really important at that time—was kind of represented something, you know, a kind of coming together of the articulation of this training that he was developing with us together and talking about the lay and monastic paths.

He used to talk about that a lot in the beginning, how he wanted them both to have full integrity and be different. He didn't want them to be blurry. And then he would say, “Well, you know, if we don't need this anymore, then we should let it go, you know, and use what's needed at that time.” It reminded me of Egyoku, who was a long, long time student of Maezumi Roshi’s and a teacher—she was the abbot of Los Angeles for some time. She told the story that in the early years, she was fretting over ZCLA and their finances. It was early years and they didn't have much, and she went to him and said, “Roshi, I don't know how we're going to do this.” He said, “It's okay, it's okay. If we have to let go of the center, we let it go. The sangha will still practice.” I was struck by that too—you know, putting so much effort into developing, finding, establishing, growing a center, and him, leading that sangha, saying very freely, “If we can't do this here, we'll let it go. It's not in the building.”

These mountains and rivers of the present are the actualization of the word of the ancient Buddhas. Each abiding in its own dharma state completely fulfills its virtues. I think that those are some of the most beautiful words spoken.

Mountain training. Dogen speaks of mountain training. To deeply study the word of the ancient Buddhas. And to study the word is to study the body and mind of the Buddha's ancestors—to make them our own body and mind. It's intimate, it's personal. That's why we have to get in close. To study the self within this body and mind, to study the perceived self in others. What is it? Is it to free ourselves? Simple words: to free ourselves. To free ourselves from the net that shows up in all kinds of ways. And the problem with that net is when we find ourselves entangled in it, it's not enough to just be tangled—we throw it onto others. We kind of can't not do that; we kind of can't not have an influence. And we influence each other with ourselves. And if that self is caught and deluded and angry or greedy, then that's the net we toss out. If it's clear and kind and compassionate, then that's the net.

Meeting the strong, be weak; meeting the soft, be hard. Of course, strong and weak can mean all kinds of things. There's social conditioning, gender conditioning, historical narratives about what is strong, what is weak, what is soft, what is hard. And we absorb it, and then we bring that into practice. And so to really understand and begin to experience what is real strength, what is true weakness—he's saying, when meeting the strong, be weak. We tend to think of weakness as a fault, as something we want to avoid. He's saying, no, employ weakness. So what is that? Meeting the soft—to be hard, to be pliant, to develop pliancy, suppleness. To think of that as a trait, as a quality, as a virtue, something that we're trying to develop.

That's why we have to keep meeting so many different situations, circumstances, as practitioners—a pliant mind and body—so that we can meet the needs of ourselves, of others. You know, I think about what is the allure, what is the seduction of a dictator? You know, somebody who knows all the answers, somebody who's going to take care of you, right? Make it all right. I don't have to think, I don't take responsibility. I just follow. But it has no fixed form. And so we have to practice letting go of the sense of a fixed form in anything in training, which can seem kind of odd since there is attention to detail—the way we hold a bell, the way we strike a bell, the way we unfold our bowls, the way we have meal, the way we enter the zendo. It can seem a lot about adhering to a form. That's not what it's about. It's finding pliancy, spaciousness, flexibility, freedom in a form. Right? If we're not walking in this way, we'll be walking some other way—to be conscious, intentional.

I think of wind. Huineng, having received the robe and bowl, was met by Monk Ming, who wanted to take it back. He was angry, he was righteous. Who is this nobody who had taken the Fifth Ancestor's robe? And Huineng just placed it on the rock and said, “This was given in faith. You can't take it by force. Take it. I leave it to you.” Meeting the hard, be soft. Or was it Monk Ming who was actually soft? Who was in a state of a kind of weakness? And in Huineng's pliancy, he met something impenetrable, such that he couldn't lift the robe.

I think of Deshan coming down in his ripe old age, who had been a very strong, fierce teacher, coming down for oryoki. And the tenzo says, “Where are you going, old man? Drum hasn't sounded. It's not time yet.” And Deshan just turns around and goes back. Very simple. But the student working on that koan has to enter into that mind. What's happening right there? What is that mind?

If both are hard and they meet each other, there will surely be one damaged. How to interchange, how to weave, how to move amidst and intermingle? I think zazen is the epicenter of where we discover these things. You know, I was meeting with One Continuous Thread, some of the folks who met last night, and one of the things I was talking about was that in zazen, like in life, we’ve got to deal with things—situations, people, circumstances, work. We have to. Things arise, we often have to respond, a response is needed. Zazen is like the place where you don't have to do that, you don't have to fix it. You're not there to manage, we're not here to control it, we're not here to make it right, to correct it. All of those things. The one place, the one time—if it's ever going to happen before we're dead and it's too late—is zazen. Because you don't need to do that. In fact, you're specifically being asked and given permission to not do that. Just meet. Just meet.

If it's too hard, it breaks; too soft, there's no vitality. Shawn yesterday talked about the gate, the eight gates. What is a gate? Those of us who've entered into formal training, you know it's not just about putting on a robe or doing tangaryo or these other important things. Entering into training, entering the mountain gate. We were talking the other day about how nice it would be if we had a more traditional front gate, which is usually a very significant piece of architecture. It's big, you have to walk through it. And there are deities, guardian deities, fierce deities—you have to walk through them. You have to pass through that gauntlet. They're there to protect, they're there to burn off the unnecessary, they're there to turn away those who are not actually sincere. We'd have to do some serious reconfiguring out there to make that work. So we have two little puppies, but don't mess with them. They're small, but they're mighty.

San Sheng was a student of a successor of Linji—the Linji lineage—and Deshan was a student of Xuefeng, so these were very different lineages, 9th century. And one day, a student asked Xuefeng, “What is it if my fundamentally correct eye sometimes goes astray because of my teacher?” Xuefeng says, “You haven't yet met Bodhidharma.” And the student says, “Well, where is my eye?” Xuefeng says, “You're not going to get it from your teacher.” Thank goodness. Thank goodness. But don't over-rely on that. Don't over-rely on others. He's saying, don't over-rely on your teacher. In other words, in entering the training, implicit in this is you are trusted to find out. You are being trusted to find out, not only because there is no other way, but actually being trusted, which means you have the capacity. You don't entrust somebody with something they're not capable of doing. That's not kind.

Another student, another time, asked Xuefeng, “What is it when one is solitary and independent?” And Xuefeng said, “Still sick, not yet healed, not yet fully alive. Don't over-rely on oneself.” So here's Anxian as Xuefeng with this golden fish. It's often used as an image of an enlightened being that swims upstream like salmon and leaps over waterfalls to get to the place of its searching. And so this golden fish that has passed through the net, what does it use for food?

There are several koans that talk about what is it before enlightenment—Qimen, I think, said, “Lotus flower.” What about after, “Lotus leaves”? We want to know, right? What is it before? But we're most interested in what is it after. How is it after I pass through this net? Tell me that story. The net of greed and anger, pride, jealousy—you name it. You have your own list. But now what do you use for food? What is passing through? What is the path? What is a gate? A gate of entry. A gate is something that can block our passage if it's locked, if it won't open, if we don't know the key, the code, the combination—it won't let us pass. And so it's a fitting image, right? Because it often seems that we cannot pass. We cannot pass through. There's something we're not able to pass through.

We practice. The mind is distracted, distracted. It starts to calm. It calms, and then there's a moment—many moments—where there's nothing arising, but there still seems to be something there, something in between, a veil, a screen, something that seems to be obstructing, but you can't see anything. How do you pass through that? How do you let go there? And so Buddhism speaks about a path passing through a thicket of brambles. If you've ever walked through the woods, the nice thing about being on a trail is the trail is cut for you, right? It is cut through the brambles, so you don't have to deal with them, you just walk. But a true path isn't like that. It's sort of like somebody cuts a trail as they're walking the path, but as soon as they pass through, it all grows back in, right? So when you encounter it, you have to do the same thing. And if you've ever walked through a tangle of rhododendron, for instance—it's called the hiker's nightmare—it’s almost impossible.

There's a river of samsara, right, that we have to cross over. Paramita, prajna-paramita—crossing over to the other shore. So these images, these metaphors, this sense of traveling, of moving from somewhere to somewhere else, which is accurate and inaccurate at the same time.

And so normally for many, we're motivated by what the Buddha spoke of in the First Noble Truth: dukkha. Right? It's coming in loud and clear, almost enough to get our attention. And so that's a great motivator. It's a strong motivator because it hurts, it's painful, it's exhausting, it's confusing—it's all of that stuff. And so we can either ignore it, deny it, numb ourselves, or distract ourselves. And Lord knows there are ample opportunities for that. But for some, it just keeps getting through all that. That doesn't work anymore. And so that can be a very good motivator.

What happens often, in a sense naturally—you might even say necessarily—is that as practice continues, a lot of those brambles, those thickets, those obstacles begin to resolve, drop away. They don't show up, they don't appear in the same way. They're not so strong. You don't get so hooked. Pliancy, freedom.

And what often happens, I've seen, is that students sometimes will get lost there because that sort of very long-standing, familiar motivation is not the same, right? The fire may still be there, burning your ass a little bit, but it's not this raging fire. And so oftentimes I see students really kind of wander. They're not quite sure what is motivating their practice now. And in a way, it's a place where some people can see what really are they looking for, what are they motivating. Sometimes that's enough, that's sufficient—their life is better, demonstrably. That's a good thing. They're living better lives, they're kinder people, they're happier, they're more contented, things are working, and maybe that's really sufficient. But for others, it's not—there's still something that has not been addressed, that is not yet clear.

It's sort of like, you know, working very diligently to get to that door—you know, not everybody read Narnia. I didn't, but I kind of figured it out. Yeah. I wasn't reliant upon you having read Narnia. Oh. I really felt like I took that personally. I really felt, I felt like I was the only one who hadn't read it. I'm so sorry. But it's like working to get to this door, you know, that has seemed far away, impossible, maybe never. And then there it is, and you open this door and it's just, you stand there, it's like, “Oh, this is good.” And then you just sit down and have a barbecue. It's like, no—step forward. The way is open now, more clear.

So having passed through the net, what does the fish now use for food? And Xuefeng says, “When you come out, then I'll tell you.” The footnote says only say 30% for the time being. Why? Why only 30%? The Buddha made a point over and over again about how he wasn't tight-fisted, which meant he had taught what there was for him to teach. He didn't hold anything back. He didn't conceal, he didn't harbor, he didn't—he gave it all away. So why only 30%?

Xuefeng says, “I'll tell you later,” saying too little. The precept on not being withholding really refers to the Dharma—not being withholding, not being stingy with the Dharma. It doesn't mean go out and convert people, doesn't mean tell everybody everything you think you know. Don't be a big-mouth Buddha person. It means when somebody's asking, when somebody wants to know, and you have something that you can offer, you have experience, you're meditating. So why only 30%? Saying too little can not meet the needs of the person. Saying too much can ruin their meal. Very important, very important principle. Say too much—Daido Roshi used to say it robs something essential from the student. It is not trusting them. 

How can we learn to use our minds deeply, well, if we haven't learned how to think? Now, that might seem strange, because in a sense, we are taught, in a way, how to think, but maybe not. Actually, we're taught a lot about what to think, what should we think about, but are we taught how to think? That's just sort of taken for granted—you have a mind, you have thoughts, you know how to think. We know how to have thoughts. But do we know how to think, how to use this power? So we have to learn how to think. Well, how do we do that? Well, first we have to shut up—I say that respectfully. We have to give it up a bit, learn how not to think for a moment and realize, oh, we have that capacity. You have that capacity. It's a natural capacity. And then from that place, we begin to discover how to think.

How can we meet adversity if we haven't experienced adversity, if we haven't met difficulties and discovered their inner workings? And not just anywhere, everywhere, randomly, at a loss, but met adversities within the context of practice, the way, the path—training in a way to meet adversities that are very simple, ordinary. Nobody's trying to make your life difficult here. Actually, the whole point is to make it easier. But it's rigorous, right? And so we meet these small, little bitty adversities. They don't always feel that way, right? Admittedly. But in the landscape of the world, they're workable. And within that, within this, can we trust them? You're not the only one getting up before four o'clock. You're not the only one sitting silent. You're not the only one facing your—the mind, right? And so can we trust those adversities and within this context, practice them?

I remember Open Sozan many years ago, and a person who'd been practicing for quite a number of years said that every sesshin they always experienced pain—there's always, you know, very obstructing, very difficult. And this sesshin they decided they would really try and practice what the teachings say, really use it to really concentrate their mind, go into the pain. And then they spoke about how transformative that was, which was wonderful. And meanwhile, I'm thinking, just now, just now you're doing that. Bravo. And maybe earlier—we each have to come at the time we're ready.

How can we meet pain and suffering in others if we haven't met our own? How can we really cultivate compassion, alleviating suffering, if we haven't met and alleviated our own?

Xuefeng says, “When you come out of the net, I'll tell you.” Is he holding back? Is he withholding from Sun Sheng? Is he going right into Sun Sheng's belly and meeting him there?

The commentary says, Sun Sheng, imposing this question, undeniably set out a bowl of glue in a forest of thorns—a place to get stuck. Xuefeng at first is 30 steps away, watching you, looking in yourself, and drawing out yourself. It's a very interesting image he creates. Xuefeng is 30 steps away, watching you as you ask this question, looking in yourself, trying to draw out yourself. And so he says, “Wait till you come out of the net, and then I'll tell you.” Strange.

It's just like a national champion of chess, playing first, looking several moves ahead before they make their move. You know, it's presented as very strategic, like very calculated. I don't think it's like that. It's much more natural, spontaneous, immediate.

And San Sheng says, “The teacher of 1,500 people, and you don't even know a saying. You can't respond. You can't offer a teaching.” The commentary says, San Sheng, seeing that at this stage victory and defeat are not distinguished, goes by a different road—sees that this is not about victory and defeat. This is not about who knows and who does not know. And that's one of the beautiful things about the koan—it presents what sounds like a very ordinary conversation. Xuefeng knows, San Sheng doesn't. San Sheng's in the net, he doesn't really understand. When he comes out, Xuefeng will tell him, right? That's the obvious point—except it's not. They're having the same words, but they're having a different conversation. They're meeting each other. Sun Sheng, seeing this, goes a different way. And so he says, “You're the teacher of 1,500 people. You don't even know what to say.” Using the tooth and nail of the cave of Dharma, the commentary says, Sun Sheng captured him alive. And so Xuefeng, honest and sincere, just said, “My tasks as abbot are many.” Is he just complaining? Is he weary of this conversation, just wanted to be over? Are they meeting?

What is passing through the net? It's a path, right? So there has to be a sense of movement, progression, traveling, going through different landscapes, right? It's not static, it's not stuck, it's moving. In fact, the Doshinji code says there needs to be progress, which is very interesting. You might not have seen that little phrase in the Doshinji code, right? What does that mean? What would a person, a practitioner here in sesshin, in residency, practicing regularly, have to do to not move anywhere along the path? Think about it—what would they have to do? They would have to be not practicing in a very deliberate and demonstrative way, of course. There are many times where we feel like we're not moving, we're stuck, we're not developing, we're not getting what we want, we're not experiencing what we should be—all of that. But to actually not make progress doesn't mean not changing, because not changing is not a possibility.

And so that's why that part of the Doshinji code is ever invoked: “This is not working for you because you have made no progress whatsoever.” I don't think so. Okay, we will not name names here. Just plant the seed of doubt—who could that be?

What is Zen? What is training? What is selflessness? What is true compassion? Sit, train, practice for three years, five years, thirty years. Then I'll tell you. Ryokan said, “When you know my poems are not poetry, then we can have a discussion about poetry.” Does that mean—it seems to imply—does that mean that we just sort of live in confusion for three years, five years, twenty years, thirty years, and then the doors open? Of course not. Is that what you've seen?

I've told this story about once when I went into dokusan during a sesshin in a moment of some frustration, and I was complaining about, “I don't think I'm getting anywhere, nothing is changing, blah blah blah, complain, complain, complain, nothing is working.” And Daido Roshi looked at me and just went…rang the bell. “That must be hard. Must be hard being you.” Which of course just got me really pissed off, right? I wanted to go right back in and argue for all the ways and things, all the ways things have changed.

What is this path? I was thinking about when Gmon and I drive down to North Carolina to see my family. We leave the Catskills, we follow the mountains—Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina. Go through all these landscapes—villages, towns, cities—changing landscapes, weather patterns. We're moving, we're traveling. And at each point along the way, every point along the way is complete. It's a place, people live there. It's got history, right? It is complete with everything that life needs. At every point along the way, it abides within its own state. And we are moving closer to what? Well, if we're going to the property where my family lives in North Carolina, then the analogy fails, right? Because you do—there is no property of enlightenment. But if my destination is returning home, my first home, my birth home, my origin—where is that exactly? How will I know when I get there? Is it the hospital where I was born? Is it the house I grew up in? Is it where my heart beats the loudest? There are sights and smells, sounds—when we roll across the border into North Carolina, I have a little ritual: I put in the Allman Brothers and I turn it up loud. Oh yeah.

A student asked Changsha, “Where are you coming from?” Changsha said, “From wandering in the mountains.” The student says, “Where did you go?” Changsha said, “Well, first I went pursuing fragrant grasses and then I came back along the falling flowers.” And the student said, “How very much like the sense of springtime.” Where did he get to? Did he arrive there? How do we hold this? It's not a duality—that's the short answer. We can say it's not a place, it's not a thing. We get that. We still want that. We want to know when we've arrived. It's not a duality. It is not something apart from something else.

Daido Roshi used to say, “All the way to heaven is heaven itself.” And then he would say, “I'm going to take you there, even if I have to carry you on my back.” He was kidding about that part. All the way is the way. And maybe that's why it takes three years, five years, ten years, twenty years to really know that. It's not an idea—we can have faith in it, it can encourage us, it can point us in the right direction, it can help us reorient when we get fixated on things. It can be useful in all kinds of ways, knowing that. But really knowing that, I think, must take time. It's just too baked in that it has to be otherwise.

When first ascending—the tears of waves, clouds and thunder accompany. The footnote says, regrets that heaven hasn't come yet. Thank goodness. Thank goodness. Why? So that we can learn how to walk, to swim, to leap, to fly.

Every living thing faces great odds in this life. You know, if you read about any life form, whether it's a tree or a flower or an insect or a mammal or a fish—in terms of propagation, in terms of a new generation and those new life forms actually succeeding into life—the odds are not in their favor. Very few make it. We've improved that a bit. But we still face dangers and risks—like the danger of caring, the risk of loving, the danger of committing yourself to something and saying, “Yes, I am going to do this, I am doing this.” And of course, the risk of what? Failure, thought, story.

Leaping up magnificently. Look at the great function so that we can discover our great function. The beautiful fish won't agree to be sunk in a pickle jar. In a sense, that's what we're expressing when we say, “I am not—I do not choose to live in samsara passively anymore,” right? I am committed to another way. I am not going to live in a pickle jar.

An old, mature person does not startle the crowd. This is in the training. A mature person, a person who's grown in time, has experienced a lifetime of practice. They've lost their shine. They're not startled. They've seen a few things, they've been through a few things. They've learned how to face adversity. They've learned to understand what is actual adversity—where is it? That's why Daido Roshi used to say, “This is not for sprinters; it's for long-distance runners.”

I remember there was a guy who called many years ago when I was at the office downstairs—I was registrar, I think he was from Oklahoma—and he said, “I've sold my farm, I'm packing everything up in a truck, and I'm coming out.” I said, “For what?” “To be there and do it until it's done.” I said, “Hang on, do not do that. Do not do that. Stop, wait. We need to have a conversation.” He said, “I'm coming.” And honest to God, he showed up on the doorstep days later. And do you know how long he stayed here? Not even a day, not even overnight, right? Because the moment he came in, I said, “Okay, so this is what it means.” He was like, “What?”

Floating. Floating. As light as five ounces. Easy, easy. Massive. Massive. Heavier than a thousand tons. Difficult. When light, mean it honestly. When heavy, mean it honestly—mean it simply, nakedly. Before the net, inside the net, beyond the net. What is the use of the net? What do you use for food? What do you use for food?

This afternoon, tomorrow we'll be doing Shuso Hossen, and, you know, we'll say something about that a little bit later. But, you know, it's important to understand because it's high ceremony, right? It's lots of drama. It's not that—it is not a performance. Please know that, that if the shuso has done his job, their job, when they say those words, they're real. They're real. Even though the words are offered and said by each chief disciple, they should be real. And this is how—one of the ways in which—this living, living dharma is passed down. It doesn't just happen within the student. It doesn't just happen between the student and teacher. It happens everywhere. And so tomorrow is a big everywhere that everybody is a part of and everybody makes happen. So please just appreciate that, that it's, you know, during Open Sozan and, you know, oftentimes, well-wishing people—I get it, people who love the chief disciple—say, “Have fun,” and I just cringe, right? I mean, I think I understand what they're saying, but it's like, it's not—make it a misery—but it is about life and death. It is about a house on fire. Is there joy in that? Absolutely. And there will be joy. But let it come from that natural, authentic place of doing something that is true and doing it in a way that is true.

So let's really, you know, think of all of this—three months of training, in a sense, your whole life of practice up to this point. And that we just stay here. That's what this week is about. You just stay here. It's not over. Tomorrow is an eon away. Let this moment be that eon.

37854,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-05-23 12:59","BA37","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Entering The Gate Of Wonder","","Good afternoon, everybody.

I was thinking earlier this week about what would be something I would enjoy talking about and would also feel suitable for the occasion, perhaps thematically appropriate, worthy of this august body. So knowing that words can never reach it, I thought it might be interesting to take up gates.

So we have the eight gates that we've been studying this ongo, and I was reflecting on that and thinking about gates. We talk about the sense gates, gates of entry, the gateless gate. And then I started thinking about Narnia and that experience that I had as a kid of being read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe aloud to me and being right there. When is it, Edmund, who opens the wardrobe? Lucy. Thank you. When Lucy opens the wardrobe and this other world is revealed.

And we were a little ways into sesshin, so I was kind of feeling like, yeah, totally. For those of us who were here on Wednesday, Roshi opened his talk by saying something like, okay, so we're in.

So first, just to give this a solid scriptural foundation, a short passage from the Lankavatara Sutra:

Thinking about beings in future ages, Mahamati asked the Buddha, ""Bhagavan, please tell us about the practices of realization whereby bodhisattvas become great practitioners.""

The Buddha answered, ""Mahamati, there are four practices, the mastery of which enables bodhisattvas to become great practitioners. And which four? Becoming adept at distinguishing the perceptions of one's own mind; perceiving the non-existence of external existence; avoiding views of arising, duration and cessation; and delighting in the personal realization of Buddha knowledge. These are the four practices, the mastery of which enables bodhisattvas to become great practitioners.""

So I would like to consider this first practice today: becoming adept at distinguishing the perceptions of one's own mind.

We say, ""Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha,"" the mantra, the great mantra, the vivid mantra at the end of the Heart Sutra, the unsurpassable mantra. And it translates roughly to: gone, gone, gone beyond, gone way beyond, to the other shore, svaha.

And one scholar I was looking at said, you know, the key word in this mantra is ""bodhi,"" which means awakening. And all the other words are modifying bodhi. ""Gate"" means gone, and ""paragate"" is apparently a stock Sanskrit expression that was used by the Jains and Buddhists to refer to arhats. So ""gate"" meaning gone, and ""paragate"" referring to arhats. And I guess the word ""para"" meaning the bank of a river on the opposite shore to the one which you're presently standing on. So it's got both meanings in one. The arhat, I guess, is named after that other shore, the one who's crossed to the other side of the river.

And ""parasamgate,"" ""sam"" is an intensive, which means completely or thoroughly or altogether. So, completely gone to the other shore. And then ""svaha"" is from Vedic Sanskrit and is said to be the name of the wife of Agni, the fire god. And it was used at the end of recitations that accompanied burnt offerings as part of a Vedic sacrifice ritual and meant sort of like ""amen."" So, not translated so much as a performative word.

And Allen Ginsberg translates the whole thing: ""Gone, gone, totally gone, totally gone. Over the top awakened mind. Svaha.""

So, ah, okay, so it's story time. So get your graham crackers and apple juice, all of you at home.

This is the story of Enid in Zendoland.

One unseasonably cloudy and cool spring day, Enid sat slumped on a park bench, holding her head in her hands and feeling especially discouraged about her life in particular, and about being a person in general. The problems were myriad. She was stressed out about work, had just had a falling out with her best friend, her new jeans did not fit her right, and her neighbor's apartment was infested with bedbugs. People hurried through the park on their way to who knows what, some pointless job or doomed online date. And other than the pigeons pecking at the scattered crumbs of her lunch, no one seemed to even notice her despair. Honestly, when you added the inevitable sickness, old age, and death to the picture, there just didn't seem to be much point to anything here in the human realm.

Enid sighed heavily.

Just then, a glossy black crow touched down, edging the pigeons out. It seemed to turn a shining black eye right toward her. ""Grr. You're late. You're late. It's time to go through the gate."" She could have sworn she heard it say.

Great. I'm losing my mind on top of everything, she thought, when she heard another sound.

""Psst. Psst.""

Enid looked around. There were just some random passersby, their attention glued to their phones.

""Psst. Over here.""

Enid turned and looked behind her. Peering out from behind a gnarled tree trunk a few yards away were a pair of dark, sparkling eyes belonging to a bald head. Enid squinted. An old woman dressed all in black, holding a tall staff and standing beside a rusty wrought iron gate. She looked distinctly out of place. Medieval, almost. A witch. Enid's heart started beating fast.

The old woman beckoned. ""Well, come on then. We're running a bit late and it's time for zazen. If we don't hurry, the zendo will close. Through the gate with you,"" the old woman said. She had a pleasant enough smile, though the top of one of her front teeth protruded noticeably.

""What? What are you... What are you talking about? Late for z... zenza? I don't even know. Are you a witch?"" Enid blurted out suspiciously, furrowing her eyebrow, which met like a snake across her forehead for a moment.

""What's a witch?"" the old woman said.

Enid hesitated, biting her lip. This could be tricky. Some possible responses flitted through her mind, but they all seemed a bit offensive. ""Someone who casts spells, I guess,"" Enid said finally.

""Oh no, then,"" said the old woman confidently. ""I'm someone who breaks them."" And with that, her eyes locked with Enid's for a moment, and Enid felt a rush of aliveness she hadn't felt in a very long time. Then, nodding briskly, the old woman gave Enid a firm little shove through the gate.

After a swirl of light and a tunnel of sound, Enid found herself outside an imposing stone structure at the foot of an ethereal green mountain. The old woman was there beside her, staff still in hand. A blue-gray cat with yellow eyes came running toward them, and Enid knelt down to pet her.

""That's Ling Zhao,"" the old woman said.

""Nice to meet you, Ling Zhao."" Enid stroked behind the cat's ears, velvet and soft.

Then another voice croaked, ""It's about time. We've been expecting you.""

Enid looked up to see an even older woman, also bald, also draped in dark flowing robes, poking her head out of a heavy wooden door. She had shaggy eyebrows, wore thick horn-rimmed glasses, and her ancient face was a maze of wrinkles and furrows.

""Where am I?"" Enid wondered.

As if she could read her mind, the old woman with the staff said, ""Enid. Welcome to Zendoland."" A shiver went through Enid's body.

""I'm Zhen Shen, and this is my dharma sister.""

""Dharma elder,"" Dharma Elder Zhenxian, said Zenzo.

The wrinkled woman in glasses nodded curtly. Enid stared.

""Wait. Who... Who are you?"" she asked.

""If you're not witches, then I suppose you could say we are...""

""Monks,"" Zhen Shen replied.

""Better: nuns,"" Zenzo croaked.

""Priests?"" Zhen Shen suggested.

""Buddha Ancestors,"" Zenzo said.

""True people of no rank,"" Zhen Shen finished.

Zenzo nodded. This seemed to settle the matter. Enid blinked a few times.

With that, Zenzo and Zhen Shen disappeared behind the wooden door, and with some trepidation and some excitement, Enid followed. After all, she thought, I have nothing to lose.

The first thing that she noticed was the smell. Oh, so familiar, but she couldn't quite place it. It was immediately calming, lightly smoky, a little spicy and sweet, like the smell of a damp autumn forest mixed with her grandmother's closet.

The next thing she noticed was that it was dark and very quiet, and although Enid could hardly see, she could feel that there were more than three of them in the space. As her eyes adjusted, she saw she was at the threshold of a great hall filled with people. At least they seemed to be people, but they weren't like any people she had seen before. They were sitting perfectly still. No one was moving, not at all. Certainly no one was talking. No one was looking around or checking their phone. Everyone was just sitting there, upright, awake, still, and silent.

Enid had never seen anything like it.

""What are they doing?"" she whispered.

Zhen Shen considered this for a moment. Then she grinned, her top tooth snagging her lip slightly. ""Nothing.""

Zenzo grunted in assent. ""That is, if they can help it."" She chuckled knowingly.

Enid's brow furrowed. ""Nothing?"" Enid asked, growing curiouser and curiouser. It sure seemed different from when Enid did nothing. All those nights crashed out on the couch, staring into space, rising periodically to fetch a snack from the kitchen, maybe a Twinkie or one of those good creamy yogurts. This was different. So intent. She'd never seen a single person so completely do nothing, let alone a whole room full of people just sitting there doing nothing. The notion was startling. All that busyness, all that running around with work and promotions and shopping and dating. And here, everyone just sitting so still.

She felt her eyes start to well up. A tremble went through her. She looked over at Zhen Shen, who was watching her closely.

""What do you mean by doing nothing?"" Enid asked.

""Think. Non-thinking,"" Zenzo grunted. ""Purify, cure, grind down, or brush away all the tendencies you have fabricated into apparent habits.""

""Uh, okay,"" Enid said.

""Traps and snares can never reach it,"" Zenzo croaked.

Enid furrowed her brows, the black snake appearing for another instant.

""They're practicing,"" Zhen Shen interjected. ""They're practicing being aware of the breath, each breath as present as they can be. And they are watching their minds.""

""Watching what?"" Enid had spent countless hours watching all sorts of things. She had a big-screen TV and subscriptions to Netflix and Hulu and Disney. There was no shortage of things to watch. But she had never, ever, ever considered watching her own mind.

""Why would they do that or not do that?"" Enid asked.

Zhen Shen turned to Zenzo, who was stroking her chin, which Enid noted was dotted with several wiry white whiskers.

""Suffering,"" Zenzo snorted.

""Suffering?"" Enid asked.

""End of suffering,"" Zenzo clarified.

Enid looked back at the people in the hall, sitting so still. They were watching their minds to end suffering. It felt like the strangest thing she had ever encountered. And at the very same time it made a certain kind of sense. A certain deep kind of sense. She was more than intrigued.

""How does it work?"" Enid asked.

Zenzo peered over her thick glasses. Her eyes were milky with cataracts, but Enid got the feeling that she could see her perfectly clearly in some other way.

""Mind. Mind creates the suffering. So much struggle. Big tortures and small terrors. All of it. Mind, thoughts, emotions. And where are these thoughts? What are they?"" Zenzo paused, as though waiting for an answer, but Enid had nothing to say. What were thoughts? She wondered. She had never—well, she had never thought about it. What were they? Where were they? In her head, she guessed, but somehow that seemed too obvious.

Zhen Shen picked up the thread, adding, ""We're like fish who never ask what is water. We swim in an ocean of thought and emotion. So much struggle, so much suffering. But we may not have asked. We may not have noticed this ocean of thought. We just have our struggles. We believe that's how it is. That's the spell. To break it, we watch the mind. We settle the mind. We get to know the mind, to know its tricks, to know its power.""

""So like making thoughts go away?"" Enid said.

Zenzo and Zhen Shen exchanged glances. This was always the tricky part.

""Sweep as you may, you'll never empty the mind,"" Zenzo muttered now, her gnarled hand smoothing the white stubble of her head.

""But, but, but... You said thoughts are making the suffering.""

Zenzo shook her head, ""Becoming adept at distinguishing the perceptions of one's own mind,"" said Zhen Shen. ""It's different from getting rid of thoughts. Distinguishing them, getting to know them, recognizing them. Seeing what is a thought. And where does it come from?""

""Nothing there, actually,"" Zenzo chimed in. ""No problem at all actually. Sitting still, watching it all, little by little, we can see. Takes time. Lots of time. Habits are deep. Karma is strong. But it can be done.""

Zhen Shen nodded. ""So much stronger than we think. But if we can deeply see again and again and recognize that thoughts aren't real in any lasting way, then it's like waking up from a dream or...""

Enid interrupted, ""Like breaking a spell.""

Zhen Shen nodded. ""Yes,"" she said. ""Like breaking a spell.""

""I want to do it!"" Enid shouted. ""I want to break the spell.""

Zenzo's eyes seemed to flash behind her glasses, as though sizing Enid up with some other sense beyond vision.

""Difficult, difficult, difficult. To go beyond concepts is like covering a tree with sesame seeds.""

""I can do difficult things,"" Enid countered.

Suddenly, Zenzo seemed to tower over her. ""Who are you?"" she barked.

""I'm Enid,"" Enid said.

""Thought,"" Zenzo barked.

Enid glanced around. ""Okay. I'm a project manager.""

""More thoughts. Concepts,"" Zenzo responded.

Enid tried again. ""Well, I'm a mildly depressed woman who—""

""Stories. Thoughts. Concepts. Stories,"" Zenzo interrupted.

""I... I'm... You're making me anxious,"" Enid blurted.

""Thought,"" Zenzo growled.

""I don't get it. What am I supposed... supposed to say?""

""Thought. Stop. Stop. You're freaking me out.""

""Thought, Thought, Thought. Who are you?"" Zenzo snarled.

Enid cried out, taking her head in her hands.

Suddenly it was very quiet. Suddenly the room felt very big. Enid could feel the space around her, soft and velvety. So much space all the way through. She raised her eyes. As if for the first time, she noticed the sunlight coming in through the windows. As if for the first time, she heard the sound of the robins outside. They seemed to go right through her.

""What just happened?""

""Upaya,"" Zhen Shen offered, smiling and exposing her snaggletooth. ""Skillful means.""

Enid took a breath.

""We have to see that thoughts and concepts are empty. We have to see that thoughts and concepts are empty. Perceptions are empty. Perceptions seem different from thoughts, more objective. But if you look closely, they're mixed in and tangled up with thoughts. We believe we are our thoughts. We believe we are our concepts. But it is like being under a spell,"" Zhen Shen explained. ""And it's extremely subtle.""

""For a moment,"" Enid said, ""for a moment, it was like I was as light as a feather.""

Zhen Shen smiled. ""Yes, for a moment. You see,"" she said, ""when we train the mind, we learn to see our thoughts as thoughts. Seeing them this way, we don't have to get rid of them. We just need to recognize them. Things do exist, after all. You are here. You do exist. The question is just how so. We watch our minds to see how things exist. And in this way we end suffering. We wake up from the dream. We break the spell.""

Enid nodded. It was a lot to take in, but still she felt she had touched something true.

The blue-gray cat with the yellow eyes emerged from around a corner, waving her tail in the air.

""It's a beautiful cat,"" Enid said. ""It reminds me of my kitty at home.""

""Thought,"" Zenzo whispered. This time gently.

Enid dropped the idea of her kitty from home. She looked at the blue-gray cat. Suddenly its sleek blue-gray fur was right there, vivid, pulsing alive.

""Hmm. So am I not supposed to think?""

""Of course you can think,"" said Zenzo.

""Thinking is amazing,"" Zhen Shen proffered. ""It's our most potent power. It's just that we don't know how to use it. We don't even know that we are using it, and so we're used by it. It's like the most powerful empress in the universe had taken you captive instead of you wielding that power yourself for good. So you see, in the zendo, we take our seats and we train not to get rid of thought, not to stop thinking, but to settle the mind. Yes, thinking can slow down quite a bit sometimes, and that's helpful. So that we can recognize the thoughts. So that we can have a break from all that thinking. So that we can pierce the veil, go beyond, enter the gateless gate. All the while we're becoming familiar with how our thoughts create the world. And then maybe you can see where this is going. Then we can use them for good.""

""It takes time,"" Zenzo chimed in. ""One thought follows the next, and before you know it, away you go, back to suffering. Difficult, difficult, difficult,"" Zenzo murmured.

Zhen Shen made a soft hum. ""Easy, easy, easy. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to create. Don't try to get rid of it. Don't try to make it stay. Just let it roll.""

Enid wasn't sure.

At that moment, the blue-gray cat leapt up onto the windowsill, knocking over the vase of grasses.

""Ling Zhao always gets the last word.""

""Well, all this is really just the tip of the iceberg,"" Zhen Shen said after a pause.

""What do you mean?"" Enid said.

""This dharma is infinitely subtle and incomparably profound,"" Zhen Shen said knowingly. ""It's boundless and impossible to attain. But for those who want to know, training gives a way to travel ever deeper into the mystery of who we really are.""

""Okay,"" said Enid. ""I want to do it. I want to train.""

""Then you'll be here for breakfast tomorrow? We're having cake,"" snorted Zenzo.

""Cake?"" Enid brightened.

""It's not really cake,"" Zhen Shen corrected. ""It's sweet bread.""

Behind her glasses, Zenzo rolled her eyes and snorted. ""Oh, it's cake all right. Cake for breakfast every morning. Good Zendoland fare.""

Enid smiled. ""Well, whether we call it cake or sweet bread doesn't really matter, right? I mean, no one's eating concepts for breakfast. And anyway, it sounds delicious.""

Zenzo and Zhen Shen exchanged a pleased glance.

""You caught a live one, dear sister,"" mumbled Zenzo.

""Nothing better,"" said Zhen Shen.

Cake for breakfast then, Enid thought as she crossed the threshold to the zendo, tiptoed to take her place among the rows.

If we get caught in thought, if it feels like one of those sort of, I don't know, bound up moments where it feels like—I know I'm thinking, I know I'm thinking, I know I'm thinking, but like, how do I get out of this?

I remember once, many years ago in dokusan at the temple, Shugen Roshi said something to me like, ""Well, it's all just working with energy."" And I was kind of like, wait, what? And he sort of backed that up and obviously that stayed with me.

When we can feel that like, I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught in thought, there's an energetic tension that's in our body-mind. You don't have to get rid of anything and aggression will only be a temporary measure if it even works at all.

So it's like what Gokan was saying yesterday about relaxation. It's like, can we find, you know, there's the tension that we can feel in our body. If you can find that, excellent, that's a great place to enter in, to try and just bring your awareness to it and let that begin to soften. And then thought is creating an energetic tension in our body-mind. And that's subtle, that's subtle. But finding that, finding that and then again, same, just like with the muscle tension, letting your awareness rest with that and just being still with that. Don't try to make it stay, don't try to make it go, just let it roll.

The more we can refine that, the more the self-liberative aspect of thought can become part of our own upaya. So first we have to recognize thought for thought.

May our practice and effort here be for the benefit of all beings.

I have just a few things to say this afternoon. This is a short talk. I hope that for each one of you there's something helpful.

A couple of weeks ago, during the Ongo intensive, Shugen Roshi gave us some writing prompts, some art practice prompts, and one of them was to have some words with Yama. Yama is the Lord of Death, who I think only comes when it's time. Part of what I said to him is, ""Wait, not yet. I like being alive."" I said, ""I will not worry anymore. I will not complain or criticize. I will not be dissatisfied. I will only trust and love, only appreciate.""

I found it a helpful exercise, helpful to reflect: How are we using our mind, our life, our lives, our energies? It can be an ongoing reflection, a practice of reflecting and remembering. Death will come for me as it comes for everyone. The when, the where, the how—I do not know. But death will come. I'm going to die. Those I love are going to die. I'll be separated from all that I care about. So in this time that I have, I vow. I vow.

I find that there is ongoing reflection—can be ongoing reflection—maybe of the precepts, other vows that we've taken, these remembrances. And then sometimes we actually hear it. Sometimes we're ready to change, to make a vow and act on that vow. There have been times when I have experienced that, and a vow has changed my life. And sometimes this reflection may be kind of about the big picture. How would you like to use your life? What would you like to do? And there's also the kind of more hard-to-see interior: How do I want to use my mind? In a way, that's where our life is happening.

So I said these things to Yama: worry, complaint, criticizing, being dissatisfied—because I know them, familiar energies that arise in my body-mind. I work with them. I have worked with them. I was remembering when I was first in residence, realizing that every time I sat down, I would sort of groan, and that I was kind of going through my day doing things like that, and realizing I was creating something—that I was basically complaining throughout the day. And so I changed that. I was 24 at the time. Now, sometimes I sit down and I do kind of groan a little bit. But these energies that arise in my body-mind—my relationship with them has changed over time. They arise differently.

In studying them, I know that they keep me separate, that they are obscurations, as we say, that they are habitual, that I'm creating something. They're negative; they are suffering. And so doing this exercise a couple weeks ago, having these words with Yama, felt like maybe I'm ready to let something go here.

I've been reading the Surangama Sutra, which is a Mahayana sutra, which I kind of just found. I think maybe there haven't been translations so available. And I'm also reading some commentary that goes along with it. And there's much more language about purifying the mind than I'm kind of used to—purifying the mind of obscurations, kleshas, desires and aversions, reactivity, conflict, suffering; purifying the mind of what obscures the mind. Ultimately, there's nothing to purify, but there are all these things that prevent us from knowing that, from knowing our true mind.

Also, in the Surangama Sutra, to the extent that I understand it—I'm finding it difficult—there's a lot of the Buddha telling Ananda that things are illusion. The Buddha asks Ananda questions. Ananda is an excellent student, an example of a student in the sutra. And Ananda responds to the Buddha as best he can with some seemingly very good answers, seemingly based in the teachings, in the Buddha's own teachings. And then, over and over again, the Buddha points out, shows how, ""No, Ananda, basically, everything you're saying is based on an assumption. Everything is an illusion."" He goes through mind, all of our perceptions, organs of perception—over and over, saying, ""No, that is an illusion.""

I was feeling earlier, it's kind of a mystery. It's kind of mysterious how this self arises, that comes into being, kind of coalesces around something. This mystery of all these things that arise in our experience that we react to, we get upset with, we want to possess. When we look closely—what is there? We can't find anything. There is nothing to find, no thing to find. And yet we respond, we react, we get upset. What's happening? And, you know, a lot of the time it doesn't seem like a mystery. We're just upset. There is just this barrier that we're struggling with. But with some space, some familiarity, some looking: what's happening? What's happening?

Looking a little bit at complaining, being dissatisfied, and wondering, why do I like this? Why do I do this? I do like it in a way, a little kind of twisted-up pain, pleasure—certainly familiar. Maybe this is part of why samsara is so hard to kind of see our way out of. There's a lot of time that we may not see that we're suffering because it seems like we're getting—seems like we're getting what we want, or we're just caught up in trying to get what we want. But even when we have a sense that we're suffering, even when we know that we're suffering, it's hard to get out, it's hard to kind of change, because we like it somehow.

And I was thinking—I'm not sure how to say this—because in a way it is just that: things. It's difficult to see that things are an illusion, to see that they are created and conditioned, our experience. And kind of the other side of that is that when our mind does clear and open, when we have some experience of letting go, of seeing more clearly—you know, often it comes like towards the end of sesshin or somewhere in sesshin—and it's like we had to do a lot of work to get there, to see that, to let go, just to let go, let things open. But kind of to not be fooled by that—it's not that we are creating something with all of that work, all of this work that we're doing. We're just practicing letting go. Seeing and letting go, releasing, allowing our habitual, our familiar, our sometimes hard-to-see mind states—just letting them settle, loosen, allowing our natural mind to be less obscured, unobscured. Can we trust that? I think we know that we're returning to ourselves, not making something. But it's important to see that.

I was talking recently with a student who really struggles with difficult mind states, confusing mind states, and they were telling me that they had been here for a while, and when they went home for like an hour, it all cleared. It all cleared. And I asked them, ""Well, what did you learn from that?"" And they said they could see—they said that all of those things that are usually so confusing, I create them. So important to see that.

Yesterday, when Shugen talked about how over time, in just seeing things arise and pass away and getting to know ourselves and learning to work with ourselves and letting go, that then there's not so much surprise—which I understood to mean not seeing new things in ourselves, new barriers, struggles—and I was just kind of thinking, like, is that true for me? And the thing that, you know, where the surprise is, is how the same things still come up. Just last night, this morning, I was, like, starting to get caught up. And it's not a surprise in the sense that, no, I know this. I see what's happening. I know how to work with this, how to make space, loosen, how to find my seat again, return to myself. But I still get surprised that it happens.

In our men's group last week, I think it was, we were talking about insecurity and comparing and sort of feelings around that. And I was saying, you know, this is what I have worked with for my whole life. And that there have been times in my practice over the years where I felt like, yeah, now I think I'm done with that. I think I really, like, let it go. I finally kind of pulled it out by the roots because it had changed so much. I can't remember now, sort of in my body-mind, how it was. But it keeps surprising me. It kind of slips in under the door. And so I don't say that anymore. That's what I was saying.

This is not a perfect analogy, but I was thinking that it was kind of like—those of you who knew Uconn—he used to like to hide behind doors and jump out and scare. I assume he did this to other people, but he certainly did it to me. And, you know, a lot of the time, I would jump, right? But then it would just be Uconn there, laughing and so pleased that he had scared me.

A while back, Shugen Roshi, in a talk, said something about that we can think of zazen as relaxing completely. I've been kind of carrying that around with me, wondering, kind of checking it out. I don't think I've ever heard him say that before: ""Zazen is relaxing completely."" And so I've been kind of like, is that always true? Is this what it means to practice in accord—in accord with the Dharma? To practice no conflict, no opposition. Relaxing completely. To practice not creating—relaxing completely. What is this relaxing?

I've been trying this as I go through my day. Walking to the office building: relaxing. When I'm chanting: relaxing. Working on this talk: relaxing. And in that feeling, finding what is not relaxed. Where is that tension? What is that? Finding what I think wants to be relaxed. It wants me to relax. It helps it to relax, allow it to relax. But this not-yet-relaxed comes in different forms.

Sometimes it's kind of apparent, obvious, like it's tightness or irritation. Or sometimes, walking to the office, I'll realize, why am I in a hurry? Why am I moving so quickly? There's some tension there. Relaxing, coming back into my body. And sometimes it's very different. Pretty much every time when I'm working on a talk, I get to a point where it feels like I've said this before. I always say the same thing. I can't say this to the sangha. But really, it's this heaviness in my body, and I know this very well. Didn't actually get that much this week. But how do I relax that? Where's the grasping in that? There must be grasping. Somewhere in that mind state, I can feel the suffering. Where is the grasping, the creating? How am I creating conflict?

Zazen is relaxing completely. Is that true for all forms of zazen? If you're working with the breath, what is it to do your practice, to do your practice wholeheartedly and relax completely? If you're working with a koan, what would it be to do that practice wholeheartedly, relax completely? If you're doing shikantaza, are you relaxing completely? Is that the not-doing of shikantaza? This, not-this.

Relaxing completely reminded me of this passage from Daoxin—it's the fourth Zen ancestor—which I read a little while ago. He's asked a question. The question is, ""How can we illuminate and purify our minds?"" So he's being asked, what do I do in my meditation?

Daoxin says: ""It is not by reciting the Buddha name, not by restricting mind, not by observing mind, not by calculating thought, not by contemplation, not by the practice of observation, not by scattering and confusion. Just let it roll along, don't make it go, and don't let it stay. In solitude and peace, mind of itself is illuminated and pure. If we can observe it truly, mind is instantly illuminated and pure. Mind is like a clear mirror. If we can observe it truly for a year, it will be even more clear and pure. If for three years or five years, even more clear and pure.""

Just let it roll along, don't make it go, don't make it stay. Is this relaxing completely? What is he saying? I think we can hear, know, trust that when we have an idea of what our mind should be like in meditation, and we're trying to make our mind match that idea, it doesn't work. That's not the way to illuminate and purify the mind. When we're trying to control the mind, control our thoughts, it doesn't work. That's not the way to illuminate and purify the mind.

In my experience, it is certainly around concentration, ideas of what concentration should be like, that I get stuck, tight. This is where we can block things out, bypass, trying not to be disturbed by our thoughts and feelings, fighting with our thoughts and emotions and feelings, trying to make things quiet. We do need to learn to be concentrated, to concentrate, whatever our practice is. But it's not from controlling. What is it you're trying to control?

Because our habits are body and mind. We experience them body and mind, feel them in the body. The familiarity is in the body and the mind. Familiarity with our kleshas, our difficult mental states or complaining—it's in the body-mind. That familiarity in the body, I think, is part of what makes it hard to see that it is just to see it for what it is.

And so something I've experimented with, that I work with, is bringing something different into my body-mind. In a way, I think this is true of all of the practices that we do. Our practices are just of coming close, of being intimate so that we experience that in our body-mind. What is that? How is that? Allow that to be familiar. Distraction may be familiar. We have to—how do we let that go? And let that be not what we default to.

This is also how I experience metta practices. To be able to offer someone peace, I have to feel peace in my own body-mind, know peace in my own body-mind. And I've found that kind of magical—to bring into my body love, acceptance, peace, loving attention; allow that to permeate, become familiar for me. And so that then I can offer that, change my relationship by offering that.

And I think this is true also in learning to relax. Relax body-mind, to get familiar with relaxed body-mind—relaxed and open and awake. Allowing space for ourselves to be ourselves completely. Not trying to make anything, not trying to control.

Daoxin says: ""Mind of itself is illuminated and pure. If we can observe it truly, mind is instantly illuminated and pure. If we can observe it truly for a year, it will be even more clear and pure. If for three years or five years, even more clear and pure."" Letting it sink in—for a year, for three years, for five years—becoming convinced. Mind of itself is illuminated and pure. We do not make it more pure.

I wanted to end with a story about Dongshan, one of our important ancestors. The story is that the gods wanted to see Dongshan, but they couldn't because he was so empty of ego attachment that he was invisible to the gods. They would go looking for him and they would pass through him or enter into him. But they couldn't see him. And they were very curious about this person who had become so empty. So they played a little trick on him. One day, when Dongshan went out for a walk, they went into the kitchen, the monastery kitchen, and took some handfuls of food. And they took them out and they threw them on the path.

When Dongshan came back, he saw this food just strewn across the path. You shouldn't treat food like that. It's disrespectful. It is alive. It is not good practice in a Zen monastery. When Dongshan saw this food strewn across the path, he got upset. He was a little offended. He couldn't believe that some of his disciples, one of his disciples, would have been so careless. And for a moment, the gods could see him. He wasn't empty anymore. Something had crystallized around his reaction. A cloud appeared in the emptiness of his being, and the gods could see him. And then it dissipated, and they couldn't see him anymore. His reaction disappeared. He knew how to return from his reaction.

I like that story. A Zen story. Just a person who's purified his mind and still has reactions.

So, we're right in the middle of sesshin. Allow yourself to be fully in sesshin. Can't see the beginning, can't see the end. We should know how fortunate we are and use this time well.

This is from the record of Layman Pang. One day the layman was sitting in his thatched cottage.

“Difficult, difficult, difficult,” he suddenly said, “like trying to scatter ten measures of sesame seed all over a tree.”
“Easy, easy, easy,” returned Mrs. Pang, “just like touching your feet to the ground when you get out of bed.”
“Neither difficult nor easy,” said Ling Zhao. “On the hundred grass tips, the ancestors.”

So, we’re in it now. There is something that comes closer, becomes more possible with sustained practice. That’s why intensives such as this are important in most of the practice-based schools of Buddhism. When we have the opportunity to immerse ourselves, and with just slight voyages off the cushion, but to stay close.

Difficult, difficult, difficult, the layman said. There’s something to be said for being told this in advance. And the teachings do not apologize, do not conceal the fact that it is a long path and there will be many challenges along the way. And I think there’s something very refreshing in that true speech. 

At the same time, sometimes being told something will be difficult can set up something in the mind, something that is expectant. When I was in college, I was in the school orchestra. Our regular conductor was not a great conductor; he was very wishy-washy about everything. When we were getting ready for a performance, he would get up there and say, “Well, you know, this is kind of a hard piece, you know, but let’s just give it our shot, you know.” And that’s what he got.

And then once a year we had a guest conductor who was another teacher at the school, was excellent, but he was a choral conductor. So just once a year he would conduct the orchestra and he would get up and just say, “Okay, we’re doing this.” And that’s what he got—a different orchestra, a different group of musicians, same people ascending the mountain, training.

So yeah, it becomes pretty clear pretty early that it’s not going to be a cakewalk, that whatever great plans we have made are just going to have to be put away, and that’s okay. You know, the challenge really is when our expectations meet reality. Can we yield? Can we yield to reality and turn towards that and give up all of our easy dreams?

So we meet our habits, our tendencies, our memories, our reactivity, our regrets, our insecurities. We see our attachments are strong—stronger than we thought. And we keep seeing that. They seem to keep being stronger than we thought. Faith seems to come and go. Our energy rises and falls. And there’s a kind of maturing, a kind of seasoning that happens when you sit in one place and watch yourself go through all of those changes.

Because we’re just so used to just change, change, change the condition, change the environment, change what I’m looking at, change what I’m doing. And when you’re just sitting here on this cushion in your world, just keep showing up and showing you, showing each of us. And you don’t go away. You don’t fly away.

It’s hard to recognize in the beginning. Maybe a good analogy is like when we’re young, you know, kids growing up, going through stuff, you know, and we just see it as this—just what’s happening right now. This heartbreak, this triumph, this contest, this whatever. We don’t see it within this large view that each of those experiences is teaching us something, presenting us with something. We’re learning about life. We’re learning how to be a person, how to live. But we don’t have that big picture, right? 

We realize how labile everything is. In a sense, the things we’ve been relying on for so long are just really not reliable. Not for what we actually want, not what we’re seeking.

So, you know, there’s the Vimalakirti Sutra, which is this sort of large and perfect embodiment of a fully realized being—free in every situation, having realized every dharma—and a layperson. But it’s fictional, right? Vimalakirti was not ever a historical person. But Layman Pang was. He studied with different teachers, 8th century Shitou, Mazu. There’s somewhat known about him. He had a family. He also had a son who I think was an artist—doesn’t usually get included because he was off doing his own thing. You gotta have one of those, right?

But the family, and particularly Layman Pang and Ling Zhao, they seemed to be particularly close. But they were all practitioners. And according to the records, they were all realized. So that’s a nice family to be born into.

And it’s said that he—I’ve never seen what he did in his life to make his livelihood—but at a certain point, when he got really involved in the Dharma, he thought, “This is just a hotbed of attachments.” So he put all of his stuff in a boat and took it out in the lake and sunk it because he didn’t want anybody else to have it either. No comment on how the family felt about that, but it’s a done deal. And then he spent a lot of time wandering. Towards the end of his life, he lived in a cave for a while. And there are different records of his teachings. And this is one of them.

Difficult, difficult, difficult. Like trying to spread bushels of sesame seed all over a tree. So he’s making it clear—it’s difficult, what we’re trying to do. The habits of a lifetime, lifetimes, deeply embedded and in a sense, to a certain extent, instinctual, right? When something’s painful, get away. When something’s pleasurable, go towards it. Hold on to what you don’t want to lose. When somebody makes you angry, get angry back. If there’s a problem out there that’s causing you distress, see if you can change it, conquer it, get away from it. When you’re experiencing difficulty, do something to change that. When you don’t feel good, when you don’t like what you’re feeling, add meaning to it. It means something. What does it mean?

And so whether it’s a person or a family or a community or a nation or a world, samsara finds its way into wherever we are. So an old teacher said, is there anyone who can find a true path home? A true path? In Buddhism, a path means something very particular. It’s not just, well, everybody’s on a path. Some of them work, some of them don’t. No, that’s not how it’s seen in Buddhism. It’s very intentional. It’s based in what is true. And it’s a path. It’s not just a random road going somewhere. It’s a path that is Eightfold and noble, right? You are given provisions. We are given provisions, guides. And then, as the Buddha said, he could only point. And then we have to find our way. We have to find our way.

Like when Huike came to Bodhidharma, “My mind is not at peace. Please set it at peace.” He wanted nothing more in the world than that. And Bodhidharma said, “Bring it to me, this mind that is in turmoil, that is tormenting you, that brought you to this very place, bring that very mind to me.” That should not be hard. And then he left it to Huike to find that mind.

But of course, the difficulties don’t begin when we enter practice. If they did, we probably wouldn’t be here. But they often seem to increase. They seem to get worse somehow, or more, or bigger. And actually, that’s a good sign. It’s a sign that we’re looking, we’re paying attention, we’re not turning away—not too much.

We can think that because we, you know, in the dual world, we think everything works like a machine, and so walking a path means every foot takes you one step further, one step closer to your goal. And you can track your distance, right? Get an odometer, get a map. You can track exactly where you are and you know how far you are from the beginning and how far you are from the end. And there is a beginning and there is an end. Not this one.

And so we can think in that way of thinking that every step is not only going to get us closer, but it’s going to get easier, right? Because it’s a path of liberation. We should be liberating ourselves, right? Would anyone disagree? 

And so, but then when we go through these, we see these moments of burst, right? Everything’s fine. Then everything’s fine. And then we think, okay, you know, in the beginning, I can handle that. But then at a certain point, we think, okay, I’ve done that. No more of that. Now I’m just smooth sailing. And hearing that, we can think, okay, so it’s not really working, right? The same stuff keeps happening.

No, not really. It’s not the same, because the stuff of it is not in the...it’s in my mind. What do I see? How do I respond? How do I understand this? That’s not the same. And so those outbursts keep happening, but they’re not the same. And yet, they still require attention. Sometimes they throw us back a bit. 

And so we establish intention, raise our aspiration, keep going, don’t be afraid. It’s easy to get lost. That doesn’t take a lot of skill, right? In fact, you probably have. You probably will. Everybody gets lost for a moment, for a day, for months, sometimes for years, sometimes forever. There are those who are lost and do not find their way back—not in this lifetime. They’re not looking.

And so how to walk a path takes skill. That’s what we’re developing: skill. It’s not just learning how to meditate and making sure you get to the cushion sufficiently, or chanting the sutra, or reading some texts. It’s a whole thing going on. And we have to learn how to do that, just like the child has to learn how to be a human being, how to be in the world.

I was listening recently to an educator. An interviewer was talking to them about—in this section about AI—and she said, you know, children need to learn how to do. They need to do things that are difficult. They have to learn things that are hard to learn. And they have to go through that struggle of trying to learn something that’s not easy, right? It may not even seem relevant or important. I mean, I’m sure we’ve all had experiences when we were in school, like, what’s the point? This doesn’t interest me. This is no good for me. I don’t care about this. I’m never going to use this. 

And that may be true about the subject, but that’s also looking in a very, very narrow way. But that when we have to learn or stay with something, engage something and really try, that’s difficult. We’re learning a whole lot more than just whatever the subject is.

And she was talking about when AI came into the schools, that the teachers were like, “Okay, we have to have anti-plagiarism tools.” And the kids immediately learned how to hack that, get around it. And so she was saying, we’re never gonna beat the kids on this in terms of creating something that they can’t get around.

And I was thinking, right, so maybe that’s not the point. The point is, how do you teach a child to not want to get around it? How do we teach, how do we learn to want to learn, even if the subject isn’t easy? And the person that she was interviewing was saying, “You know, I was that kid. I thought school was boring. I didn’t like it. I struggled with it.” But then they had some encounters that inspired them, and they really got very interested in one thing. And he really studied this one thing, and his whole relationship with learning began to change. And then he said, and then he went back to some of those other subjects that he’d hated and thought were stupid and irrelevant. And he realized he could study those now. He had learned something that transcended just the subject itself.

Practice is a lot like that. And so we need to free ourselves from the idea that because something is difficult or painful, it’s bad, and if it’s easy or pleasurable, it’s good.

I’ve been rereading Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. And he was talking about how in all these experiments that they’ve done about just how people make decisions and sort of the relationship between the emotional aspect, you know, or the feeling that guides us versus the intellect, which rationalizes, and that people basically believe that if I’m feeling good about something, that must mean I like it, and if I don’t feel good about something, that must mean I don’t like it. So clearly, as practitioners, we have to get beyond that or else we’ll never practice.

They did an experiment where somebody was on the street asking passersby a series of questions that had a moral component to it and asking them for their opinion to sort of make a moral judgment. And they were standing next to a trash can, and with some of the people, the trash can was just empty. They’d ask the question, people would respond, make a moral judgment, and then pass it on. And other people, before the person came up, the interviewer would spray what they called fart spray into the trash can, right? So the person comes up and the air is, like, filled with this fart spray. And they found that people still made moral judgments, but they were much harsher, right? And so how a person is feeling affects their judgment, their sort of reaction, their mood, their temperament, their attitude.

In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, Subhuti and Shariputra are having a little chat one day about the Dharma. Shariputra says, “Venerable Subhuti, the Supreme Enlightenment is hard to come by. Hard, difficult, difficult, difficult. Why? In the same way that it has not occurred to space, ‘I shall know enlightenment.’ Space doesn’t think, ‘I shall know enlightenment.’ Just so, it doesn’t occur to the bodhisattva, ‘I shall know enlightenment.’ Why? Because the same as space are all dharmas. And it is after they have firmly believed in all dharmas as the same as space, that the bodhisattva knows full enlightenment.”

So when the bodhisattva understands, has faith in that all things are empty, nothing is fixed. They can’t get it. It’s not a thing, right? They can’t just set a goal and move towards that. It’s not a treasure hunt, right? There’s a treasure there, and it’s hidden somewhere. But if you get to it, you’ll find that treasure and you’ll have it, like that mani jewel in the claw of the dragon.

He said, once the bodhisattva understands that, then they realize how difficult this is going to be—because it’s not a thing. “If on the part of the bodhisattva, who has firmly believed that all dharmas are the same as space, the Supreme Enlightenment were easy to win, not hard to come by, then bodhisattvas, countless as the sands of the Ganges, would not turn away from enlightenment and would easily attain it.” 

So in this way, it’s difficult, difficult, difficult because its very nature. If it were just, you know, an answer—a question is asked, you have to figure out the question, the answer, like an exam, a test. It’s the ultimate test, right? But you just have to figure out the answer, use your mind. Then we would do that. But it’s not that. Because all dharmas are the same as space.

Of course, we don’t experience them that way. We experience them as having weight, as having solidity. This emotion, this memory, this sensation, this action, this person, this mood—it feels so real. Not just in the sense that I’m experiencing something, but in a sense that it is something that is happening to me. And that’s why the bodhisattva does not think, “I will know enlightenment.” That’s—we have to give that up. It is something that I will know, I will attain. It is not like that. Taizan Roshi used to often say, “It is not like something.”

But then Mrs. Pang says, “Easy, easy, easy. Like touching your feet on the ground when you get out of bed.” The Supreme Way is not difficult if only you do not pick and choose. Just like your feet touching the ground when you get out of bed. You don’t have to think about it, plan, prepare. You’re already home and there’s no step that’s going to bring you closer. Easy, easy, easy.

The obstacles are not as they appear. When something arises, it’s something. It has qualities and characteristics. That’s how we can recognize it. It’s got meaning. It’s got a story. We have a story about it. We have a relationship with it. This isn’t the first time. Even if we haven’t seen this one, we’ve seen a lot of other ones that are like this one. So we throw them all into the same box. We know it. And in that moment of knowing, it feels good. Or in that moment of knowing, this doesn’t feel good at all. I like this. I don’t like this. This is good. This is not good.

And so there seems to be a whole lot going on in that object. That’s where the qualities and characteristics are. I was fine until it arose, and now look what’s happening. So the evidence seems to be that that object has got something going on that’s doing something to me. I want more of it. I don’t want any of it. So, deal with the object. Get it, possess it, get rid of it.

And so the radical faith of practice is realize there’s something there—not what we think, but what we really need to do is turn around, turn it around. It’s not about the object. It’s this mind, it’s this moment, it’s this response, it’s this clinging, it’s this rejecting. It’s this body, it’s this emotion. In that way, the object is just, in a way, a friend, right? Helping to show the self arise so that we can see, stop and see. Easy, easy, easy.

In the same way that if we want to be a compassionate person and live a compassionate life, the way that happens is by being compassionate and living compassionately. You know, it’s not like we can do some sort of, you know, stuff over here, and then one day we’re just going to be compassionate, right? We actually have to be bringing forth being, that very thing, practicing that. And so that’s what we do. That’s why we need to be practicing compassion.

In our zazen, there’s virtually almost no element of the Dharma in which morality, good and bad, in our way of seeing it, isn’t present, isn’t needing our attention. And in the same way, if we want to live a life that is, you know, awake and aware and mindful, then we have to be mindful. If we want to live an enlightened life, then we have to be an enlightened being.

Well, now, hang on. That seems a lot harder. How can we be an enlightened being on the path of enlightenment when we’re not enlightened? By bringing forth the mind, the qualities, the aspiration, the virtues of an enlightened being—the precepts, the paramitas, the practice. And so when we meet the moment in love and hate and grasping and rejecting and our opinions and, you know, our habits—well, that’s not quite it. When those things just arise impulsively without asking, and we respond, right? With awareness, with compassion, with mindfulness. Those are enlightened qualities.

And if the burden is light, then you carry it lightly. If it’s heavy, you carry it heavily. Don’t complain. Don’t complain. Don’t compare. Oh, now, wait a minute. Don’t speculate. Don’t strategize. Four tough asks, right? Because we love these things.

You know, somebody was asking about—it’s easy, easier, you know, to let go of things that are painful, come back to their practice. But when it’s pleasurable, it’s hard to let go of that because you’re getting pleasure right now. It’s happening, you’re enjoying this, it’s good, feels good, you must like it, it must be good. It’s hard to let go of that consciously and return to a practice that may not be those things, yet it’s not bringing forth all those wonderful descriptions: radiant, luminous, blissful, equanimous, liberated. It’s just the breath, right? So you’re going to let go—wow, come back to the breath, right? That’s not what we would normally do. We would normally stay with the good thing, the fun thing, the “I like” thing.

And so that’s where being able to practice what in that moment is difficult. It can sound very trivial, but in that moment, it can be hard.

Towards the end of the Ox Herding Pictures depiction of the journey, the ox self transcended, the poem says:

“Astride the ox I reach home, I’m serene.
The bull too can rest now, the dawn has come.
In blissful repose within my thatched dwelling,
I’ve abandoned the whip and ropes.”

All of those practices, those efforts, those struggles have eased.

There’s nothing we meet that really is new. I mean, that’s not entirely true—we do experience new things in meditation. But in terms of the habitual mind, the conditioned mind, the karmic mind—I mean, come on, really. I don’t—maybe now and then, doesn’t really matter. But the point is, we get so surprised. You know, we fall into a habit. We’ve fallen into it a thousand times, ten thousand times, right here in sesshin. And yet—poof—it’s like, what? Swept away.

So if you can let go, let go. If you can’t let go, if you won’t let go, know that you won’t let go. Know that you’re not letting go. Just know that. Don’t write a thesis on it. Just know that. If your faith is strong, practice with a strong faith. If it’s dim, practice with a dim faith. There’s no situation—as long as you have your mind—in which practice cannot occur. And it will be different. It will be different.

We need those differences. We need to go through all of those different conditions and situations in order to develop, in order to learn how to live in this world which is continually throwing stuff at us, near and far. And to study without investment—great aspiration, but not invested. Hold no opinion and recognize that all of this that’s arising is just arising. It’s just a moment, it’s not you. It’s not permanent. Don’t take it lightly, as Dogen says, but don’t add weight to it. It’s not the self, it’s just an event. We’re not only event planners, we’re event makers. We’re making events all the time. But if we see it as just an event, and it’s gone...

In the Prajnaparamita, it is said, the Buddha has said that it’s hard to come up to the supreme enlightenment. And that is said over and over again in this sutra. How difficult it is, how deep it is. So he’s just acknowledging that. But then Subhuti—and, of course, Subhuti and Shariputra are both very, you know, prominent disciples of the Buddha—Subhuti says, “As I, however, understand the meaning of the Buddha’s teaching, and as I think it out for myself, easy to win is the supreme enlightenment. Easy, easy, easy. Why? No one fully knows. By no one is anything fully known. And there is nothing that should be fully known. For the Buddha, all dharmas are empty. And when all dharmas are empty, that dharma does not exist which would fully know, or by which one would fully know, or which one would fully know. They cannot be grasped. For all dharmas are empty. And because of this, easy to win is the great enlightenment.”

Because they are empty. It’s exactly what Subhuti was saying or Shariputra was saying. They’re just looking at it from a different perspective, that’s all. Same reality, same teaching, same truth. Because it’s empty, it is difficult. It is difficult to take this grasping mind, this object-seeking mind, this self-seeking other on this path, which needs to have a beginning and an end. It’s difficult. But because it cannot be grasped, then what is it that I’m attaching to? Why is it that this emotion has such an influence on me, has such power over me, if it has no power of its own?

I was listening to a teacher talk about—he was using his—it was Alan Wallace, and he was using his cell phone, and he picked it up and he looked at it and said, “There’s a dent on the back. Oh, it was so beautiful. It was perfect. It was brand new and it’s got a dent in it. How did that happen? Now it’s dented, it’s broken. It’s not the same. I can’t enjoy it, because it still works, but every time I pick it up, I just see that dent. I can’t see anything else.” And he went on for a while—very simple, trivial example, maybe not so trivial. And then he said, “If the power was in the dent, and that’s what was making me miserable, then I could turn it on you. You’d all be miserable.” Because it’s easy, it’s empty. Because it’s empty, it’s easy.

And then Ling Zhao has the last word: “Neither difficult nor easy. On the hundred grass tips, the ancestors.” Meaning, on the tip of a grass, on the tip of every blade of grass, the truth of this Dharma. Well, what is that? Neither easy nor difficult.

We can think of the instruction or the teaching about not having an opinion, not grasping, rejecting, not naming—all these foundational, reactive, deeply habitual things that we do. I remember sitting—I remember I was working on this dairy farm in upstate many years ago. I was sitting one morning before I went in to work the cows, and I was noticing my impulse, my impulsive mind, to name everything, to identify everything that came up, you know? And I remember thinking, I guess that’s going to always be there, you know? I mean, I couldn’t imagine that my mind wouldn’t do that at some point, because it was just so consistent, so reliable, right? And then that started to change, right? Started to drop away, started to get softer, started not to be so reflexive.

And so when we don’t engage in those simple actions that actually have very deep roots—naming, opinion, judging, grasping, rejecting—all of those things are strengthening our suffering, strengthening the very things that we’re trying to free ourselves of. And so when we relax those, and when we relax the sense that you are doing something, you are holding on, you are rejecting, you have an opinion, you are comparing, you are meditating, your concentration is getting stronger, your mind is distracted—none of that is necessary in order to practice, in order to see, be alert and practice well.

And the more—or the less—that that self is brought forward: I am, I am, I am, I am. The less the self is brought forward, long before it’s realized, that self is becoming quiet. And that’s the essence of an enlightened being. And so we are bringing forth enlightened mind when we allow that self-consciousness, that self-witnessing, that self-naming. And when it does arise, don’t make a big deal about it. Doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t have any power. It’s not a problem. So when you just meet it as like as one of many sensations, it arises, it’s gone, it arises, it’s gone.

Later in the sutra, a couple pages later, Subhuti says, “Well, how then should a bodhisattva practice? How should we go forth?” And the Buddha makes it very clear—it’s very simple. If you want to know full enlightenment, behave towards beings with an even mind. With an even mind. Don’t produce an uneven mind, a mind that is dull, apathetic, asleep. And don’t produce a mind that is agitated, volatile. Bring forth a thought of benefit towards all beings. In other words, generate intentions, desires, thoughts, citta, to be of benefit towards others—a thought that is free from aversion. Treat each person as though they were your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your friend, your child, your relative, your neighbor, people you depend upon, people you care about. Become a person who abstains from taking life, from stealing, from clouding your mind, and so on. In other words, practice in accord with the precepts.

Practice is a Buddha practice. The paramitas. Give, give—it doesn’t matter what you give, it doesn’t have to be something. When we want to bring forth thoughts of benefit, we want to be giving. Then we cultivate a mind and a heart that has that kind of generosity, magnanimity, patience, vigor, concentration. Develop the practices—your mindfulness.

The Buddha says, practice the great friendliness and the great compassion, the four immeasurables. In other words, engage in the practices that have come down to us, that have been transmitted. Understand the Four Noble Truths, understand dukkha, relinquish attachments, realize the nature of your mind and follow the path. And do all of this, the Buddha says, without taking a basis in anything, without turning any of this into something fixed, solid, graspable, something to gain, something to lose, something that has its own power. 

In other words, practice as an enlightened being, within faith, within understanding, and in time, through direct experience, that there is nothing that is eternal except that which is never born. There is nothing that we can actually grasp in our mind other than our mind. There is no obstacle that we’re experiencing that is actually external to ourselves and doing something to us. There is adversity. There are difficult situations, absolutely. Buddhism has never denied that. The world is filled with them and filled with people making them, and sometimes we’re that person.

The path is not about living in a fantasy world. But it’s said, whatever those conditions are, whatever the moment is, whatever this day is, you have a mind and a path that is fundamentally, in and of itself, free, unbound. But we have to train. We have to train that mind, develop it, bring it forth, make it, make it happy.

One day, Layman Pang and Ling Zhao were out selling bamboo baskets. They were coming down off a bridge and he stumbled and fell. When she saw it, she ran and threw herself down next to him. And her father said, “What are you doing?” And she said, “I saw Papa fall to the ground, so I’m helping.” And he said, “Ah, thank goodness no one was looking.”

37851,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-05-18 12:59","BA40","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Feeding Your Demons","Lopon Karla","Good morning, everyone. It's so great to be here. I felt warmly welcomed, at home, well taken care of, which is really kind of good for me because I'm the kind of person that, oh, I can do it. Oh, I'll do it. Oh, I can do it. And it's really nice to be able to receive. So I want to thank everyone here for really supporting me in being able to share this teaching.

As you know, I am a senior teacher associated with Tara Mandala Retreat Center in Pagosa Springs. I practice Vajrayana, Tibetan Buddhism. And I'm going to take a moment now to raise bodhicitta, to raise the intention that this talk—you can hold your hands in prayer, or as we do, a one-pointed mudra, middle fingers out, rest of the fingers folded down like an arrow, the arrow of our focus. But either way is acceptable.

I want to begin by acknowledging the indigenous folk of this land—the Mohawk Confederacy, the Iroquois Confederacy. May their wisdom be present with us today. I also invoke and call in my ancestors, the ancestors of those who are present today, those who have helped us, because without them, we would not be here. And I honor and acknowledge and aspire that their wisdom will be present. I invoke all of the wisdom beings of all of the traditions represented here. May their wisdom be present. I acknowledge and honor all of the Dharma protectors, the Dharmapala and the local protectors. May they continue to protect us as we walk our path. And connecting to my heart, I raise a heartfelt motivation that this talk will be a benefit to ourselves, to all beings everywhere, without one exception. Thank you.

This weekend I had the opportunity to share the Feeding Your Demons practice, which really is ancient wisdom for resolving inner conflict. Numbers of us learned the practice. Feeding Your Demons was developed by Lama Tsultrim Allione to help her students transform and address the underlying issues, conflicts, habitual behaviors that often get in the way. They get in the way of our everyday life. They get in the way and sometimes create obstacles for our even being able to practice, to deepen our practice.

And FYD, as we call it, Feeding Your Demons, is a westernized version of the Tibetan Buddhist Chöd practice. Chöd was developed in Tibet by an 11th-century Tibetan woman. This is highly unusual because most of the practices that come from Tibet have been developed or initiated by men. And for a while, women couldn't even be educated to read and write—just how it was. But Machig was born into a family that was pretty well off, and her parents were practitioners. Both her mother and father recognized at her birth that this was a special being. As in many Tibetan stories, she had certain marks. She had, like, a very, very tiny—looked like a third eye here. Her fingers were webbed. She could read, and she learned to read very early. She would read the Prajnaparamita Sutra, which, of course, at one point was 8,000 lines, at another point was 25,000 lines. So, wealthy people would hire her to come and read the sutra, primarily because there would be a generation of merit. And the more you could read a full sutra, the more merit could be generated, the more benefit could be gleaned.

She would read within her community and was known for this. Of course, as many of us—you know, sometimes you read something and you think you get it. You think you know it. Particularly with Dharma, right? It's like, oh, nature of mind. All right, I get that. And I know I don't. I can't even explain it to somebody, right? So it's this way of, like, oh. And at one point she was asked, do you really know what it means? And she recognized, no. So she went on, and she studied further. She became a nun, practicing.

When she talks about demons, what are these things called demons? What they are not are Hollywood projections. What they are not really is something outside of ourselves. What Machig says in her teachings is: what we call demons are not materially existing individuals with huge, dark forms, frightening and terrifying anyone who sees them. A demon really refers to anything that hinders liberation—usually anything in us that hinders liberation.

We can often think, you know, it's so easy to other, right? It's like, it's your problem. No, that's not my—if you would only—if you would only be kind to—if you would only listen to me—because you're the issue. No, you're not the issue. I'm the issue, and it's my issue. So Chöd and Feeding Your Demons really help us look at that in a healthy, transformative way.

Demons are our fears, our negative self-talk, our illnesses, our perseverating thoughts. Down the rabbit hole I go—what are they doing? Things happen to us in life, but they operate to block us. They operate to create obstacles for feeling free.

In ancient times, Chöd practitioners would travel from village to village and perform the Chöd ritual to heal humans and to heal animals. And yet they did not become ill. Some of this is because the traditional Chöd practice is designed to help practitioners cut through ego clinging, cut through ego fixation, cut through the concepts. We hold that this vehicle I'm traveling in is the real deal. If we hold the view in Buddhism, this is not the real deal. This is an illusion. Emptiness, luminosity is the absolute. But again, we're in 3D reality, so it makes it a little difficult to lean into that all the time. Hence, we practice. We keep diving deeper and deeper and deeper.

So Chöd practitioners, in some ways, as they practice, there would be nothing for an illness to hold onto. The word Chöd means to sever. So the whole process is to continue to cut through the fear—the fear of what might be here, the fear of failure, the fear of this energy that might be lurking behind me. It doesn't exist in and of itself. Chöd is a practice that keeps reminding us about that.

Sometimes in the West, we often think that anything that's negative needs to be defeated. We should conquer it. People say, you need to conquer your fears, crush them, cut them out, destroy them. And in some ways, that is problematic. It's problematic because often we can't stuff them in a drawer enough so that they don't come out, right? Maybe we do conquer them for a moment, but then there's a little bit that peeks out from the side. So we're taught to fight, we're taught to conquer.

The teachings of Machig shift that in terms of shifting the paradigm. Machig's teachings offer us another option. They do show us that when you offer anything exactly what it needs, it relaxes. So in the West, we say, oh my gosh, if you feed a negative feeling, it's just going to grow. Well, maybe you're not feeding it the right diet. Because in actuality, if you offer something to someone that they truly need, at the core of their being, whatever tensions they might be walking with, whatever aggressions they might manifest, that just relaxes because it fits, because it integrates, because what was two parts becomes whole. Machig again—her gift to us: feed, not fight.

In terms of this idea, where did she come up with this? Right? I mean, she grew up in a world where people were warriors, where people were fighting, even practicing the Dharma. So we know that she could read Prajnaparamita Sutra, she became a nun, she studied with many lamas. And there was a moment—some of you have heard this—where she was receiving a very secret initiation. And in this initiation, as the lama was reading the text, Machig levitates from her cushion. And actually she does a little, what they call a dakini dance, where she moves: left foot raised, right foot waves, left foot raised, dancing between Samsara and Nirvana. And then she floats through the wall of the gompa.

Now, some of you are like, well, that's a pretty fantastic trick. But in ancient Tibet, people could do these kinds of things. They manifested the siddhis so often. But we could say that she was so deep in meditation that she was tapping in to absolute reality. She floats out and lands in a tree. This tree is located by this lake. The lake is ruled by a very fierce, angry, frightening Naga, this water spirit. People would walk far away. They wouldn't walk near this. He was so terrifying.

She lands in his tree in meditative equipoise. And of course, he's like, well, who the heck is this? What? How dare she? And he rises up and comes at her to attack her. And she remains in meditative equipoise, communicating: take what you need, do what you will. He's like, well, maybe she really doesn't know who I am. So he conjures up his minions. So we have big Nagas, little Nagas coming at her, right? She remains in meditative equipoise, communicating: take what you need. No fear, no doubt, just in the true nature.

In the moment when he attacks her the second time, he is transformed and commits himself to protecting the Dharma and protecting Dharma practitioners. And in Tibet, there are numbers of stories about these demons, these manifestations of beings that are doing harm to many, many people. And they're pretty arrogant in the idea that I am the baddest, I am the biggest, I am the meanest, and nobody can stop me. Nobody, not over here, not over there, nobody can stop me. And they have pride in how many people they have harmed.

Well, there's a story about a protector, Mahakala, who was really creating so much negative karma that Tara and Avalokiteshvara come together and really have a conversation. Could you please stop? And he's like—laughs—you can't make me stop. What do they do? Do they annihilate him? Absolutely not. What they do is they offer him compassion and, in fact, flood his heart with compassion to the point where he suddenly experiences regret for all of his transgressions and then dedicates his life to protecting practitioners and the Dharma.

So we have a lot of themes of this transformation of something that might be experienced as negative into something that becomes a support, that becomes an ally. Feeding Your Demons operates in that way.

I'm going to ask you to just for a moment think about a time when you were really thirsty—I mean really thirsty—to the point that all you could focus on was getting a cool drink to quench your thirst. And maybe you had tasks to do. Maybe you were writing a Dharma talk, maybe you were ready to practice. But how could you do that? Because all you needed was a drink of water. So you can feel the tension. You can feel the—I have to have it. Can I get it? And then what happens when you take that first sip? The first sip goes in your mouth. You feel the cool water on your tongue. You feel the water going down your throat. And sometimes what happens is your body begins to relax. That's what happens in the Feeding Your Demons process—the inner tension, our conflicts, through that process, get transformed. And we can be more at ease, more open, maybe even feeling a little bit of liberation, a little bit of expansiveness, freedom, opening.

And so this ancient practice, Chöd, is the root of Feeding Your Demons, that we get to look at what blocks us. We feed it what it really needs through a process that combines Buddhist practice and Western psychology. And we discover an ally. Sometimes whatever issue or demon we're working with is directly connected to the ally. We can see the relationship. Sometimes we don't. But often in our life, having an ally is so useful. It's like when we find the right teacher for ourselves, right? The right teacher for me—in some instances, I can just relax a little bit again. That fit.

Feeding Your Demons encourages us to integrate the parts of ourselves that we have cast off, that we've turned our back on, that we've denied. And what do they want? They want some attention. They want some love. They need some compassion. Or how else will we integrate that? And so Feeding Your Demons really helps us relax the inner tension that we experience when we live in dualism, like hopes and fears. I hope I'll be able to get home safely. I'm afraid I might be in an accident. I hope—think about how often you may be living between hope and fear. I hope that I'll be able to sit through meditation still and drop in. I'm afraid I'm not going to. I'm afraid my discursive thoughts are going to take over. I mean, all of those ways in which we're like in between and the tension. Feeding Your Demons helps us relax that.

There are many benefits of this practice to support us on the path, but also to help us in our life. So we know relaxing that inner tension, and as I said, on a psychological level, can foster this integration of the parts of ourselves that we are rejecting, which might be functioning as obstacles. Self-doubt—I have that one big time. You know, no matter how many times I've done something, oh my gosh, is the teaching going to be good enough? Am I going to cover everything that needs to be covered? You know? Oh, no, you can't do—quiet. Well, I can't just quiet it. What would be great is if I said, what is it you truly need? How would you feel if you get what you truly need? An answer may be I'd feel secure. Okay. In a Feeding Your Demons practice, I would offer security, and I don't have to worry about what that might look like. So psychologically, we can actually have integration.

On a spiritual level, Feeding Your Demons does help us remove obstacles to our practice. It can definitely foster a deepening of our meditation practices. It can help us manifest a form of fierce compassion in the world. And boy, do we need fierce compassion right now—the compassion that holds the line, the compassion that goes into any area. There was a time that I used to think that Green Tara was just soft, you know, compassion is sweet compassion. There she sits, looking so lovely. Until I recognized that Tara will go anywhere where beings are suffering—into the bellies of the world. I was like, wow, that takes some courage. It's like, oh no, there's strength here. There's power in compassion. So Feeding Your Demons can help us manifest that right now for the benefit of others.

When we step on the Buddhist path, being a Buddhist requires courage. It requires a steadfastness. It requires the ability to look at suffering. No, don't turn away. Look. Look at it. Witness it. And then maybe you can offer something that could shift it, that could lessen it. Because we are practicing for the benefit of ourselves and the benefit of all sentient beings. That's a big task. I mean, I think about, you know, in my practice and often in my practices, it says, ""I single-handedly..."" It's like, whoa, I don't know if I can do that. And I said, yes, I do that every time I practice. So this interconnection and this interrelatedness—again, Feeding Your Demons allows us to transform something that is an obstacle into something that is a support—from demon to ally. And the allies actually are our own innate wisdom, our own inner knowing. How wonderful that we can access that.

Feeding Your Demons reminds us that we have the capacity to be our own allies. It helps us move away from obscurations, drop the veil of ignorance, and just rest in our true nature—our true nature, luminous, shining in the ten directions, connected to everything and everyone. One taste, as we say. So again, feed, not fight. Paying attention and caring for the parts of us that we discarded. Nobody likes to be discarded. We don't like to be rejected. And think about, well, why might I be doing that to myself? Why is that happening in my psyche? Maybe I could just be with what is for a little bit, look at it, and then ask or see what it truly needs.

We can think of Feeding Your Demons practice as transforming obstacles into opportunities. And sometimes I'm like, oh, come on. An obstacle into an opportunity? That feels like a reach. I'm kind of tired. Come on, opportunities to practice. It's like, uh huh. Well, sometimes my practice doesn't feel like an opportunity. No, to be transparent, it's like, all right, I have to. And yet, often—actually, always—there's benefit, right? But we get to remove those. It's like sweeping—sweep out the dust and then you can see the floor, how clear it is.

Feeding Your Demons practice helps us enhance our bodhicitta. It helps us in terms of walking the bodhisattva path. Bodhicitta—awakened mind, right, awakened heart-mind. That space where we hold our compassion. And in these chaotic, troubling times, we want to be able to really call in our bodhicitta. We want to actually even maybe manifest radical bodhicitta. Take it out, take the aspiration for all beings to not be in suffering, take it out into the world, which many of us, many of us do, right? But we need fierce compassion now. We need to look, we sometimes need to say, something's wrong here. This can't—this should not happen.

So the Feeding Your Demons practice can clear out what might get in the way of our walking with our aspirational bodhicitta into the bodhicitta of action. Feeding Your Demons cuts through spiritual bypass. No spiritual bypass here. There's no time for denial. And we all know you can't meet anger and aggression with anger and aggression. And yet, how long have humans been doing that? Machig offers another option.

Each time we practice, we meet ourselves. It can be really beneficial to access some of what we refer to as skillful means—the technology, our practices that help us to reach in or touch into the wisdom that is available, to the wisdom that's right here, wherever here is. When we practice, we often do meet what Machig would refer to as maras—these demons, these obstacles. And we also experience wisdom when we truly face our inner shadow, maras or demons. When we stare directly into the face of what haunts us, when we do not look away, resist or aggress, we can see clearly—that pristine clarity. It's like turning on the light: Dharma in a dark room, samsara—all is dissolved in Dharma, into the ground of being.

There's no need to be afraid. There's no need to run to a protected space. When we embrace our shadow, when we embrace the ego clinging, self clinging, we can lose the distinctions between others and ourselves. We then have the opportunity to create a new relationship with others and with phenomena. At that moment of recognition, we are better able to rest in equanimity.

Machig Labdrön and Lama Tsultrim Allione have gifted us the powerful and immediate methods to identify and transform these obstacles, these things that plague us, these things that block our freedom and liberation. Feeding Your Demons provides a method for meeting the muck of our inner lives and transforming that into the lotus we truly are. Through Feeding Your Demons and transforming what blocks us into what supports our liberation—and this quote comes directly from the Chöd practice—we are victorious in all directions so that whomever we meet will be benefited.

Shugan Roshi is the head of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of the monastery. This talk, like all of our talks, is offered free of charge. If you would like to make a donation or find out more about our various programs, visit us online at zmm.org. Thank you for listening.

This is from the Book of Serenity, Mu and Yunmen's Sound and Form pointer:

Not cutting off sound and form is falling. Wherever you are, searching by way of sound and looking by way of form, you don't see Buddha. Isn't there anyone who can take to the road and return home?

Yunmen one day said to the assembly, “Hearing sound, awaken to the Way. Seeing form, understand the mind. The Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara brings money to buy a sesame cake. When she lowers her hand, it turns out to be a jelly donut.”

Hongzhi’s verse:
Going out the gate, making the horse leap,
Sweeping away the comets,
The smoke and dust of 10,000 countries is spontaneously clear.
The 12 media are free of useless images and echoes.
Pure light emanates in a billion worlds.

So, we're completing our ongoing intensive this morning and I don't know how to describe what it was in my mind. It was many things, so I'll let it be that. But I wanted to talk a little bit about art practice this morning—one of our areas of training—drawing from the particular relationship with the arts in the Zen tradition.

In Buddhism, most of the arts have a function as a meditation, as an aspect of meditation, as something that is brought into meditation. There’s also the aspect of how something is created: that it is created within a mind, within a mind of Buddha, within a mind of meditation. So process and result are merged in the Zen tradition. Zen masters—Hakuin, others—who are poets, painters, painter-priests, offered pieces of creative expression, poetry, paintings, and so on, as teachings.

And then Daido Roshi, in his own path as a photographer—he talked about when he first met someone, Nakagawa Roshi and then Eido Roshi, in Daibosatsu, and was interested but was wary of Buddhism, of Zen, of religion. But he offered to spend time there, photographing, because he was a photographer and offered those photographs. He wasn’t ready to enter the gate. He wasn’t ready to begin practicing, but he, I guess, was trying to find a way in and then eventually, of course, did and brought that gate of training into our practice here from the very beginning.

And because he was a photographer, he kept shooting his whole life; it was just what he did. When video cameras came out, I remember he rented the first video camera. We couldn’t afford it. We didn’t have money, and they were very expensive. So I remember he rented one from Sears and started making films and exploring, continuing his photographic artistry through videos, which he was very excited about. He created a little sort of studio at the Abbey’s studio where he would put those together. Particularly in his later life, his relationship with the arts and the way that came into his teaching became more and more, I think, prominent and present. He spoke very, very often about the arts and our practice and his own relationship with creativity.

So, not cutting off sound and form is falling wherever you are. Searching by way of sound and form and looking, you don’t see the Buddha. That is drawing from the Diamond Sutra, where the Buddha said, “If you see me in form, if you hear me, recognize me by sound, by my voice, you don’t see the Buddha, you’re not seeing Buddha.”

So what does it mean to see Buddha? Does an enlightened being not see, not hear? How do we inhabit this dharma body? We talked about that in various ways during the weekend. How do we, as a sentient being—right? We can think of our senses as the places in which we get caught. In fact, the senses are often spoken of as thieves. It’s where we get stolen away from ourselves by going out into our senses and getting confused.

In the poem where it says, “the 12 media are free of useless images and echoes,” the 12 media are your senses: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or skin, and mind, and then the objects in the respective fields of those sense organs. The poem is saying, as Hongzhi says, they are free of useless images and echoes. We might think that means in a state of samadhi where there is no seeing, no hearing. And that’s true, but it’s talking about at all times being free, not being deceived.

How do we inhabit this dharma body, this true person of no rank? The eyes and ears are clear. Nagarjuna might say, “Well, we do see something with the eyes. There is something in front of you. We do hear something with the ears.” But what is the nature of that which we see? That’s the question the Buddha Dharma is asking. What is the nature of that which we hear? Are we hearing in a way that is true, that is reliable?

We talked over the last couple of days about teachings about how, because of dependent origination, because we get lost in things, we project our ideas, our views, our karmic history, our experiences, our wants, our likes and dislikes in through our senses, through our mind, through our consciousness, into our perceptions. Those perceptions are intrinsically then unreliable, unstable—one, because they’re impermanent, but also because we’re projecting ourselves onto it. So what are we actually seeing?

And we can think of that as, you know, so what if what you’re looking at is a bowl of fruit or a tree or something—that may not matter to you, but you’re still relating to it, it’s still in your world. But what about when that object is a person—someone you love, a stranger, someone who’s acting in a way that you don’t like, you don’t agree with, somebody who doesn’t look like you? We see the consequences of that. That’s the long, troubled story of humanity, still trying to work that out. So what is the nature of that which we see?

The Buddha said, that is what we call the world: what I see, what I hear, what I perceive. If we take the sounds and forms as the true person, the Buddha said, you cannot see me—which is another way of saying, you will not see yourself.

We talked yesterday about that fundamental sense of distance, isolation, alienation, loneliness, estrangement. Why does that seem to occur within human beings, wherever we are? Why does that seem to show up in various ways in our various religious traditions, a recognition that in some way we have lost something, become distant from something, and need to find our way back? Is there anyone who can take to the road and return home?

Well, that then begs the question: what is home? Is it here? Is it up in heaven? Is it somewhere else? Is it in this time? Is it another time?

We were looking at some of the writings of Evelyn Underhill in her book on mysticism. So I want to just read a little bit. She said, “The conscious self sits, so to speak, at the end of a telegraph wire.” That is, our senses. Information comes in. She said it seems to most people to be the one channel of communication with the hypothetical external world. So she’s already suggesting that what we take as the fixed, solid, inarguable world might be up for question.

The receiving instrument registers certain messages. The receiver, she said, does not know—and as long as she remains dependent on that instrument, can never know—the object, the reality at the other end of the wire by which those messages are sent.

So when the Buddha considered not teaching because what he was going to teach, what he wanted to try and point to, could not be pointed to, could not be experienced with the senses. But then, when we take that for the world and when we assume that that which I’m experiencing is what everybody’s experiencing—my world is the world—we don’t think of it in terms of an individual, personalized world. That’s the fundamental bias of the self: my assumption that my experiences, which—if I don’t recognize—are the result of a lifetime of karma and thoughts and experiences and beliefs and so on, if I’m not aware of that, then it just seems like I open my eyes and I just see what is objectively there. “It’s just not there. It’s just that, surely you’re seeing the wrong thing.” So when we’re in disagreement, “What’s wrong with you?”

She says, “The sphere of our possible intellectual knowledge is strictly conditioned by the limits of our own personality. On this basis, not the ends of the earth, but the external termini of our own sensory nature—nerves are the termini, the endpoint of our explorations. That’s it. That’s all we need to know. And to know oneself is really just to know your universe. We don’t need to examine ourselves.”

It’s one of the things that I see coming up with practitioners sometimes who are in relationship with partners or family members who may not have a relationship with looking for a road by which to return home. They may not have something in their lives which is somehow inward-turning. There are people in my life who are like that. And so then, to such a person, it cannot make sense. Like, “Why do you need to do this? Why do you need to go and sit and look inward? Why don’t we, I mean, just live? Why do you need to take this time away from me, from us, to do something that I don’t get, you know, I don’t understand. Isn’t this enough? Aren’t I enough?” See how that can be challenging, threatening. Right?

That’s oftentimes what I’ll ask: Does your partner have any kind of relationship with something in which they reflect, they examine, they have some access to a world that’s not just out there?

And so then she talks about those few people, she says, who realize acutely and persist that there is, she says, a type of personality which does not realize this limitation—or I would say at some point doesn’t accept it, doubts it. “There has to be something more and cannot be content with the sham realities that furnish the universe of normal people. It is necessary, it seems, to the comfort of persons of this type—seekers—to form for themselves some image of something or nothing which is at the end of these lines of communication or perception, some conception of being, some theory of knowledge, something.” How do you even speak of it? She says they are “tormented by the unknowable. An ache for first principles demands some background to the shadow show of things. Insofar as people possess this temperament, they hunger for reality and must satisfy that hunger as best they can, staving off starvation.”

A real thirst, a good thirst that the Buddha realized can be quenched. It’s not the thirst of the hungry ghost that is unquenchable because of its very nature, but this is to be quenched. That’s why experiencing that ache, as she speaks of it, that discomfort—you know, were there any moments in your practice, if you’ve been practicing long enough, as it were, for me, where I thought, “Why can’t I just, like, shut up about all this?” Right? “Forget about it, go back, go on, be happy. It’s enough.” Always in difficult moments, right? Tormented by the unknowable.

The 19th century Otaka Kaki Rengetsu, Zen nun, teacher, poet, said:
“Heart drifting like white clouds from beginning to end.
A thing of mystery is this heart, and mystery contains.”

I think this can contain the sense of something that is not easily knowable—not knowable in the old way, but is something we can encounter. There is a road home, and at the same time it can possess the quality of, “you will never know this.” That’s not its function, that’s not what’s needed. There’s something else here.

Daido Roshi used to talk a lot about the sort of connection between the creative process and dharma practice, where we are focused on something, we’re engaging in something, we’re encountering something that isn’t just an intellectual process. There’s something else going on in this realm—it’s creative expression. There’s a medium, right? We’re using something, our body’s involved, and something is trying to be communicated. Something is trying to be encountered.

And in our practice, the emphasis is always: let it be true. So when you see your mind going towards, “Do I like this? Do I not like this? Does this actually look like a... What will other people think? This doesn’t make sense.” When it starts to get intellectual, you come back, come back, come back, come back.

Think of the haiku: a simple three-line verse that originates out of a direct experience of something simple, going out on a spring day and then trying to convey the sense of that—not describing. So if it’s something to convey the sense of spring, you can’t use the word spring, right? How do you convey the sense so that somebody reading that haiku smells the air, the spring air, feels the cool breeze? It’s conveying the experience, right? And so then we have to be intimate with that experience and then let it be manifest.

He used to talk about the muse. He talked about when he went out west once—I forget the name of the area, but it was on the coast, the west coast. There are some of the photographs downstairs from that trip that he took. He said he got so intoxicated by these visual images and the photography, and he was just getting so that he thought he was going to faint. So he actually went inward, inland—not inward, and sat down. And just, he said, was overtaken by the muse. He was so excited and just filled.

Evelyn Underhill said that mysticism, the mystic path, is the art of union with reality—a road to take us home to here. To here.

So what is creative expression? I remember somebody many years ago talking about asking Daido, because he was a truck driver, and he said, “Could driving my truck be my art practice?” And Daido said, “No.” He said, “But there’s a creative element to it.” He said, “Save it.” He said, “No, whatever that is, fine, but try something new. Try something else here.” When I first was here, because I was a musician and I had my instrument, every ango I would try and take up my flute. It was a natural thing to do, make that my art practice. But it was so hard. I just kept reverting to my training, reverting to what I knew as a classical musician, which had a very particular way. It was very hard for me to be new, to be a beginner, to be a student. So I stopped doing that, and I just started working with a brush and paper, which I hadn’t done since I was in grade school. I had no investment in it. I had no history. I didn’t need to be good at it. It was great. And for the first time, I felt like, okay, I think I’m starting to get some sense of what my teacher’s talking about. And then I was able to come back to the flute. Geimon and I used to do things together where she would do movement and I would improvise, basically. And then I could come back to it having sort of gained a little bit of understanding through a different medium in which I didn’t have a personal investment. That’s what I had a hard time letting go of with the flute.

And so we can think about creative expression as communicating, sharing, something that arises when we are in contact, both within and without, and something that is to be shared. And so, what is that? When the self is bound within grasping, what might the creative expression then be? What might it be when that grasping is being released? It’s not so strong, but the self is still very much present. So of course there is grasping, but it’s softening. And then what is it when grasping and selflessness is realized or let go of in that moment of creation? It’s compassion.

Somebody asked yesterday, because we were talking about prayer, and somebody asked if zazen could be prayerful. And I said, “That’s a wonderful question. Let’s just leave that as a question. Don’t rush to an answer. Don’t try and come up with an answer. Explore. Will it have compassion within it? Selfless thoughts, words, and actions to not create harm?”

Ryokan, the priest-poet, wrote:
“The rain has stopped, the clouds have drifted away and the weather’s clear again.
If your heart is pure, then all things in your world are pure.
Abandon this fleeting world, abandon yourself.
Then the moon and flowers will guide you along the way.”

When the heart, the mind become clear, fresh, new, the world is clear, fresh, and new. It’s still samsara; there’s still much, much trouble going on. But we perceive it differently because the world is mind.

I was thinking of many years ago when I was first living in the city. It was late 70s, early 80s, performance art was happening. And I would go to different performances, often in basements and dark and, you know, scary places. And I remember being in a performance with a couple. It was a very small room. We were in chairs. They were right in front of us. We could almost touch them. There was a television with Richard Nixon giving a speech. And the two people were doing something—I couldn’t really understand what was going on. But they had a tape recorder with another speech going on that was on the end of a rope. And they started—he started swinging it over his head. And then he started letting out the rope. So it was getting closer and closer. And then they started throwing bananas. And I thought, “This is bullshit. This is just bullshit.” And afterwards, you know, some people were really agitated. And I was watching the performers and I thought, “Oh, that’s the point. That’s what you were going for. You just wanted to piss everybody off. Well done.”

And Daido Roshi used to talk about the responsibility, you know, just because I created it, just because it’s something—like, there’s a responsibility. Just like what I think, just like what I say, just like what I do, I have a responsibility. It doesn’t mean it always has to be nice and pretty and beautiful. It doesn’t mean that we have to avoid any disagreement or conflict at all or strong emotion. But to take responsibility for it, to not wantonly inflict it upon each other as though there’s something noble or artistic—there’s a responsibility.

When Geimon was a dancer (my partner), and she was—I'm biased, but I thought she was an extraordinary dancer, it’s how I first met her—was when she was on stage and had a real talent. If you’re listening to this, I hope this is okay. She was very gifted, and I could see that. I think other people could see that. And when she left dance, there were a lot of people who were not happy about that and were like, “How can you walk away from this?” And she and I used to talk about, you know, if somebody has a gift, do they have a responsibility to use that gift? Do you have to be an artist? Do you have to dance? Do you have to be—if you’re a prodigy on the violin, do you have to play the violin? Like, are you somehow bound by that, to use it in that particular way? It could do a lot of good. It could bring a lot of joy, it could inspire. It’s like, if you have something that could be really helpful, do you have to use it in that way? Are there other ways you could use it?

So, hearing sound, awaken to the Way; seeing form, understand the mind. Then Yunmen says, and this is basic practice: by entering into the sound, entering into the form, the only way to enter is to leave the self behind, let it relax. Of course, it’s not a thing; you’re not leaving anything anywhere. You’re just not invoking it, not producing it, not self-creating. And so, then what is it?

And so there are many, many koans that do that. A student asked Master Zhaozhou, “What is the true dharma?” And Zhaozhou said, “That oak tree in the garden.” And the student said, “Master, don’t point to something in the phenomenal, conditioned, impermanent, samsaric world to reveal something that is unconditioned and free.” And he said, “I don’t point to something of the samsaric world that is conditioned and impermanent.” And the student says, “Well, then, what is the true dharma?” And Zhaozhou said, “The oak tree in the garden.”

What did Zhaozhou see? What did the monk see? They were both seeing a tree. The monk only saw a tree. He was only seeing his mind’s image of something.

And so then Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara brings money to buy a sesame cake. But when she lowers her hand, it’s a jelly donut. It’s classic Yunmen, right? You can imagine studying with this teacher, right? Because so many of his teachings are like this. I remember when I came to this koan, I thought, “Oh, what?” Because it’s not logical. Obviously, it’s not logical. And so what does it mean to enter into this?

Hear the cries of the world. She goes into the market to buy a sesame cake to alleviate all suffering. But when she lowers her hand, it’s a jelly donut. Doesn’t she know what’s going on? Isn’t she in control? Does she know the difference between a sesame cake and a jelly donut? Going beyond sound and form, there is a tree. What is the nature of that tree? What else is it?

When we sit down on the cushion, you’re a person. You come from such and such. You’ve done this and that. You live here. You have these possessions, these memories. That’s the bark, the branches—what else? What are you not? When you leave that behind, what remains? The Buddha said, now you can see Buddha. Now you are seeing Buddha.

Rumi wrote:
“Dissolver of sugar, dissolve me.
If this is the time, do it gently, with a touch of a hand or a look.
Every morning I wait at dawn. That’s when it happened before.
Or do it suddenly, like an execution.
How else could I get ready for death?
You breathe without a body. Like a spark.
You grieve. And I begin to feel lighter.
You keep me away with your arm.
But your keeping away just pulls me in.
I will not be kept away no more. Enough.”

And so we practice within sound and form to free ourselves of sound and form. The Buddha said, one of the entanglements is in rites and rituals, sounds and forms. I spoke during the weekend about why it was so important to Daido Roshi that liturgy is part of our training, so we’re not just ringing bells, doing prostrations without understanding, so that we can just ring a bell, just bow, see Buddha, return home.

And then in our practice, to bring that out. Because the moment you touch the brush to the paper, you make a sound, you make a movement, you utter a word, that’s your mind. And of course, the deal is everyone’s seeing it. Okay, let’s lay that bare.

I was thinking with Mother’s Day, I was thinking of my mother, Nels, and I was thinking of many things because she was many things. But she was a teacher in my high school, and for a while, and she taught the troubled kids, the troubled youth. They all sent them to my mom, the school sent them to my mom. She was supposed to get them right, you know, and she pretty quickly realized, you know, I don’t think everybody has to go to school all the time. She just tried to find out, what do you love? What do you care about? What turns you on? And she just tried to move them in that direction.

But she was telling us one night at dinner, my family, she said she got so tired of these kids cussing. They were always cussing—each other, at her. And one day she said, “Enough. I am so bored with this. You just use the same old language. So, look, we’re just going to get it all out. Write them on the board, and then you can’t use these words ever again. If you want to be nasty, you have to come up with different kinds of words.” So they—and of course, she said they got so into this, right? She said she was a little worried about what she had unleashed, right? She said they were coming up with words she’d never even heard of. So the whole board’s filled, and of course, there’s lots of sounds going on. And so the principal walks in. She’s already got a reputation in the school. And so the kids are like... And my mom’s looking at him and the board and him, and as she starts to open up, he goes, “I don’t even want to hear it.” And he just walked out. Yeah, she was pretty cool.

If zazen is a time to be released from the need to control, to manage, to fix—I mean, if we can really get that, is that not a relief? Is that not a relief? You don’t have to do that. In fact, if you do that, it’s going to get harder. That doesn’t keep us from trying, because that’s our habit. But ultimately, we have to understand, if there’s one moment, one time in the day when you trust enough to give that up within—that doesn’t mean just do whatever within your meditation. And so it means within that form, within the discipline, within the correctness of true meditation, there is letting go of control. There is a letting go of managing, of trying to fix.

So then we can think of our practice as also a time to be released from the need to be right, to be approved, to be skillful, to be creative. You know, it’s been said many times that, you know, when we’re young, as children, everybody’s an artist. And then at a certain point, that just stops.

I had an art teacher in grade school, Mrs. Lawson. Mrs. Lawson. She was a country woman, and she was the art teacher. And she would mostly sit at the table and just direct. And I remember bringing her a painting I’d done. She says, “Let me see what you’ve done, honey.” And I put it down. She said, “Well, now, isn’t that nice?” And then she picked up a pen or some crayons. She said, “What if I did this?” And then she redid the whole thing. I swear to God. And then she gave it back to me. She said, “Now, isn’t that nice? Isn’t that better? Don’t you like that?” Now, lesson learned. I get it.

So that comes up for a lot of people in our practice. “No, I don’t do that. I’m not creative. I can’t do that. I’m not good at that.” Okay, this is the time when you don’t have to be good. How about that? That’s what I did for myself when I started doing painting. I had to be good at the flute—I mean, for God’s sake—but painting, I didn’t have to be good. I had an excuse, right? I don’t know anything about it. It was a relief. It’s freeing. And then can we come back to something that we maybe have skill in, training at, history with?

She goes to buy a sesame cake. Lowering her hand, it’s a jelly donut. Things take shape. Sounds have certain qualities, but they are not fixed. We do not need to fix them. And that does not deny, it doesn’t distort—it actually frees us from the distortion. When we apply that to the world or we allow the world to be what it is, it’s vibrant, alive, dancing, it’s got ki—energy, aliveness. When we do that with each other, we’ve got buddhas, sentient beings, dignity, respect. We’ve got compassion, you might say. We have prayer manifested.

Going out the gate, making the horse leap, sweeping away the comets—these images, these phrases that are about being on the road, returning home, departing, letting go, shoving off, dropping the rope, untying the knot so that the smoke and dust of 10,000 countries can finally be seen to be clear. And sometimes that spontaneous clear is a ravaged mountain or a war zone or an angry face, a hatred made manifest. And it’s painful and it’s destructive. It is destroying. And within that, there is something that is beyond right and wrong and completely understands, can now understand the destructiveness without forsaking the person, without responding to hatred with hatred, without responding to dislike with dislike.

I’m thinking of one of our senior students who was in a, I think, a Gay Pride march many years ago. And the march got stuck, you know, as it does sometimes. Everybody’s just standing still. And she was standing—there were some other people, and there were some people in the crowd who were just hateful, screaming, yelling hateful things, and they were just stuck there. And she said, without really knowing what she was doing or thinking, she just went over and started doing prostrations. That’s love. That’s loving your enemy. Who knows what happens in such a moment, right? What does that person filled with hatred do with that? What do they do with that? I don’t know. But a message is being sent and something is being received. It’s worth considering.

So I’ll end with a poem:
Full bright, luminous moon fills the woods and shadows,
But it’s the barest sliver, fine curve of moon that I love the most.
Though it contains the whole, only this thin beauty is revealed.

The Buddha once said, if we could see the world as he saw it, we would never take a bite of food before feeding everyone else—which is exactly what we do in oryoki. If we could see the world as the Buddha sees it, then loving-kindness, compassion, all these wonderful virtues would be spontaneously clear.

That’s the great heartbreak of the Bodhisattva, and perhaps of most religious traditions, is just the simple fact: it doesn’t have to be like this. We don’t have to actually do this. We don’t have to build successive and sophisticated realms of hell and inflict them on each other. We just really do not have to do that. And it’s really not that difficult. And yet we have to find a road that takes us home.

And so, road travelers, let us travel well. Thank you for listening.

37849,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-05-09 12:59","BA32","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Being One With: Fusatsu","","Fusatsu is the Japanese translation of Upavasatha, which is an ancient traditional practice started in the time of the Buddha, where the Sangha would come together twice a month. This still happens in some Sanghas, Theravada Sanghas, and a member of the Sangha would recite the precepts which the Buddha taught from the very beginning and which in his time were particularly important for lay students, as well as the monastic rules, the Vinaya, which are much more of a set of rules, much more extensive.

As the Precepts and the Vinaya are recited, members of the Sangha who have strayed from their vows have an opportunity to step forward, to speak about how they have strayed. In some cases they're given some act of penance. In many cases, just the act of speaking—bringing forth—is their repentance. This is a way for practitioners to bring themselves back into alignment with their vows, with how they are endeavoring to live their lives, back into accord with themselves.

Fusatsu is a practice, a way to bring ourselves back into alignment. We do stray, get caught up, confused. We return to acting out of habit, fear, desire. And we can use help remembering—remembering what is most true, what is important, remembering how it is that we want to live. What is the direction of our lives? What do we want the direction of our lives to be? What do we want to be cultivating, bringing forth, giving energy to?

We translate Fusatsu as a renewal of vows ceremony. And I've always wondered why the Precepts are not included in Fusatsu, these most important vows that some of us have taken formally. In my mind, I kind of consider them to be implied. Whenever we do the Gatha of Atonement, there's an opportunity to reflect. I take it as an opportunity to reflect on my practice, particularly of the Precepts—to reflect on how I have strayed, maybe how I have caused harm, hurt. How can I bring myself back into alignment with my vows? Often by doing differently next time.

Fusatsu is a practice of reflection and repentance. Fusatsu is sometimes translated as repentance ceremony. Repentance means recognizing where we've gone astray and includes a resolve to change, to act differently in the future. Fusatsu is a way to remember, to remind ourselves, to bring ourselves back into alignment with ourselves and to give verbal, physical expression to this.

Fusatsu is a way of remembering our vows, whether we have taken formal vows or not, and can help us to remember the importance of vows. Our vows can guide us, but we have to keep them alive, we have to take care of them, stay in contact with them.

So Fusatsu begins with this Gatha of Atonement. Daido Roshi used to talk about atonement as at-one-ment—when we turn towards, when we take responsibility, there is the potential for turning, karma resolving. And so we say, ""All evil karma ever committed by me since of old..."" And ""evil"" is a strong word; I get a little caught there sometimes. Other translations that might be helpful: unskillful actions, misdeeds, harmful actions, harmful karma.

We atone because we understand cause and effect. We understand that our actions do have effects, that we can cause harm, we can cause pain. We do, we have, on account of our beginningless greed, anger, and ignorance born of our body, mouth, and thought. The harmful karma we create is the result of our greed, our anger, our ignorance. It is from our actions, our speech, our thoughts that arise out of these confused states—a self-concerned state, a not-seeing state, maybe a not-paying-attention, not-caring state.

So the Gatha of Atonement is calling our attention to this as well. This is part of this teaching, practice, part of taking responsibility, part of our reflection. How do I create, what do I create, and what mind states do I create? And we atone.

Daido Roshi, in speaking about harmful karma, says when you take responsibility for it, you make it your own. And when you make it your own, then there is something that you can do about it. If you do not take responsibility for it, you are powerless to change. It is someone else's fault, something else is to blame, you are the victim. Taking responsibility empowers us to free ourselves of the endless cycle of cause and effect. This radical teaching of taking responsibility—it's what makes all transformation possible, what makes practice possible, what happens when we turn towards rather than turning away, when we look here, rather than turning outside, when we don't blame or put our discomfort outside, trusting there is a way here.

The Gatha of Atonement is a regular part of my personal liturgy. And sometimes there's something in particular that I want to take responsibility for, so that it can be resolved in me. And I say this: may this be resolved in me. And sometimes it's something that's mine, and sometimes it's something that's bigger than me, but I know runs through me. May this be resolved in me.

It is by taking responsibility that we can resolve. We can forgive, we can let go. And this part is important—the letting go, the forgiving, forgiving ourselves, forgiving others. Forgiving doesn't mean to condone harmful things that have been done. It's to not carry anger, resentment. And this practice of reflection, atonement—and atonement is not meant to lead us to shame or guilt, to beating ourselves up. These are not bringing us into accord. Returning to alignment.

Regret may be helpful. The pain of regret can be what tells us, brings our attention to what we've done. It's a sign that we care. Atonement, at-one-ment, is a practice to bring ourselves back into alignment, back into alignment with the direction that we choose for our lives.

We recite the names of the Buddhas—the past seven Buddhas, legendary Buddhas from the past eon, and from this fortunate eon. We live in the fortunate eon. As Roshi said earlier, we chant these names in our lineage, these enlightened beings, without beginning, going back eons. And then this human being, Shakyamuni, the Buddha of our time.

And we say ""Namu."" I've always understood ""Namu"" to mean ""being one with."" And it does. But it also means reverence, adoration, homage. And then we chant the names of the great bodhisattvas of this tradition, these beings who are manifestations of our own enlightened qualities. Namu, being one with Manjushri Bodhisattva, the embodiment of wisdom. Namu, homage to Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, embodiment of enlightened activity. Namu, adoration for Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, the great Compassionate One, your great, wise, compassionate heart. Maitreya is the Buddha to come, the next Buddha, the Buddha of the future. And there will be Buddhas, great teachers, enlightening beings after Maitreya, endless for eons to come.

Namu—being one with, turning towards, turning into. What does it mean to become one with? Namu, being one with these qualities that are our qualities, not outside of ourselves, that may come forth when we are clear in our mind, not confused, and that we may not be fully in touch with, that may be outside of our experience. How do we learn to trust that they are our qualities, our heart, our mind? These beautiful, wise, human qualities and aspirations are ours—to give homage to these qualities of being. Where are they?

We recite the Four Bodhisattva Vows. These vows that we recite frequently, every night here—reminders we can forget. We can stop hearing, chanting them so frequently, lose touch with what they are reminding us of. What is the direction of our lives?

Sentient beings are numberless. I vow to save them. Most simply, for me, this has always been a reminder that I'm not alone, this great truth that we are not alone. We all suffer and want to be free of suffering, want to be happy and at ease, and we are bound up together.

Related desires are inexhaustible. I vow to put an end to them, to lessen them, to not be controlled by them—by desire or by aversion. To not let desires dictate our actions, not let our fear and aversion drive the direction of our lives. A reminder—don't forget, this is where we can go astray, where we cause suffering. Desires themselves are not bad, but don't be confused. Don't get confused. Be wise, pay attention.

The Dharmas are boundless. I vow to master them. There is a practice, there is a path. We are offered these many ways to practice, these many places to enter. May I practice them, see for myself how they are a place to enter.

The Buddha Way is unattainable. I vow to attain. It's kind of our underlying vow, direction. There are five monastic vows, and the fifth is to accomplish the Buddha's way. And for me, that has always held the other vows, what is most important.

And we will end Fusatsu with taking refuge. Refuge in the three treasures. You'll see, we don't say that we're taking refuge, but that's my understanding of this part of the Fusatsu. Taking refuge means to rely upon completely, wholeheartedly. What do we rely upon? What do we put our faith in? What do we turn to when we need help? What do we turn to when we're acting out of habit, when we're not paying attention? What do we turn to when we're confused? What is it to take refuge in the Buddha, in the Dharma, in the Sangha? To turn towards consciously, wholeheartedly, and listen as we chant.

We say, being one with the Buddha. Being one with—again, Namu. Namu, reverence for the Buddha. Raise the mind of enlightenment. It is not outside, it is not elsewhere. Being one with the Dharma. Namu, reverence for the teachings; wisdom that is not apart from us. Being one with the Sangha. Namu, reverence for the Sangha; may harmony pervade. Namu, being one with—it is not outside. May we remember.

This is from the Book of Serenity, Four Sections of the Enlightenment Scripture.

A Pointer:

The presently forming public case is just based on the immediate present. The fundamental family style does not aim beyond the fundamental. If you forcibly set up divisions and foolishly expend effort, it’s all drawing eyebrows for chaos. Putting a handle on a bowl, how can you become peaceful?

The Main Case:

The Scripture of Perfect Enlightenment says: At all times, do not produce delusive thoughts. Also, don’t try to stop and annihilate deluded states of mind in realms of false conception. Don’t add knowledge and don’t find reality in no knowledge. 

Holmzhi: Magnificent, clearly outstanding, serene, at ease. Clamor pierces the head. Quiet is where to tread. Underfoot the thread breaks and I am free. The spot of mud on the nose is gone. You don’t have to chop, don’t budge on a thousand-year-old scrap of paper. Medicine is compounded.

So I wanted to speak a little bit this morning about the gate of Buddhist study. Gokanoshu gave a nice mondo on that earlier this week. 

As most of you know, Bodhidharma is attributed with having said that Zen is a special transmission outside the scriptures, with no reliance on words and letters, a direct pointing to the human mind and the realization of Buddha or Enlightenment. Daido Roshi, about that, says many people have interpreted this to mean that there should be no Buddhist study in Zen. But the principle of no dependence on words and letters should not be taken to mean abandoning the use of language, but rather to mean mastering its use. To not be a victim of it, to use it for what it is, to not try and use it for what it is not, to understand its realms of capacity, of influence, ability, power, we might say, and to recognize the limits of language. 

That’s why we’re sitting in a Dharma hall and not a classroom. The presently forming public case is just based on the immediate present. So the koan is translated as a public case. It is public in the sense that it’s open to all, it holds no secrets, and yet it is not immediately revealed because it’s speaking, you might say, to a part of our consciousness, a part of our mind, to the part of yourself which already knows, which is clear, without conflict, outside of scriptures—no reliance. Learning how to master the use of language rather than being a victim of it.

So when the pointer says, if we forcibly set up divisions and foolishly expend effort, it’s drawing eyebrows for chaos. So there’s chaos and somebody is drawing eyebrows, right? In the midst of chaos, to find one’s ground, what’s real. Daido Roshi used to say, if everybody around you is running and screaming, maybe there’s something you don’t know. That’s pointing to the other side. Sometimes if we impose a sense of calm, you know, we may not be noticing what’s happening around us.

Buddhism has much to say, certainly in the Zen tradition, pointing words, warning words, in a sense, cautionary words, around the use of language. Why? We can become so familiar with those teachings in Zen because we encounter them all the time and we see our own distracted thoughts. We might just sort of accept all of that on face value. So we can think of the realm of words and ideas, concepts, just in terms of basic distraction. When our mind is distracted, it’s distracted. Within language, we’re thinking.

But at a deeper level, there are concepts, beliefs, views. That’s why attachments are so hard to let go of. It’s not just an exercise of relaxing a muscle that is grasping. There is that kind of aspect of it. But what makes them so tenacious is the view underneath, the belief in them, the identity in them.

Bill Waldron, in his book on the Yogacara school, looked at this from the point of view of the early Yogacara teachings. He’s talking about Asanga, who is the originator of the Yogacara school, which is one of the principal schools of Mahayana Buddhism, bent Buddhist tradition, Zen tradition. This is around 4th century AD, very early. Asanga talked about the unconscious influence of language on our cognitive process—how we think, what we think, how we understand—and then explains that is owing to the special powers, this is Asanga’s words, of the predisposition or imprints of speech, that conscious awareness arises in regard to expressions of the self, of things, of our actions, that language has a special power, and within it there is a predisposition, right? An imprint that the speech is both arising from and is strengthening.

So it’s something that we are both creating and something that is, in a sense, turning back and reinforcing something within ourselves. He said cognitive awareness takes on the form of humans and gods, eyes and visible forms, comings and goings, due to the imprints of conventional expressions. In this way, he said, imprints from everyday speech, everyday language that we use every day, that imprint—that is, imprinting is influence, is changing. Our mind divides the world up into discrete objects and categories, subtly conditioning our conscious experience.

So think of just the noun, the use of the part of speech that is a noun. So something is a cup, a piece of paper, a person, right? It takes on the quality of being a thing, something that exists in and of itself, by itself. And so it’s a reification, a solidification, a kind of isolation of something unto itself. That noun conveys no sense of connection or interdependence, of mutual dependency. It just is. When we name it, then we know it, we identify it, and then we take those nouns and we put them into categories.

He said, the shape of the perceptions we experience, the categories of the things we see and touch, are subtly influenced by the expressions and figures of speech to which we habituate. So how we say things—the turning of a phrase, right? Think about phrases that are repeated over and over and over and over, right? This is just something that we do in our ordinary life. It’s also something that politicians have discovered: if they just keep saying the same thing over and over, it gets to the point where it doesn’t matter to some whether it’s true or not—it becomes true. It’s both coming from an imprinted mind, and its very purpose is to imprint the mind, to influence.

But then he goes on to say, languages, of course, are not private. They’re social and intersubjective. Their categories are shared among their respective speakers. So we think of language that brings us together. We can think of language that separates us and divides.

The Buddha was very clear about this—talked about divisive language, harsh language, numbing language. He called it idle speech, false language, just language, speech that’s not true. But language can also bring us together in hatred, right? In fear, in blame. It can also bring us together in kindness and compassion, in taking responsibility.

So as Daido Roshi said, it’s not a matter of not using it—it’s not misusing it, it’s mastering it, knowing what it is and using it well. And so then he goes on to say that Asanga talks about how this deepest level of our consciousness, the alaya, for those of you who understand, that includes both shared and individual aspects, and that this transition from individual to shared forms of unconscious cognitive processes is intriguing, but he says, be careful then we don’t think of that shared aspect as a kind of collective, right? Sometimes people say, is there like a collective mind, a collective consciousness? Buddhism does not teach that because the Buddha did not find that. Where is that? So a shared understanding or a shared language is shared, but it’s not a collective, as though it exists somewhere, as though it’s an entity.

And then he went on to say that this basic process of what he called a linguistification of human experience underlies the complex interrelationships among sensory forms of awareness, mental awareness of non-sensory objects such as thoughts or ideas, and the ensnaring web of conceptual proliferation. So just think about how when you think about something—maybe you read something in the news, or you’re just sitting here minding your own business on the cushion, and something arises and your mind recognizes it, grabs onto it and then proliferates, right? It starts having babies. Quickly it proliferates and that becomes, becomes. It’s coming from an imprint, it’s coming from our karmic mind, it’s coming from our view, it’s coming from the habits we’ve established. We’re not choosing the specific thoughts that we’re proliferating. They just seem to happen. And that is what can lend them a sense of, well, they must be true. That must be my intuition, or it must be the fact, or it must be what’s real. We don’t necessarily see that it’s just habitual—the ensnaring web of conceptual proliferation entangling us in webs upon webs of our own devising.

And that’s what we need to see, that our mind is actively involved, and that the habit nature of that is that it can do that seemingly without our participation, our willful participation. But that happens because the willfulness has already happened way early, where it was conscious, where we were making choices, where we were deciding about certain things.

And then he says, the most consequential of these recursive and self-referential processes has to be our ingrained sense of self, the conceit that I am, I am this, I am that. And of course, here he’s bringing forth the Buddha’s words. And so he says, in short, our sense of self-identity, which is so karmically potent, it is the seed of every form of suffering we see in the world. There can be no suffering without a self. There can be no creation of suffering in any form without a self, so to say. That it’s karmically potent is way understating matters. He says this is not just some simple referent of language. It is a byproduct of the recursivity entailed by language.

So, you know, he’s a scholar, so he’s speaking, you know, in kind of scholarly language, but trying to make it accessible to us and explaining, how does our mind work? Why are thoughts so proliferating? Why do we get so caught? Why are they so seductive—even when we may know that they’re false, still they grab us? Why are they so difficult to let go of even when we want to? And so Buddhism has been studying this for a long, long time. Why? To liberate ourselves. So, to liberate the self.

What Bill is basically saying is we can’t separate that from our language. It’s not just a matter of getting to a place where there’s no thought. The imprint is still there. The underlying views are still there. And that’s just a moment of calm or reprieve, right? Until the mind begins to move again, and then we’re caught again in that view.

And so this sutra, some scholars think that it originated in India—a Mahayana Sutra, clearly Mahayana Sutra. It was translated to Chinese. Other scholars think it might have originated in China around the 700s. It’s early, particularly influential in Asian Buddhism, in the Zen tradition, Chan tradition. And so in that it says: At all times, do not produce delusive thoughts. Okay, we get that. See the thought and let it go. And then it also goes on to say: Don’t try to stop and annihilate deluded states of mind. Hang on. What? In realms of false conception, don’t add knowledge, don’t add more, and don’t find reality in no knowledge. Don’t think that if I just free myself of any thought, of any view, that I am now liberated.

So then what are we to do? The Buddha was very clear about the caution around concepts. Anālayo Bhikkhu talks about this—when I have too many papers, you know, we’re in trouble. He says, in talking about the Satipatthana and talking about mindfulness, he says, concepts are intrinsically related to cognition. That’s very easy enough to understand, since the ability to recognize and understand relies on a subtle level of mental verbalization and thereby on the use of concepts in order to understand something. Right? That’s what the Skandhas are doing. They’re perceiving something, and then they’re placing it within a kind of order. Right? What is it? What kind of thing is it? What is it like? What does it do? Is it helpful? Is it hurtful? Is it good? Is it bad? Do I want it? Do I not want it? And that’s all, of course, involving language.

He said, according to the Buddhist survey of wrong views—views that are not skillful, not true—misinterpretations of reality can often be based on meditative experience, not just theoretical speculation. So he’s saying that if we just rely on meditation, right? I’m not interested in studying about the Dharma, I want to realize it, that our meditative experience itself can lead us in the wrong direction. Of course, we can also go in the wrong direction by just relying on ideas and concepts about Buddhism without meditating. They work together. Meditation grounds our study in actual experience, lived experience.

You read something, it may intrigue you, you may have faith in it, but is it true? Is it true? How do you know? Well, the Buddha said it was true. So if I say, well, that’s good enough for me—it may be good enough for me, but it’s not good enough for Buddhadharma. It’s not good enough if I want to liberate myself because it’s not my experience. And so the Buddha said, bring it into your experience. He actually said this. Listen to the teaching. Bring it into your experience. Find out. Verify.

So he says, to prevent such misinterpretations, a firm acquaintance with the teachings is an important factor for proper progress along the meditative path. For the Buddha, the mere absence of concepts does not constitute the final goal of meditation practice. If that was true, this talk could not be happening. We cannot receive the teachings. Concepts are not the problem, he says. The problem is how they are used. That’s what Daido Roshi was saying. A realized being still employs concepts, but without being bound by them. They use them knowingly, without being confused.

And he goes on to talk about how a purely theoretical approach to result in awakening, the Buddha said, is not possible because, again, it’s just living basically within our conceptual mind. It’s not in our actual embodied experience.

So think about, you know, in the Buddha’s time, where the only teachings that could happen, that could be found, were spoken—nothing was being written down. So you had to actually sit in the presence of the Buddha and listen, or you had to sit in the presence of one of his teachers, his disciples, and listen. Or you could have a conversation with another practitioner about the Dharma, but that was the only way it would happen. And then think about what we have now, right? Talk about proliferation. And of course, there are many good aspects to that, and there are other aspects that aren’t actually very helpful.

And so, to be a practitioner means to be discerning, right? Just like with anything, don’t just assume that everything that’s on the internet is true or reliable. What is true speech? The Buddha spoke in the Eightfold Path of right speech. It’s speech that is in accord with what is true, accord with Dharma, in a sense. It’s reliable speech. You can rely on it. You can trust it. But that’s based on what is true, what is being true. True to what? It always comes back to you. It comes back to the person, to the mind, the unfettered mind, the unconditioned mind, the unbiased mind, the mind that is brought forth and strengthened and clarified and cultivated, that is always there in completeness, but is clouded, veiled, shrouded.

And so Dharma practice helps us to not only disperse the clouds, but in that dispersal, we begin to make contact with a felt sense of something that is true.

So oftentimes, when we come together to practice, we hear the teachings, we practice together. We’re having a—I mean, just this morning, it’s like a banquet, a Dharma banquet of sounds and sights and smells and touches, right? That’s all happening together and is happening on your own seat in a way that only you can know.

I remember before I lived here, I was living about an hour away, and I was coming almost every Sunday, and I would leave and I would go home and just feel so filled, invigorated and inspired and just full. And I would think, how did that happen? You know, we did a service, we sat, I was trying to add up the parts, you know, this plus this, plus this. It didn’t add up. And I realized there’s something going on that is not the sum of the parts. It’s more than that. And that’s why practicing together, since the time of the Buddha, has always been so important. There is something that happens, something that touches us, that we are touching, that we feel.

And I spoke about this recently—that subtle sense of your own inner life, your own spiritual life, whatever you want to call it, whatever names you give to it, that aliveness, that desire for aliveness, that sense of what is true, that yearning for what is true—it’s so real. In moments, it seems tangible, and yet it can easily seem to go away, to become dim, to become distant, particularly when we become sort of caught up in our proliferating mind. And so I think of the Dharma as a spring that you have to keep going to drink from—just keep drinking from it, drinking from it.

The enlightenment scripture, the passage in which this comes from in the Perfect Enlightenment Scripture, says the Buddha is speaking to the Sangha, says, “O virtuous ones, all hindrances are themselves the nature of ultimate enlightenment.” Everything that we think is obstructing us, everything that we think is in the way—words and ideas, concepts, language—are ultimately our enlightened nature, are ultimately in and of themselves complete, are ultimately in and of themselves peaceful.

And so, in a very real sense, your distraction, your distractedness, if you practice it well, helps you build your mindfulness, strengthen your mindfulness. Your attachments, when you practice them, help you strengthen and cultivate and live more within non-attachment. Your lethargy, if you engage it—your dullness, your sleepiness—it’s a tough teacher, right? It’s a tough one, right? But it can teach you a tremendous amount about the energy, the natural flow of energy, the ki, the natural and always available alertness that exists within each of us. Your agitation can help you to discover a profound sense of relaxation. Your doubt can help you to discover the true nature of faith. Your expectations can help you to understand the difference between an expectation, which is very unhelpful and causes a lot of problems, but it can help us to understand that there’s that and aspiration—big difference. How anger, our anger, can help us to really understand the nature of compassion.

It’s not theoretical, right? We don’t practice in a test tube, right? These concepts are just concepts until they’re alive within us. Now, anger is not a word. I’ve talked about how I would sit there and my teacher would talk about, you know, going into the dragon’s cave, wrestling with the dragon—you know, stuff’s going to come up. He called it the bilge—you know, the stuff that’s… It’s like, you know, when your toilet backs up, you know, it’s like, ugh. And he says, but that’s how you become free—is by engaging it, understanding it, turning towards it. And I would think, yes, that’s what I am here for, that’s what I want. And when it was happening, that was not what I wanted. It was not what I came here for. It’s like I wanted what he was talking about, not this. And I actually thought that. I never thought, okay, this is what he was talking about. I didn’t think that. It took a while.

But if these obstructions can help us, then why aren’t we all being helped all the time? Because we have to learn how to practice them. There were lots of moments where I’d be in the middle of something and I would want to practice it. And I would think, I don’t know what that means. I don’t know what it means to practice this. And almost always when I reflect back, I was looking for something that was complicated. There was somewhere else I was looking for some sort of advanced, sophisticated teaching that I hadn’t received yet. I was just missing the simple reality of the moment—what is my mind? What is this? Do I even see it? What am I creating in my mind about this?

Master Dogen said, in a classical on reading a sutra, he said, “The practice and realization of unsurpassable complete enlightenment is brought forth sometimes by a teacher, sometimes by a teacher. A sutra, a teacher is a Buddha ancestor of the entire self. A sutra is a sutra of the entire self. We say this because you yourself are the self of all Buddha ancestors and the self of all sutras.”

So not only can we have insight by working with a teacher, but by entering into a sutra, teaching that the sutra is a sutra of the entire self. What does that—what is he pointing at?

When we do liturgy, when you’re chanting a sutra, to chant it with the whole body and mind—it’s language, those words have meaning. So part of it is understanding: What do these words mean? So that when you’re chanting it, the full experience of that sutra, that teaching, the words, the meaning, Buddhist meaning, the sound, your voice merging with the Sangha, all of that is present within you in a deep state of awareness, of alertness. And in that, something happens where you’re not just chanting words, where it’s not the Buddha’s words, it’s not you chanting something—the sutra becomes the entire self.

In the Prajna Paramita Sutra, there’s a section where Subhuti, who is a disciple of the Buddha, said that he was born after the image of the Buddha, right? What does that mean? And he goes on to say, “The Buddha’s suchness is Subhuti’s suchness. The Buddha’s enlightenment is my enlightenment. The Buddha’s mind is my mind.” Now step into Subhuti’s place: You are born in the image of the Buddha. The Buddha’s mind is your mind. The Buddha’s realization is your realization.

Dogen goes on to say, “Although it is called the self, it is not bound by you or I. Thus, there is a remembering, a chanting, a copying, a receiving and maintaining of a sutra. All of these are the practice realization of Buddha ancestors.” So he’s talking about traditional ways of studying sutras: chanting, remembering, memorizing, copying, receiving, maintaining—ultimately to be the sutra itself. That’s the essence of liturgy. To enter into it so wholly, so completely, that there’s a moment where those words are no longer the words of the Buddha—they’re your words, they’re expressing your experience.

Dogen said, “These mountains and rivers of the present are the actualization of the word, the sutra of all, of the ancient Buddhas, each abiding in its own dharma state.” Isn’t he saying the same thing? The mountain itself, Dogen is saying, is a sutra. It’s teaching. It’s teaching the dharma. It’s manifesting the dharma. How is that? To meet that dharma teaching, you have to enter into the mountain. You have to meet the mountain as the mountain. The mountain has to meet you as yourself.

Well, how can you do that if you’re here and the mountain is over there? If you are the self, if it is about you and I, if I am bound to that, I can look at the mountain. I could climb it, I could write a poem about it, but I can’t meet it. I can’t meet it in intimacy. I can’t meet myself. I can’t meet you.

Once, Master Yunju saw a student reading a sutra in her room, and he poked his head through the window and said, “What sutra is that that you’re reading?” And she said, “It’s the Vimalakirti Sutra.” And Yunju said, “I’m not asking you about the Vimalakirti Sutra. I’m asking, what sutra are you reading?” And at that, she gained insight. I’m not asking you about a book, about words on a page. I’m asking you, what is that sutra?

Everything in Dharma is coming down to this. To even say it’s personal is okay in the beginning, but it’s too limited. It too easily becomes just another form of being bound by you and I.

Master Yunmen said, “All the world is medicine. Where do you find yourself?” That’s such an important teaching in Buddhism. And, you know, it’s not just Buddhism. You know, just take whatever’s happening and, you know, find the good in it. Turn it into something positive. That’s good advice. But this is not that. You are already the sutra. You and the mountain are already indivisible. Your basic nature is the same. The nature between you and that person who really irritates you—same nature, same essence.

You know, when I read about how human beings—and I don’t know, lobsters or worms or, you know, some other creature, you know—have 97% of the same DNA, it’s like, what? How can that be? It’s kind of like that, except it’s 100%. The essence is 100% the same. Right? That’s what we call Buddha nature. That’s what we call our basic nature of emptiness. And the beauty of that is that it manifests in 100,000 million billion forms, which is the abundance of life.

But we just get confused and caught up and greedy and angry. There’s something that is not right within ourselves, and we don’t know what to do with it. We don’t know what to do with it. And so the easiest thing seems to be externalizing. Turn it out. Not me. It must be you. I was going to say it’s very childlike, but I want to—I don’t want to sell children short here. It’s unexamined. It’s unexamined.

And it, when it gains energy, when you give it power, it becomes dangerous. And I don’t mean metaphorically—literally. And the danger goes in all directions.

I’ve always thought it’s interesting that the more we grasp and cling to the self—because I don’t know what to do with what I’m experiencing here—and in my grasping, in my rejection, in my avoidance, in my lack of examination and in my externalizing of that, acting out of that, not only do I cause you infinite harm, but I’m killing myself and I don’t know it. And that’s the pickle of delusion, right? Is we can just keep accommodating and viewing and actually experiencing that destruction, self-destruction, as something that is good or positive or necessary.

Dogen said, “When intimate language encounters an intimate person, the Buddha eye sees the unseen. Intimate action is not known by the self, but the intimate self alone knows it.” And so, again, coming back to Buddhist study, you may be wondering, what is the connection here? Because we think of Buddhist study as study. It is studying the sutras, studying the teachings of ancient masters, past and present. It’s listening, hearing the Dharma, and then reflecting on it and then bringing it into our practice.

So it has many of the elements of study, of having learned how to study. What does this word mean? How to study in a contemplative way, in a way that is not just gaining knowledge, but is constantly being referenced back. I mean, even when I’m reading a scholarly work that is more historical or more about, you know, it’s not talking about meditation per se, you know, I find that important and valuable just for understanding how did we get here? But also, I’m always looking at it in terms of how does that relate to practice, how did that feed into the development of Buddhist teachings and practices and traditions over the centuries that have come down to here. I’m always interested in how can that be helpful, not just as another piece of knowledge, but in terms of lives, my life.

And of course, study sometimes gets a little too top-heavy, you know, so sometimes a person relies so much on study that they are intellectualizing their meditation practice. You know, they can’t let go of the concepts. And so students sometimes will come in and say, you know, I think I need to, like, have…take a fast, do a fast on study for a while, you know, or cut back a little bit. It’s like, okay, fine, you’re seeing something good. Respond to that, you know, maybe that will help you for now. You know, other people come in and say, I’m not—I don’t study. It’s difficult, it’s confusing. It’s because it’s talking about something complicated, like you. Right? We shouldn’t expect it to be just immediately accessible. It’s not like a Big Mac, you know, you have to chew on it, you have to work on it. I mean, for goodness sake, we’re willing to do that with our zazen. You know, if you expect this to be easy and you can’t let go of that, you’re not going to, that’s not going to happen. We’re willing to do that with zazen. It’s the same in a way. It’s more difficult because it is dealing with concepts—difficult concepts because the consciousness is deep. It’s profound. I mean, just language—just language. And so we should be patient and keep coming back, work at it, let it develop, see the connection, let it nourish your practice. Know the difference between intellectual, conceptual understanding and direct understanding. Know the difference. That’s part of our work.

Magnificent, clearly outstanding, serene, at ease. Clamor—he’s describing you, what this koan is pointing to. Not holding on to thoughts, not rejecting thoughts, not dwelling in conceptual ideas and thinking that that’s all there is, not abandoning concepts and ideas. What is the middle way, this most profound enlightenment of the Buddha? A middle way. It’s not balance. Balance is good, but that’s not what he’s talking about. Not dwelling in any extreme.

Clamor pierces the head. Quiet is where to tread. Underfoot, the thread breaks and I am free—cutting that thread that tethers us, binds us. The spot of mud on the nose is gone. You don’t have to chop—this points to… There were two people in the woods cutting, doing, cutting down trees for lumber. And one of them had a spot on his nose. And it was, here, I’ll take that off. And he swung the axe, took it right off. He says, no, you don’t have to do that. That mud, it’s not a problem. It’s not what you think. On a thousand-year-old scrap of paper, on a thousand-year-old scrap of paper, medicine is compounded. He’s talking about the sutra.

I’ll finish up with a few words from the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra. It’s a large text. When I handed this to Roxanne this morning, I said, it’s heavy Dharma this morning. He goes, it’s always heavy.

This is Subhuti speaking to the Buddha:

He says, “Deep, O Lord, is this perfection of wisdom. She is not to be developed by anyone, nor should anything be developed, nor should one develop anywhere. Why? Because in this deep perfection of wisdom, one does not get at the full reality of the Dharma. You can’t get to it. It’s not a place you cannot get to, which would develop or which would you develop or through which you would develop. Rather, a development of space is this development of the perfection of wisdom.”

How do you develop space? You can’t touch it, you can’t grasp it. It’s like that.

He says, “A development of the Dharma is a development of what is not, a development of not taking hold, a development which is really an undevelopment. That is this development of the perfection of wisdom.”

It’s actually a very good description of zazen. Ultimately, with all of the effort that you bring, you are bringing yourself to a state of not developing, not creating, not proliferating, not doing. If enlightenment could be something that you could create, you could find, you could get to, we’d all be there. We’re good at that. That’s why we have to employ extraordinary measures, which are also very, very ordinary. It’s just your mind. It’s your natural mind.

When the Buddha was dying, his last words were, “Take heed, be heedful, apply yourself.” And so, those of you who have joined us for the weekend, I really hope that this was helpful to you in some way, to bring some energy into your seeking, into your practice. If you have a practice, if you want to develop a practice, I hope you have some sense of how to do that. You know how to get here now. We have a seat for you whenever you want to come. But whatever it is that brought you here, that fire, that ember, take care of that. 

From “thus have I heard” to “be ever heedful,” the sutras have always been intimate words for the intimate person to see the unseen. May we bring that to fruit in our own lives. The world is counting on this.

Thank you for listening.

So let's just start by sitting for a moment and kind of centering in, getting in touch with why we're here. And I'd like to just offer a little bit around that, so as you settle yourself—and those of you at home also—to just recognize this really precious opportunity to be together as Sangha, to have encountered the Dharma and have conditions in which we can practice and realize the Dharma, and to feel into our own aspiration in a personal and real way, to know for ourselves our true connection, our true connection to each other, to this earth, to this cosmos, to all the creatures and beings. 

An aspiration to not only know for ourselves this true connection, but that everyone—that everyone—might know this true connection, and an aspiration to live in accord and out of this recognition, and that everyone might live in accord with this recognition. One great body, releasing our clinging and grasping, moving beyond our self-centered inclinations, expanding beyond our own suffering and touching the true abundance of reality. So let's take up this time together tonight in that spirit. Thank you.

So this mondo is on the teacher-student relationship. And before I get into it, actually, let me just mention for those who may not be aware: there's a program that SHAC is offering on Saturday morning that I think is such a valuable offering. It's an online program, so those of us here at the monastery won't be participating unless—maybe unless you decide to ask if you can participate. But it's called Engaged Response Part One, Holding the Fire. And so it's really coming out of: How do we use our practice at this particular time to meet the moment in the burning world? And they've put a lot of thought and effort into thinking about how to frame an experience that would be meaningful for folks and supportive and helpful. And it is. It'll start with some words from Shugen Roshi, who will kind of lay a nice dharma foundation. And then people will have a chance to speak together in breakout groups. There's some pre-work, so if you're going to go, you need to do a little homework. So check out the website. I think Kian's going to put the link in the chat, and I hope that if it's something that you're needing right now, you'll be able to join them for that.

Okay, so the teacher-student relationship. Our theme this ango: on the eight gates and training in the eight gates, this is the gate we're going to take up tonight. I was talking with someone earlier this week, and they sort of wondered aloud if maybe I had been assigned this topic. And I chose—I chose it. I chose this topic. I thought it would be helpful for me, and hopefully helpful for you too.

Just to state what I think is obvious to most, if not everyone: I have a lot more experience as a student, and I'm just beginning to have some sense of what it means to teach. And not being in the role of a transmitted teacher yet in that way or having students, I'm really going to be leaning on my experience as a student. And it turns out as I do begin to do a little bit of teaching, that that is totally the experience that I am always drawing upon.

So I was thinking about how this gate is like, I think, maybe the edgiest gate. And I was thinking about practicing the edge. When I think about that phrase, which is a phrase that Daido Roshi used to invoke a lot—practice your edge—it's like, oh, what is that edge? And I was imagining walking along a cliff edge at sunset, and it's craggy, and there's waves breaking beneath, and there's gorgeous, gorgeous land all around. And how it's so powerful and so beautiful and so full of possibility, and then also not without its peril.

So I wanted to start—I thought we should go to the heart of the matter. And I wanted to do just a very brief five-minute, two-and-a-half-minutes-each, pair share. The question that I would like to ask you, at least to get started with—you won't plumb the depths of it—typically when we think about showing up in front of a teacher, we know what we're there to learn. If I'm going to a French cooking class, I know I'm there to learn French cooking. If I'm going to a foreign language class, I know I'm there to learn Spanish or Japanese or whatever it may be.

When you show up in front of a Dharma teacher, what is it that you are there to learn in your own words? No wrong answers. Please, amongst yourselves, find a partner, and just briefly, how would you say it? Try not to rely on Buddhist jargon, but just authenticity, authentic and fresh. What are you there to learn? And folks at home, we're going to put you very briefly also in a pair with someone, so stay tuned.

So I would love to hear what it is you think you're going to learn. Or, said another way—yeah, why? Why study with a teacher? And folks at home, if you would like to put a few words or a phrase into chat from your pair share, it would be nice to have some of those in circulation too for the folks who are on Zoom. But here in the room, what came up for people?

Thank you, Blue. It's a wonderful quality. There you go. Oh, geez. Thank you.

So I guess I question the question, like, what are you going to learn? Since SJ and I were thinking, when we meet a teacher, we aren't learning, okay. But I, like, you're like this—some lengths to, like, work with a teacher. So if it doesn't fall into the framework of learn for you, like what? Like why? You're right. It is about relationship. It's a going—I didn't talk to SJ about this, but it seems to be it's about going deeper than psychology and therapy and just talk.

It is, yeah. Like SJ was saying, it's sort of a mirror—encountering a mirror of who you are at that moment.

Okay. Okay. Going deeper. Good. A mirror of who you are. All right. All right. What else we got? Shoka.

Hello. Hello. We didn't actually talk about this, but when you posed the question that you just posed, I was immediately—came to mind—Hogan's encounter. And this idea of deceiving yourself. And so a big part of why I work with a teacher is to understand how I might be deceiving myself, how not to deceive myself, how not to deceive others.

Okay. And why is that important? And in what way do you mean deceive?

It's something about honesty and something about reality. Interpreting reality in a genuine way, not seeing what a person wants to see, what I want to see. I don't know. Not making up stories. Huh? Like seeing reality as it is.

Yeah. Yes. That's a better way to say that.

Thank you. Joe Shen.

So when I approached the idea of having a teacher, I was already interested in the Dharma and living my life according to the Dharma. But it felt like a very big, complicated endeavor. And so I wanted a teacher to show me that I was on the path and that I'm living a life according to the Dharma.

And when you were starting out and you had maybe just a little sense of what the Dharma might mean or what that word or phrase pointed to, like, what was it that you were looking for? Or what was it that you found in the Dharma that you wanted more of? Just in your own words. All I'm trying to do is try and get you to say the same thing without using the word Dharma. Like, what does that mean to you?

Okay. Yeah. So then maybe I'll borrow a little bit from Shoka. I felt, yeah, that I was not seeing all of my life clearly, that I was—I'm just going to put it in terms of my own life—that I was buffeted by the winds of whatever was occurring, that my mood would change according to those things. And that when I was in the presence of my teacher, hearing his words began to ground me. And it began to feel like I was getting in touch with a part of myself that I hadn't been aware of before, but was very—something very true about it. And he was helping me find a path in that touched the part of me that was very true, and yet I hadn't had the words for it, but I wanted more of it.

Beautiful. Thank you.

Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? For you, I see in my teacher an example of how to live the Dharma. I see that manifested, and that enlarges for me the possibilities of what I could do myself, what kind of life I could live. So that's been very important to me.

Can I ask you the same thing? Push you in the same way that I did with Joshen. And so when you say you see your teacher living the Dharma, and it opens up possibilities for how you could live, can you say, without using the word dharma, like, what is this living that you're seeing that you wish to embody yourself?

Compassion. It's enlarged what I can see as possible—to live a life of compassion. It was much smaller before. Now it's larger. I don't think I would believe it if I didn't see it manifested in people.

Great. Thank you. Yeah.

Kian, did anything go into the chat at home?

A lot of responses. You just give us a taste.

Practice of intimacy, guidance. How to practice what I'm stuck on. Trust to better understand my mind, how to work with my mind, to identify if I'm reasoning or practicing.

Okay. Okay. Thank you. Great.

Thank you. And in a way, like in a different circumstance, I would love to take the entire evening and really hear from each person. I feel it's very, very rich. And I always feel nourished by touching that heart, you know, and hearing it in someone else. So thank you.

So I wanted to start this way because how we show up in front of the teacher, I mean, is, like, going to affect what we're able to receive. And I think what we heard in the folks who were willing to share is that the thing that we're looking for, the learning that we want, is not an ordinary kind of learning, right? It's not information, it's not knowledge-based. It's not really even skill-based. I mean, people didn't go to that so much actually, in terms of like how to meditate or something like this. But that depth, that mirroring of our being, the true part of our nature, that vast, boundless heart—what we're talking about, in a sense, is learning how to transform consciousness, our consciousness.

And when we talk about the role of the teacher in Buddhist tradition and the role of the student, we talk about this transmission—mind to mind transmission. Daido Roshi would always say, ""Nothing goes from A to B."" And so again, the scenario is that we actually—we already have the Buddha mind. And so we're not getting and we're not learning and we're not taking something from outside and putting it here. And yet something does need to shift. There is some kind of learning, but what is it? What's its nature? How does it work?

And also helpful, I think, to recognize this because on the road, right, in a relationship, we're going to bring so much of our karmic relational baggage into the picture. And so if we can be clear, like, okay, why am I in this relationship? Or why am I exploring this relationship and see that clearly, then when we get blindsided by all the other stuff that's going to come up along the way—such as wanting approval, seeking love, seeking someone to make our problems better, actually looking for therapy, healing our karma, or just plain old advice on how to live, what should I do? So we may have moments of that. There's nothing wrong with that. That's part of a natural Dharma path. But to be clear for ourselves, like, that's not the heart of the matter. And our teacher, our Zen teacher, may actually not be the best person to fulfill that need or that want for us in our life.

Transformation of consciousness. If we're talking about the deluded consciousness, right, where we have this mistaken sense of ourself, where we believe our thoughts for reality, we look through our views and we think that we're just seeing the world. We don't recognize our view for our view. Our judgments and opinions appear to us to just be reflections of what is. So it's extremely difficult to see through this delusion on our own, and yet we're extremely attached to it. And if we're inviting someone into our life and actually seeking out and asking them, help me disrupt this delusion, then we should be prepared for it to be uncomfortable.

And so this is why I'm saying the teacher-student relationship is so edgy, because we're coming at it from, like, you know, a full heart, like really, you know, for the most part, I think, pure, good intention. And then we're going to end up meeting disruption, the upending of our sense of self to some degree, the chipping away of things that we've put in place to protect us.

And so how does this actually unfold? You know, this piece about just recognizing conceptual mind, I feel like that has been such a—in my relationship with Shugen Roshi—that having him, like, again and again and again over years be like, ""That's an idea, that's a concept, that's an idea, that's a concept."" And, and, like, how much it takes to really start to see the depth, at least for me, to see the depth of that conditioned karmic mind for what it is.

So as we go a little bit further, I wanted to kind of think in terms of two aspects to several different pieces of the student-teacher relationship. So I wanted to talk a little bit about upaya. What's the skillful means? If this is the project—I mean, that's such a horrible way of putting it—if this is the aspiration, if this is what we're endeavoring, is this kind of awakening of our Buddha mind, our unconditioned natural mind, then how?

So within a tradition, that's one of the beautiful things about being in a lineage and in a tradition: there's upaya, there's skillful means, there's ways of working that have been handed down. So I wanted to talk about that a little bit. I wanted to talk about within that the role of the teacher and the student. Why is that a thing? To talk a little bit about Dokusan and face-to-face teaching and training in that way, and to talk about commitment and the importance of commitment and a relationship that takes place over time.

And with each of these things, what I want us to do is to look at: How is it upaya? How is it skillful means? And what's the shadow side of that? What's the edgy piece? Where's the peril?

Okay, so this will be made much richer and much more beneficial to all of us gathered if you are willing to participate and make yourself vulnerable in terms of being authentic. That's what I mean by vulnerable: in terms of just being real. Because we've all studied, whether we're formal students, and some of us have been training as students for many years, or whether we're here at this monastery for a period of time and in that way have shown up as a student or are exploring that process, we can all speak from our own experience. So everyone knows or can know our own experience. And in that way, we have something to offer.

Okay, so before I go on, I want to shift in a moment and talk about the role of the teacher and the role of the student. But just before I go on, any questions at this point? Or, I don't know, anything that's emerging? I shall proceed.

Okay. All right. So in Zen, we do talk about the three trainings, right? The precepts—sila, meditation—samadhi, concentration, and prajna—wisdom. And so the teacher-student relationship is kind of holding all of those, right? As students, we do so much just on our own. We do so much with each other in Sangha. And then there's this other piece that's the teacher—the teacher-student piece.

And so this notion of having a teacher, it goes way back, right? And within Buddhism, it's interesting to note that the Buddha himself—I was speaking with Gokan as I was getting ready for this, and he brought up—I can't exactly remember the question that I asked, but he brought up, there's a sutra where it's after the Buddha's enlightenment, and he's decided, okay, he will teach the Dharma. And he's thought through in his mind, like, who would he teach? And he thinks of his two teachers that really were so important for him. And he learns that each of them has died, a couple of those recent teachers. And so he realizes, like, oh, well, he could teach the group of mendicants that he was training with. And so he goes back to see them, and when they see him and greet him by saying ""friend"" and using his clan name. And he says, ""Do not call me friend and do not use my clan name."" And it's kind of this, like, startling moment where it's like, what's up with this guy? And it's also upaya. Something's happening there, right? Something's happening there, as he sort of says, like, wait, no, it's not like that. I'm no longer—I'm no longer best identified by those words. And I'm no longer—if you think of me as your friend, then I'm not fulfilling the role that I came here to fulfill. I mean, that's my sort of attempt to interpret that response.

So we have that. And then within Zen, there's also this way that, like, the Zen teacher—like, we really appreciate and recognize the Zen teacher as, like, an ordinary person. And there's a lot of the way that the forms of Zen reinforce that, right? Shugen Roshi has meals with us, and Hojun Sensei and Hogan Sensei too. They eat with the Sangha. They sit in the zendo with the Sangha. They're there at the caretaking meeting. And they get an assignment too, from the work supervisor. So on the one hand, it's like, okay, well, they're ordinary beings. I don't think that we're confused about thinking that there's something other than a human being. And if we are confused about that, if we're paying attention, sooner or later we're going to see like, oh, they're just people.

And at the same time, well, when they sit in the zendo with us, they sit at the front of the zendo. Right. They definitely have special seats. When they get a work assignment, it's not exactly cleaning the bathrooms, right? Abbot's duties or teachers' duties. And, and, and you know, when they're eating with us, we are pretty informal about that. But, like, you know, the gisha comes and takes their dishes away, and maybe if you're talking to them, they'll take your dishes too. So it's, it's pretty low-key, but there's a—there's a gesture there. There's a gesture.

And so there is this aspect of we're empowering the teacher. They get a little something special. So how is that upaya and how is that edgy? I want to hear from you.

Thanks, Visay. Well, I suppose if you were a teacher and you also had to occupy the role of friend, you might be reluctant to say something that your student friend wouldn't want to hear. Might be actually harder. I think it would definitely be harder to offer what was needed if you were—yeah—close in that way.

So that's the totally—the skill, the edge is that sometimes, for me anyway, it has been that when Shugen Roshi is playing the long game with me, as it were, and being skillful, it can feel not great. And it took—I mean, just speaking from current circumstances, it took me maybe years actually to see that some of the things that felt really crappy at the time were like, oh, now, now it's actually—I see. But, but at the time it was like, yeah, like being on the edge of a, you know, a can that had been opened badly, like a, you know, rough and sharp and not fun.

Yeah, yeah. And so that—that in order to stay in there, right, during this period of time where it's rough and sharp and not fun, like what—what have you needed to bring forward as a student?

Trust, perseverance, capacity to be uncomfortable, yeah, and a little bit of wisdom to know when it's like, when I need to seek help elsewhere, which is also thankfully possible.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so rich, right? Along the journey of, like, working with the teacher to transform our mind, to wake up, we're gonna move through—it's not like the transformation is like—it's not like this, just see it this way. It's like you're going through all of that, right? Like that having to trust yourself and trust the teacher and persevere in the long haul—that is your consciousness transforming.

Meiju, so the edge for me, one of the edges has, I think, always been, like, this question of, is it actually upaya? I remember with Daido, a lot, like, he would express his anger or irritation, and Jeffrey and I would, like—it was like an ongoing debate. It was like, he'd be like, that was skillful means. And I'd be like, no, he lost his temper. And I think I've also had experiences where I felt some of the things and ways that I have learned the most, like, from Shugen, I'm not sure actually where skillful means—I feel like my, you know, like, I worked with them. So that's one part of the edge.

And I think the other part of the edge is just for me and my personality and my karma and my relational karma is just that piece of trust. And knowing that actually there is a lot of skillfulness. And sometimes I can see in the moment that that's what's happening. Sometimes, like Fuyu was saying, I can see later. But yeah, that piece of trusting myself too, and sometimes not being sure which is which. Yeah. But knowing that I can learn something anyway, I feel like that is so, like, what makes that possible—the sort of, like, is it upaya? Is it not? Did someone just, like, you know, do that intentionally? Or are they just acting, you know, in a way that's unskillful and then but you somehow using it—what makes that possible?

I mean, I think that that is, you know, kind of goes back to your first question of, like, why am I here? What do I want? What's most important to me, like, who do I—it—like, I want to be somebody who makes use of whatever this is.

It's so real. It's so real. It's like those moments that feel like, wait, this is not supposed to happen. Like, this is—like, this is not how it's supposed to go. It's like knowing why you're there and using that is so potent. Again, like, that's the transformation. Thank you. Yeah.

Kyosha, right behind you.

I feel like one of the vulnerabilities is this kind of, as a student, putting oneself in harm's way with a teacher. Not so much that the teacher's intention is somehow to cause injury, but that one is not in control of what that is going to happen once one gets over what I see as this kind of comradely skepticism, where we don't see the teacher as anything different than ourselves and are kind of skeptical that they even have anything worth bothering about—like, why we should get ourselves into a place of thinking, or are we just groveling and acting out a role and all these things that eventually come to a place of, well, I need something anyway. Does this person—and then can I reach out? And I don't know what I'll find.

And I think what you're pointing to is something I've thought about too, which is like, if we empower them in the role of teacher, then something becomes possible that's not possible if they're just our friend.

Yes.

Right. I mean, I remember being in the kitchen as the cook many moons ago, and Shugen doing caretaking in the kitchen. And he at that time had teaching responsibilities. And I was like, okay, I'm gonna watch how this guy cuts onions, because maybe there's like, you know, maybe there's something I'll see there that will show me what this is, like, he's got it. Okay. He just seems like an ordinary person. Like, let me study. And that—like, what that did for me, you know. And, you know, spoiler alert, he just cut the onions mindfully. Mindfully. I did observe that.

And also, going back to what Fuyu was saying in the beginning, if we empower the teacher, then they can be a model. Then, as Meiju was alluding to, the edge of that is like, what if they're not modeling well? Really important all the way along the student-teacher journey is we are the owners of our own power. There's actually no part of this teacher-student relationship in which we should be giving our power away. We're being introduced to it. We're being guided in how to discover and refine it. But we should feel empowered as a being all the way along.

And sometimes we may not. We're looking for something, we want a certain experience, we're not getting the approval we want, we're not getting the kind of contact we want—whatever it is, it's unsatisfying. But we should study those moments and see, like, are we giving our power away? Are we thinking that someone else is going to make us feel better? Because that's the edgy part.

There's a great article that I wanted to just allude to in this place. And it has to do with—it's an article called ""Student and a Zen Perspective."" And some of you may have seen it. It's by Nikoli Jikyo Roshi, who is a Dharma heir to Maezumi Roshi, later than Daido Roshi. She received transmission from him in 1995. But this article, and I asked Kian to put the link in the chat for folks at home, it's, I think, really excellent. She's basically trying to illuminate for people, here's some of the common pitfalls. And she uses the language of therapy to talk about transference and countertransference. I think it's a fairly straightforward, fairly brief, condensed piece of writing. And if you're a Zen student, you'll totally relate to it. So I think it's worth looking at.

But she talks about—she names some unrealistic expectations that we might have for a teacher. And I just thought that they were so good, I wanted to share them: wanting to be understood and supported all the time, wanting the teacher to be omniscient. I remember saying this actually in a mondo years ago. I was like, wait, I thought you would know how I felt. No, we have to say. Wanting the teacher to fix you and wanting to be special most of the time. So relatable. So relatable.

So one more shadow piece from when we empower a teacher and put the teacher in the teacher's seat, kind of raise them up in that way, is that they get confused and they think they're more powerful or that they are outside the rules. And we have seen this happen, certainly in the Western Dharma and also in our Sangha, and the harm that that causes. So important to name that, that piece, that edgy piece, too.

All right, so we've put the teacher in the teacher's role. We've sort of empowered them. There they are. And now training, training, face-to-face teaching: this kind of hallmark of the Zen school goes way back—the private meeting with the teacher. Certainly these kinds of teacher-student, one-on-one encounters are so kind of held up in the koan tradition. Dogen writes about it in his writing. And even outside the Zen tradition, meditative traditions often will emphasize this one-on-one relationship and opportunity to meet with the teacher.

So I think, you know, to some degree, I think probably all of us have experienced face-to-face teaching in some form. And some, to some degree, I think it's kind of obvious why this is upaya. We're working with our own conditioning, and so being met just as an individual with whatever's arising for us can be really skillful. And, you know, that's part of why we don't talk about face-to-face teaching, that the general guideline is you don't talk about it outside of face-to-face teaching because it was offered for you, coming from your position with your energetic experience that you brought forward. And when you repeat it to your friend, what gets lost there? What sort of leaks out or could be misunderstood? Or how do we make a story out of a live moment, a live encounter?

And at the same time, important to say that it's not, that it's secret, right? And for sure, one of the lessons from power breaches that I think we're learning more and more is the difference between private and secret, right? It's not secret.

So the tricky part of dokusan or face-to-face teaching is that we have to show up, and we have to show up in a real enough way that we can be met and really worked with. And that can be hard for various reasons. But the teacher has to get to know the student, and, you know, a teacher-student relationship can really develop and deepen over time over all of those opportunities.

So that sense, I think a lot of us probably have worked with, of wanting to like put your best face forward, you know, to show up and sort of, like, be thought well of, be taken seriously, you know, say something intelligent. Like, we kind of got to get through that point until we're willing to really look like an idiot and just be completely with whatever is coming up. But willing—Daido Roshi used to say, ""You've got to be willing to show your pimples."" What does think of that?

So with dokusan, what's the upaya and what's the edge, what's the shadow? And think of your own, you know, your own experience. I'm saying dokusan, but I mean, you know, face-to-face teaching.

Yeah, Olivia, great.

I think some of the edge can come a little bit from our expectations laid by our culture. We have teachers when we're kids, we have teachers in various forms throughout our lives—very different, obviously, than a Dharma teacher. But dokusan sometimes can feel like a test, and you can get that contraction of, you know, you wanna, you wanna prove something or you wanna be something rather than being genuine. So I think that can be something. We can get stuck in that baggage of what is a teacher and what are our past experiences with our teachers, and how do we bring that into the room and then push past it to have something that's more genuine.

Totally. Thank you.

And sometimes—go ahead, Kokuan, and I'll hold my thought.

No, it's good. Thanks, Olivia. I was just thinking, the first time I had dokusan with Daido Roshi, I was here for the Zen training weekend many years ago and Gikon, you know, said, ""Many of you are here to find a teacher."" And I remember thinking, I'm not here to find a teacher, because I was thinking guru, you know, and talked about the whole experience of face-to-face teachings and said to go in with your question. What is your question? And I was saying, I don't have a question, you know, but I have to go in with something, what am I going to do? And luckily I was like one of the last people to go in, so it took a long time. So I sat, I'm like, what am I going to do? You know, I realized I did have a question. By the time I got to the point where I went in the room, I had a question, I just didn't know it. And so I had a lot of resistance to that part of the eight gates, you know, but it turned out to be the most powerful part of the entire weekend for me. And if you read the transcript, it wouldn't—you wouldn't think it was anything, you know, that earth shattering. But for me it was. And ever since then, really just the whole process of dokusan with, you know, Daido Roshi and Shugen Roshi, I get, it's almost like—I don't know if nervous is right, but it's, something happens that is like, there's like an anticipation. This is important. And I feel this every single time in varying degrees, not always the same level intensity. But for me it always feels like a special opportunity. And when I go in, my heart's beating a little faster. Don't know why exactly, but it's almost always like that in various ways.

Thank you. Yeah. There's a lot in what you said, and one thing I'd love to just tease out is the form, you know. So I know in some sanghas, dokusan—there isn't dokusan like we do it, and there's like a practice conversation, and you, you know, go to the teacher's quarters and you have tea, and you can imagine, like, that would have a whole other feeling and would have—probably would bring some really rich benefits, you know, that kind of interaction. And then there's the, you know, your heart's beating and you're sweating it on the do. There's the way that that is skillful means, to bring—I mean, I also appreciated what you said about, like, if you read a transcript, it's like, there's so much that's happening that's about energy that's beyond words, right? That's about presence and your own being and feeling another person. And, you know, now that we have the online version, I always worry, like, oh, like, there's nothing like being there actually face to face.

Yeah. Tensei, and then Kian.

So there's something about the formal bowing at the door and presenting yourself that allows it to not be a conversation. And sometimes, so it always feels like before I go in, the trick is trying to figure out what is here that I need to, like, bring up. And when I'm able to, you know, sort of really figure out what it is that, you know, like, I'm feeling or what it is that is there, and I can bring it into the room, it feels like I am better met. And I don't know. And there's something about the ritual of it that just brings it to a different state. So that—yeah. So, I mean, there are times when you can walk into the—you know, you walk in there, and then there's, like, the words that get exchanged, and then there's all this stuff that has nothing to do with the words, and the ritual is what somehow allows that to, I don't know, transpire, to be felt and exchanged.

Yeah. Thank you. You and Kokuan are both touching on something that I wanted to get into first. Kian, and then I'll turn that corner.

Yeah. Well, this is from Chiko Online. The edges with myself, they're just a mirror. It's my mind that's going—of emotional gymnastics. They're there, being present and compassionate to my growing up.

Thank you, Chiko. Yeah. And that feels like it also connects with what I wanted to pick up from Tensei and from Kokuan, which is this, like, how to use face-to-face teaching. Is there, like, a bug on me? I kept feeling it. Is it still there? I started to be like, am I hallucinating, you know? And I didn't want to, like, continue to paw at the side of my neck. I can see how it would be awkward. Like, do you say something? So we're good? We're good. If you see it again, though, will you please say something? Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. All right. Well, if I know where it is, it's okay.

How do you use Dokusan? And what do you do when you feel like you have nothing to say? I love to hear from folks. We already did somewhat. Yeah. Ash and then Miro.

Okay, I would say that that's the white microphone. Yeah. I would say often there is—there is no plan when I walk into Dokusan. It's just what is live at the moment. So it's not like I have to actively like, oh my God, what exactly am I going to say? Maybe there's kind of—I know because I live in my body what is happening and what is important, and I don't have to think about, okay, is that the right thing to talk about? If it's there now, then it is, I suppose. And sometimes maybe you're not in touch with that and kind of—it can be daunting as your moment is approaching and you're like, I don't know what to say, but it's worked out so far.

Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It's like we hear so much about practice being, connecting with ourselves as we are in the moment. Like, why wouldn't it be the same for face-to-face?

Yeah, I was pretty much just gonna say the same thing, so.

Okay, okay. Anyone else on that?

Yeah, Baike.

I feel like when I'm a little more in it, this image keeps coming back to me, which is like, how much can I cut my heart out of my chest and put it at my teacher's feet? And like, just how much of myself can I present? And that's like the—for whatever reason, that image has stayed with me for a very long time.

That's potent. Yeah, thank you. Very vivid.

I remember once a friend in the Sangha saying, yeah, like, figuring out how to form a question is like part of the practice. That's like, you know, and we sort of train in that too over time. So how do I get in touch with my experience and then how do I take that experience and sort of bring it, bring it forward, you know? And then of course, like, not every face-to-face teaching feels like, you know, a meeting of the minds or like a true moment or like a winner. Like, I feel like, you know, how many times has it been like my last dokusan of sesshin? And I'm like, okay, this is the last one, really make it count. And then I go in there and I'm like, is it him or is it me? But this is like, really? We're not—maybe he's tired, maybe I'm tired, I don't—I'll be like, that was so lame, you know. Going back to my seat and just being like, God, what—I wasted it, you know, it's on me.

Thank you. Like ten people told me it just went, like, inside your—thank you. Thank you. Who are you, little creature?

So here's the other thing about a relationship that takes place over time. Like, that's fine, right? Not every conversation with your friend or your parent is like a deep heart-to-heart conversation. So we can have, like, textured experience. Sometimes it's a little meh, like, okay, good to know. No big deal. No big deal. And that actually we never really know. You know, there's sometimes we're in face-to-face teaching, it feels very significant, you know, an exchange feels very significant. And then there's the times where it doesn't feel significant. And yet something has happened. Something has happened in some way. We're on a journey, right? It's going to unfold over time.

When I was making my notes—I do like a kind of a—I have my own system, but I have like a rough draft. And as I was going through the rough draft, I saw that I had written that phrase, ""a relationship that unfolds over time,"" three different times. Yeah. So I kept coming back to that and feeling like that's significant.

Anyone else on face-to-face and how to use it? Yeah, the white.

I resonated with what Baike was saying, and that's something I do sometimes. But maybe I don't emphasize, I don't prioritize making a question or, like, coming up with a question. Like, I'm kind of lazy on that. I've just noticed that maybe I kind of dismiss it. I don't have a question, but I can always just say what I'm going through. Or, like, I can kind of try to give my teacher a picture of my mind or my heart. And maybe not—yeah, like, is that—I think I tend to make my own rules, sort of like, it's like, okay, I don't need to make it a question. I can just say what I am. Or like, you know, but is there—yeah. Is it still important, I guess, to practice that question, making it a question or like—yeah, I don't know. I mean, that's one thing. But yeah, I resonate with what Baike was saying.

I appreciate what you're saying. And I don't have a clear, like, stance on that. In some ways, I think if we're open, like, if you're—if we're kind of—if we're coming in and saying what's on our mind and heart and we're doing it in a way that's, like, listening or that's—a question comes up.

Yeah, actually, that does happen. Yeah, it just comes up naturally.

Like, it comes up naturally or, like, we're, you know, saying all of the things around the question and the teacher maybe is listening and can see the question there. So I think that's fine. You know, sometimes I feel like people, particularly in the beginning, get a little fixated on, like, the question, and then it becomes like, you know, ""My question is..."" and because of the pressure of feeling that you have to ask a question, you're not actually touching the heart of what's live for you. So I would say better to err on the side of being in true contact. And I also think that when we can ask a question that's a pointed, framed question, we get that kind of response, right? Like in all of those koans, the student isn't like, ""Oh, I was feeling this kind of weird, queasy feeling."" They have a question, right? ""Why did Bodhidharma come from the West?"" So then we get that kind of response. And that can be very helpful.

I was just thinking, a question comes up after the dokusan, as it ends. And then, yes, next time I'll ask.

Yeah, yeah, like, you know, you're like—I mean, it's just nice when it comes up organically like that.

Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Kokuan. And then we'll shift. Oh, Miro, please.

I was just gonna say about, like, questions—I get in my own way, maybe whenever I think of a straightforward question, I can, like, Zen my way out of it, you know? And I can think of some Zen response. And I'm just like, I'm not gonna ask that because, you know, if I can kind of dharma combat myself, I don't need Shugen to do that for me.

I love that. I love that. And, like, how many times have you, like, asked the question that you're like, I know what they're gonna say, and it's, like, totally not that.

I usually don't ask.

Yeah, well, you might want to experiment with that.

Yeah.

Yeah, Kokuan.

Yes, you should. One thing I think is helpful, I noticed that a lot of times teacher will throw, like, a change-up. Like, sometimes they're abrupt and that's it, I'm out of here. Other times, more conversational. Other times pushing me. So a lot of times I'm kind of thrown off guard, which I think is helpful. Remember one time, Daido Roshi—I was listening to Myotai Sensei, she was giving a talk and she was talking about the Amazon on fire. And I went in and I gotta do something, you know, and he just kind of, like, turned into—we just had a conversation and, like, I walked out. I was like, how's that—yeah, why are you turning into cover? What was that all about? And it wasn't until later on, I think I understood what he was pointing to, like, what he was trying to say. So a lot of times, when I go into dokusan, I don't know what to expect. Sometimes what they offer is not what I expect, but it makes me think about what were they trying to point to. And a lot of times it'll dawn on me later on, sometimes years later. And so a lot of times these stay with me. I don't really understand at first, and not always, but sometimes they're like, ah, I think I know what he's pointing to. So thank you.

Yeah. That's a really—that sort of shake up—I mean, that's part of what's made possible, right, in that one-on-one conversation is—the teacher is, you know, ideally, is knowing the student, having a sense of how their mind works, like knowing, having a sense of, like, what is—like, who is this Kokuan? Who does he think he is, right? And then how do you, how do you interrupt that?

Taisho.

Yeah. There's a—it's actually a dedication and it—I came across it early and it's always stayed with me. I don't remember her last name—Obai's partner, Kate Larson. Yeah. So in her book Uncaged, she dedicates it to Daido, ""who had—to Daido, who had the patience to listen until I had nothing else left to say."" Beautiful. Just that sense of when you, when you in it for the long haul, there's this shedding of words. That wasn't it. That was pretentious. That was fake. That was a put on. That's me. And you just keep—it just, you just keep shedding it because you know, ultimately you're trying to point to something that's beyond words, right? And you keep avoiding that, you know, and Shugen's constantly challenging you by saying, ""Those are just words, those are just ideas. Show me. Don't tell me. Show me, show me."" And sometimes you go in to say, ""I got nothing, I got nothing,"" you know, and that's—and at that point, you're really right on that edge. And sometimes he can just shoo you over.

Yeah, yeah. Thanks, generous.

I want to shift. And just before we close, touch in on—what the heck. It must be like moisturizer. There was some on him earlier. We're in an infestation.

All right. I wanted to touch on commitment. Okay. And I think, again, pretty much everyone here knows either from direct experience or has a sense of that. There's quite a process here. There's a difference between showing up for teachings as we might on a provisional basis, either for retreat or sesshin or even for a long-term residency that's not yet a long, long-term teacher-student commitment. But there is a process here. That's one of the ways that training was established here—of making a commitment to a particular teacher for a lifetime, possibly. Yeah. And so I wanted to make sure that we touch on this. Like, what's the upaya of that? Why? And then also, what's the edge or the shadow there?

So I think that the upaya is that we're all in it always and it doesn't end. So commitment is seeing that, but the edge is we're always changing. So how do I make a commitment to something if I don't know who I'm going to be in the next moment or what the circumstances are going to be? So who or what am I committing to?

Yeah, the upaya is kind of like, in committing, it's like it invites the teacher to push you or to—that even if you feel uncomfortable, you're still committed. So, you know, it's not like there's kind of like a thing, well, if you make me feel too uncomfortable, then I'm gonna go up and leave, you know? Yeah. So it allows for more development. I feel like, in that way, that's really important.

I think that that's kind of the key—the key piece that I feel like I really see is that permission, right? So having gone through a process, having sort of asked in all of these different ways, like, ""Will you teach me? Can this person teach me?"" You know, Tangaryo, Guardian Council, all of those different gates of entry, there's a sense of like, okay, this person is serious. And so when it becomes a matter of things the teacher may say or do that will be uncomfortable or enraging even, that we're not going—like, the teacher won't do that, right? I mean, ideally, I think it would not be skillful for a teacher to be too strong with someone who hasn't made—who's not ready for that, right? Because then you're going to turn the person away from the Dharma, which is considered a really big deal in a bad way.

So there are certain things that won't happen in a teacher-student relationship unless there's a commitment made. And the student is really giving the teacher permission to work with them in that way.

What about the shadow? The shadow or the edge of commitment?

I think the edge is when the relationship gets unhealthy. And sometimes it is better to leave a teacher.

Yeah. Yeah. We can be so committed that we are stuck. We're trapped. And again, that's where we have to be, as students, we have to be connected to our own power, our own authority, so that if it's unhealthy, if it's no longer—maybe it's simpler than that, maybe it's just no longer a priority in our life—it's time then to dissolve that commitment, to step away.

Other shadows?

Robert.

And then, and then...

I think there can be periods of time where you just, maybe you don't feel like you're making any progress. You don't feel like it's going anywhere. And that can, that can be hard. But when you've made this commitment and you know, you're hoping for something to change or to shift and it's not happening.

Yeah. I mean, that's edgy. And it's also like, it's so beautiful in a way when we are held by a commitment, right? Because there—it will for sure—there will for sure be times where we feel like we're not sort of—we're, we're, we're, we're—again, Daido Roshi used to talk about like plateauing, you know, or we're not getting anywhere, we're just kind of spinning our wheels or it feels dead or dry. I mean, how many of us would have left practice if we took that as a cue of like, okay, game over, you know? For sure. Yeah. So the commitment allows that, you know, like a committed relationship—when it gets difficult or when it's boring, if the commitment is deep enough, you hang in there. And then things, things can turn.

I don't know if this falls into the realm of shadow, but something that I've struggled with over my period of time trying to find a teacher has been like not being able or feeling like I can't commit because of, like, location or, like, constraints. And that's just been—that's—I can't quite figure that out. I would, I'd be interested, like, and I guess, you know, maybe it's location, maybe it's, like, time zone things, maybe it's time commitment things. Yeah, that's just been something I've struggled with. Kind of similar to relationships of, like, feeling constrained on my mobility in my life.

Yeah, yeah, that's a real thing. That's a real thing because it is important to be able to show up. And also I think sometimes when those outer things are presenting, we should look and see, like, is there an inner piece that we're sort of projecting or reflecting outer. Is there a different kind of hesitation that we haven't gotten in touch with? Because a lot of those things can be worked with. Maybe not in our idealized version of a teacher or a teacher-student relationship, but in a real-world way. And that the urgency of our own bodhicitta has its own power. And there's a lot of ways, you know, I think of times where, thinking of Shugen Roshi and knowing that I had a teacher, even though I wasn't seeing him, I was far away, I wasn't in contact—that relationship was bigger than that and was still functioning.

Thanks. Yeah. So we're just about at time.

The one other thing I wanted to say that I've found to be an edge or maybe a shadow of the long-term commitment is we can, you know, form a relational dynamic because it's happening over so many years that gets a little bit solidified. And so to be aware of that, right, the way that I show up with my teacher—like, I think for myself, just speaking personally, I started training in Zen when I was quite young, 21. And so that youthful quality I had, you know, for many years, sitting in front of a teacher who was so much older, Daido Roshi, who's so much older than me, and feeling like the young acolyte, you know, and it's been, like, part of my own maturation to recognize how I still will bring that energy forward with Shugen, even though I'm 52, you know, and having to recognize that and be like, wait a second, wait a second. I've gotten solidified in this relationship and I'm, I'm doing it, I'm doing it. And so how do I, how do I shed that, you know?

Yeah, okay.

You know, thinking about, like, what—what is it that gives the teacher-student relationship its power? There's, like, so much power there. And it's not just, you know, it's not the power that we give to the teacher or the power that we have ourselves. It's the power of the Way. It's the power of the Dharma. And that metaphor of, you know, when we talk about, like, the Buddha meeting the Buddha or the, you know, the hen and the chick inside the shell, and the hen peck, peck, peck, peck on the outside and the chick on the inside, and then the shell breaking open. That mutual faith and trust, that aliveness.

I always used to wonder in sesshin, I would, like, you know, be going into face-to-face each day, and I could see like, oh, the teacher is—they're settling into their samadhi too. Like, they're definitely, like, the teacher at the end of sesshin is definitely in a deep place. And I'd be like, how does that work? Because I'm out there sitting my ass off. But they're, like, in the dokusan room responding to people kind of instantly. And, like, now that I've had the opportunity to taste what it is to be in that space, like, it's so—like, there's something else that's happening as people come in, in their zazen, with their minds settling, and it's like that energy is not contained in a body and it is transmitted.

So, yeah, the Way, encountering the Way.

One last thing: disappointment has to happen. It's part of the path. It has to happen. It doesn't mean that something's wrong. And also, we should know what the difference is between the disappointment of maturation, of letting our fantasies fall away, and the disappointment of having a boundary crossed or harm done.

So the Buddha taught the four reliances: to rely on the teaching, not the person; to rely on the meaning, not the words; to rely on the definitive meaning, not the provisional meaning; to rely on wisdom, not consciousness.

So may our evening here illuminate not only our own delusion and our own suffering. May it soothe not only our own fear and bring the joy of truth not only to our own lives, but may it extend expansively outward, unbounded, illuminating, soothing, bringing joy to all beings everywhere.

37846,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-04-04 12:59","BA15.2","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Eight Gates Of Zen: Part 2","","Good evening, everybody. Hello to all of you in your place. So, tonight we're continuing the study of the Gate of Zazen. A few weeks ago we looked at shikantaza, and tonight we're going to look at the koan. I had to really think a lot about this—there's so much that could be taken up around the koan, so I had to make some hard choices.

Maybe a good place to start is to just remember, or note, that a really essential aspect of Buddhist meditation, or one of the distinguishing aspects of Buddhist meditation, is that it involves the development of concentration, beginning with mindfulness and insight, or direct understanding, non-discriminating consciousness, awareness, and insight. Almost all, I'm going to guess, most forms of meditation incorporate some aspect of the calming that is part of Buddhist meditation—shamatha in the early tradition—calming the mind, developing concentration, samadhi, one of the three wheels of training that the Buddha laid out: the sila (the precepts, the moral teachings), concentration (samadhi), and insight (vipassana).

And so then the question is—it's clear enough, I think, how meditation is addressing the calming aspect. That's what everybody is introduced to when we give instruction in meditation in the beginning. That's pretty much what practicing the breath is: it's a concentration practice, it's developing the ability to bring one's mind to one place—the breath—and then practicing everything that comes along with that, that makes that challenging or difficult or unsteady, which is a whole world of thought and mind and emotion and dukkha, really. I mean, that's a lot of what we're contending with or meeting in the early years—and years can mean many years—where those things are primary. They're the primary things that are in front of us, which is oftentimes the very things that brought us to practice.

And for the most part, they're pretty easy to see. They're obvious, because we feel the discomfort and the suffering when we're experiencing it. And so learning how to meet ourselves or our mind, our thoughts, our emotions, our karma in a way that is cultivating compassion and calming the mind and the body—same.

What is less easy, perhaps, in a way, to make clear, is that—how then? Because that's something each of us can do, right? You focus on the breath, there's something very tangible about that. You see things arise, there's something very tangible about that. We see it, it's an object; emotion, it's not an object so much, but it's a visceral, physical experience. So there's something that's happening and we can address it. We can turn our attention to it, and in various ways that we learn, we can practice non-attachment.

The aspect of insight, by its very nature, is different because its very nature is to see that which is non-conceptual, to see that which is not something. Because anything that we gain insight into that is within the realm of conditioned existence is still dukkha, is still impermanent. It is coming and going.

And so all the ways in which we practice—thoughts and emotions and sensations and pain and so on—in the beginning, we're in a sense pretty much practicing them as though they are objects, they are things. They are things that are arriving on your doorstep, they're pushing at you, they're causing you some sort of experience and reaction. And so we practice them in a certain sense as though they're objects. You see a thought, you let it go, right? The language itself suggests that there is something to this object—like that you can both hold onto and you can let go. And there is a truth to that, because that's our actual experience. And there is a non-truth to that, because it's not an object. And ultimately, that's what we need to see. And that's what insight meditation is about. That's why that's so important, because it's seeing beyond the appearance—the sort of object-like nature of the thing—so that we're not just developing our capacity to do that forever, but never ultimately freeing ourselves, because we still see it, experience it, understand it, believe in it as something that has its own existence.

And so that's why the Buddha said that developing samadhi is really important in a whole host of ways and has a kind of transformative experience. Because when you're in a state of concentration, you feel different, right? You experience yourself, your mind, your body differently; you respond to things differently. You know, I mentioned that's why Daido Roshi stopped giving dokusan on the first day of sesshin, because everybody was just act—cranky, you know, and in a bad mood, right? Because they were getting settled in, but weren't yet. And so they were, you know, just a lot of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and they would bring that into dokusan. And he realized if he just waits a day, right? Then when they come in, a lot of that stuff's still there, but they're not as deeply sort of in it. We have continued that tradition, by the way. It's a fine tradition.

So what are those practices that help us to examine and see into the nature of the self? Because that's the fundamental thing. If self-clinging—the views of a sense of self, a separate self, autonomous—is the fundamental delusion, then we basically project that into everything else. So in the same way we see ourselves as something distinct and separate, we see everything else as distinct and separate from us. And so the insight aspect of meditation is to see into what's often spoken of as the two emptinesses: the emptiness of self and the emptiness of phenomena.

Let me just address this up front. So the question—sometimes it raises, whoa—why and when is a student assigned to work in a different way? We all start with the breath. And you know, of course, if somebody's practicing on their own, they'll choose whatever they do. But in training, when we're working with a teacher, we do that generally together with the teacher. The teacher guides us, which doesn't mean that the student can't present or speak about something—a form of practice they might feel very drawn to. So if a student feels drawn from breath practice to shikantaza, or feels a real affinity towards koan study, even if they haven't done it yet, that's important to know, right? Because that means there's an attraction there, there's an energy that's moving in that direction already. There's an interest. And so that's not absolutely necessary, but it can be very helpful.

Sometimes a student, you know, is impatient in working with the breath. It's like, ""Okay, I've done that. Now what?"" You know, and they sort of see these practices as, you know, sort of underclass, high class, extreme—you know, that they're ranked in the sense of, you know, low, medium, and high. And they're really not like that. They're really not that different, actually. I mean, each of these practices is fundamentally the same. They're just slightly different ways of working with your mind and awareness. And so when a student is impatient, that's not so good, right? Because then whatever that impatience is, they'll just bring that into the new practice, because that next practice is not going to make them practice differently. They're going to be the same person; they're going to be the same meditator. And so if we haven't really developed some foundation and stability with the breath, then we will have that lack of stability when we take up a different practice, which means we'll flounder in that different practice that is, in a way, could be seen as demanding a little bit more of us.

So the teachers generally are waiting to see the signs within the student and just for how their practice is developing, in terms of both their stability, their concentration, but also how they're working with their things—how much is coming up for them, how much of their karma, their history, things that they have been carrying around, how sort of prominent are those in their sitting, how are they practicing those? Because again, all of that will just carry on into whatever different form of practice is. So the practice itself is like a magic trick, you know, it's not like a magic key that unlocks the door. And also that these various practices are in a certain sense complete within themselves.

And also as we move on, you know, in a way what you're developing if you stick around long enough is you're broadening your capacity to draw on different practices. So a student who's practiced for a while and has various ways of practicing the breath, they've done shikantaza, maybe they've done some koan work. So they're learning how to work, how to practice zazen in different ways, how to work with their mind. And each of those practices is going to help them develop in different ways, some different ways. And that can be extremely helpful. And that, I should say, is going along with other meditation practices, like metta practices, the four immeasurables. Sometimes a mantra practice might be given to a student. Sometimes visualization practices are given to students. So there are different ways—these are all just different ways, basically, of addressing the fundamental matter.

So I wanted to draw on a few—so this question of insight in the earlier traditions, if you read Theravada teachings, particularly commentaries, and in certain schools of Tibetan Buddhism, you'll come across either analytic meditation, insight meditation. And so that question—when you see the word analytic, it sounds like, well, what are we sitting there and thinking about, meditation? That's not what it means. It means analysis in the sense of a penetrating examination of something that is striving towards being non-conceptual. So it's not sitting and thinking and contemplating, trying to figure something out—that's what we are trying to free ourselves of—but rather it's examining, or you might say analyzing, something to try and see into it in a way that is more true and clear, and in that way is freeing.

And so this is a text on Satipatthana by Analayo, and I just want to read a couple passages. So he just talks about the development of the self—independent, permanent entity—and that that basically inflates a sense of self-importance, centering ourselves in our lives amongst others, and that that sense of self needs to constantly be gratified, right? It's always hungry, it's wanting what it wants, right? We pursue desires, and it doesn't want what it doesn't want. And so it's this constant ongoing sort of feeding situation.

The Buddha spoke about delusion in terms of those as sort of having the sense of ""this is mine,"" which is my possessiveness; ""I am this,"" which is conceit. And in Buddhism, what that means is just having a sense of self. I mean, you can think of it as being conceited, but it more specifically is just having that sense of self. And ""this is myself."" So, ""this is mine,"" ""I am this,"" ""this is myself."" You see those three, those phrases used a lot in the early teachings that are pointing to different ways that we're relating to the self—this is myself, or all the views that I have about myself and then the world.

And so he goes on to say, a practical approach to this, this study of the self, is to keep inquiring into the notion ""I am,"" right? So we have that—once I recognize that sense of ""I am,"" that I have a sense of self, I see that self-awareness coming up, I recognize this sense of me, then we can begin to inquire into it. That sense of ""I am"" or ""mine,"" a sense of possession—of ""this is mine,"" it belongs to me. And he says, once this notion of an agent or an owner behind the experience has been clearly recognized, we see through that, then the above non-identification strategy can be implemented, which is, ""this is not mine, I am not this, this is not myself.""

So you could think of—I remember Robert Thurman was here years ago and he said, zazen practice is constantly disidentify, disidentify, disidentify, disidentify, which really means not grasping first. But more than that, it means sort of actively not identifying in moments when we are.

And so there are practices, beginning with the Buddha, and fundamentally, one of the fundamental practices is to bring that inquiry into the aggregates—the skandhas. So you think about, we chant the Heart Sutra every day, right? The prajna paramita, ""Gate Gate..."" doing deep prajna paramita, deep wisdom, samadhi, inquiring, meditation, clearly saw, inquired into, and clearly saw emptiness of the five conditions—the five skandhas. The skandhas are what the Buddha said: they're you, they're the person, they're how we create a sense, through a kind of a process, of this sense of ""this is mine, I am this, this is myself.""

And so the meditation is to actually direct your concentration into each of those skandhas—form, sensation. Your mind comes in, you come into contact with something that has a feeling. It might be a sensation in your leg, it might be a feeling arising within you, it might be tension around your eyes. And then there's a perception—we translate it as conception—where you're identifying it. And then there's mental formations—discrimination in our translation—which is what you're going to do next, the karma that you begin to create around that, your response. And then consciousness—being aware.

And so in this, you're inquiring, examining each of those skandhas in turn to see, to locate possessiveness, conceit, a sense of self and views. In other words, you're trying to see—because if those five aggregates are how we constitute a sense of self, okay, so let's examine each of those and see if we can find that self present within them. And then the Buddha went on to, in a somewhat elaborate way, to talk about different ways we can impute or invest a sense of self into the skandhas or the skandhas into the self. So there are about 20 different ways of analyzing the skandhas in this way. We're not going to go into that.

So I just wanted to mention that because it's one of the very early practices of consciously, deliberately taking up an inquiry, an examination through meditation, to try and turn one's attention to this sense of self that we all have. And it seems true.

Okay, so let me talk a little bit about the koans. I thought it was kind of interesting in Daido Roshi's book that has a lot of collections of different talks by different people. It's really—I haven't looked at it in a long time. I was really appreciating it. There's a lot of really nice talks and articles in here. And there's a letter from Hakuin to a student. Hakuin, of course, was a later 17th, 18th century Japanese master, very important in the Japanese Zen tradition, and was kind of a reviver, you might say, of the koan tradition, which had become, he felt, rather morbid and was dying. And so he put a lot of energy into that. And there's quite a lot of writing by Hakuin—it's rare to have that much direct writing, autobiographical information and letters that he wrote to students from any of these teachers. So there are a couple of several different books out on that.

But he writes—he's writing to somebody that he knew, a woman who was a lay practitioner, and he was writing about the one hand koan. So let me just get—let me just skip, I'll come back to that, what that was. But—so one of the first koans that he developed is, ""What is the sound of one hand clapping?"" You've probably all heard—it's been, like, popularized, right? It's used in—so he brings that up in the middle of this very long letter, which is, I don't know, like 20 pages. It's very long. He said he stayed up all night writing it. And so when he gets to the subject of the one hand, he says, this is the instruction:

""The sound of one hand is not a sound you hear with the ear. If at all times throughout the day you struggle with the sound of one hand without mixing in any intellectualization and staying aloof of the five senses, without bringing into play any words of logic or explanation, if you pursue it to the end, be that where it may be, then suddenly you break through to the source of your wandering in this realm of birth and death.""

That's it. Twenty pages of writing to this student about practice, about zazen. He has this somewhat lengthy section on the one hand, but three lines, instruction. So what does that mean? It means the student has to find their way. And that's one of the challenges. It's not that different than shikantaza. There's not that much to say. I'm surprised we spent two hours talking about it. I was just going to be for an hour and a half because I thought, well, probably that'll probably be more than we need.

And that is, in somewhat—maybe more than somewhat—to some degree, part characteristic of the Zen tradition, which is careful about saying too much about practice itself and about many things dharma, because of the tendency to latch onto that. It's like, ""Oh, I just do this. That's all I need to do."" And so, in a sense, you're given enough to arrive at your seat and turn your attention to that particular form of practice, but not so much that you sort of have it all mapped out in front of you. You're the map. You have to find your way.

And in essence, what we are told is, in a sense, what can be said. Everything else, in a certain sense, can be helpful. And there are teachings and teachers who will say a lot more. But that still doesn't prevent one from having to find your own way. And that's just something that's the way it needs to be, because each person is entering into a realm, in a certain sense, for the first time with a particular—in this case, a practice that you're given as your, in a sense, your vehicle, and, you know, motivated by your bodhicitta. And then you face your mind and you bring that, what you understand about that practice to that mind in all of the ways that it's going to present itself to you. And you learn. We learn how to make that, or discover that form of practice, to be deep and broad and powerful and multifaceted and flexible and dynamic.

So, the koan—in the breath practice, there's an object that we turn our attention to. Shikantaza—there is no object; we talked about that. In the koan, there's an object again, to speak of it that way. So for Hakuin, it was, ""What is the sound of one hand?"" And he says, you know, the sounds of two hands clapping, but what is the sound of one hand?

So remember that what the meditation inquiry, or insight meditation, is endeavoring to help us do is to go beyond trying to figure this out ourselves. Because we all come into practice with a deep trust in our thinking mind, right? It's how we've gotten most—so many—of our things done. And so this is just another problem. We're going to figure it out—and we won't, but that won't keep us from trying.

And so the practice, the insight meditations, are specific in the student's need to be alert to every time their mind starts to try and grasp onto this or to understand this with thought, or to explain it to themselves or figure it out or do what we've done in many other situations. The koan does that in a very unique way by, in many cases, giving you something that doesn't make sense, right? It doesn't conceptually, you know, make it easy to figure that out, right? Because it's not—we know what this is. But, you know, so, like, everybody will do that once in dokusan, right? Because what am I trying to do? Well, I'm trying to—I'm relying on what I know. I'm relying on what I think it must be. So the leap is to sit deeply with that koan in the mind and not think about it.

And of course, koans in that way are very dangerous because we're bringing language into our mind. And what is language for but to think about? And so that's why it's important to, you know, teachers—we will generally wait until a student has developed enough concentration that they can bring that koan in and not just tumble around with it. It's still going to be a challenge, but—and so—and that as they're entering into that koan more and more and losing their sense of not only conceptualizing, but distance, subject and object, right? So the sense of ""I am inquiring into this koan,"" it's really no different than you and the breath, you and awareness in shikantaza, letting that sense of subject and object begin to drop away because you're not creating it. ""This is mine, I am this, this is myself""—that is all subject and object, and it's all an activity of the mind. So what is it when the mind stops moving, stops creating the sense of I in this? And so the calling is to, by going into the question, into the inquiry, to lose, let go of that subject-making, object-making mind, because there's no distance anymore.

It's the basic principle behind when your leg hurts and you bring all of your attention to the pain, and you let that distance between you, the subject, and the pain, the object—""I am feeling this pain""—when that begins to dissolve, your actual experience of the pain changes. Now, logically, that doesn't make sense, right? Your leg hasn't moved. If pain is just a fixed thing, you're not creating it, right? Then why would—by not doing anything, by not creating a sense of subject and object—would the actual experience of the pain begin to transform? That should raise questions. So it's a very similar kind of principle in working with the koan, but here it's with a question.

So there are dangers with every form of meditation practice. There are dangers in the sense of places to get caught. And so, of course, one danger with koan introspection is just intellectualizing it. I mean, that's the easiest thing to do. There is something—there's something sort of intrinsically difficult about dharma practice, right? Because we have a lifelong habit of self and grasping and views. And to a large degree, we don't even know that. We don't even know that. And so a lot of practice is actually just bringing things up into our view so we can actually see what's—but then there's still the very strong grasping and belief and clinging.

What is very challenging about the koan training is it gives you a question that is to be resolved. And it is to be resolved not by getting an answer, but by entering into the reality that that koan is presenting you with. And in that moment, moment of intimacy—Dogen says ""intimate communication,"" right?—when their subject and object drop away, then the koan is realized. In other words, the dharma of what that koan is pointing to becomes one's own body and mind.

So, sort of intrinsic and ongoing danger of koan training is that the student intellectualizes. You know, there were many times, well enough in my own training, where I'd be studying with my teacher and moving along in koans, and Daido would at some point say, ""Shugen, you're getting intellectual again. You're getting intellectual again."" So it was like an ongoing vigilance, really, to check that, to be alert to that. And what I've seen in koan training—my own and others'—is that almost inevitably when a student, in the beginning, yes, it's to be expected. But even as a student goes on, when they get stuck on a koan, almost inevitably they'll start turning to their mind, their thinking mind, because they're frustrated, right? It's not yielding, they're not finding access, but they can always come up with something with thought, right? Every time. And so it's just something to be alert to.

So, intellectualizing is a danger, just having a mind that's thinking, you know, a mind that is not settled, that the koan—by taking the koan in, because it's language—can activate thought. And so that's part of what the student's learning how to do: hold that within stillness, within a state of concentration. And that's an ongoing practice, of course.

I mean, you know, some of this is obvious that is going to be sort of at risk, which is seeing the koan as a goal that is to be achieved, right? We all know how that goes. So here's something I want. It's presented to me in the form of a—I just need to get that thing. And then I'll have insight, I'll experience liberation, I'll be enlightened. So I need just to get that thing, right? And so it is not a thing. It cannot be gotten. But every student will fall into that because it's what we know. How else would we go about it? You know, so that's a real danger that the student's just going to have to work with, right? Which means recognize when they have turned it into an object that they are seeking to grasp. How will they know? Because they're getting discouraged, they're getting frustrated, they're getting pissed off. They don't like the koan, they don't like the teacher, they may not like the person sitting next to them. It can get big, right? And what's really happening is something is not clear. To me, that's really all that's happening. Something is not clear. I want to be clear, and something is not clear. But rather than just recognizing that, I do what we tend to do, which is externalize it, right? Because it's much easier to blame, right? The koan's bullshit.

I remember a student who was working on Mu, who left after a year of residency and was still working—was very frustrated—and as he was leaving, told me, ""You know, I figured out Mu."" I said, ""Oh, what'd you figure out?"" He goes, ""It's a scam. It's bullshit. There's no koan. There's nothing to see. It's just a way that teachers have enticed students to sit and keep sitting."" I said, ""Oh, okay.""

So, to be caught in a goal grasping, to believe that the koan has its own power—that if I work with a koan, if I have insight, if the teacher passes me on that koan, which basically means that they have recognized that the insight of the student that they've had with this koan is showing them what the dharma point of that koan is about—and that insight may be shallow, it may be deeper, but the danger is that the student thinks because of that, it has done something to me, that because of that, I have been given something, in a sense, and they don't understand that. It's that, you know, there are all depths of understanding and insight. That's why it's ongoing. And it's also, you know, what do I—how do I experience it? How do I relate to it? How do I live it? The koan doesn't do any of that for you. It doesn't make you a better person. It doesn't make you live in accordance with the precepts. It doesn't make you more compassionate. Right. So there's a danger in thinking that it has a kind of power. ""If I see this, I will never think, speak, or act from delusion again. I'll instantly be compassionate. I'll never cling to the self again. I'll be free."" I mean, if you read Wumen's commentary in the Gateless Gate to Mu, it sounds like you see that koan, you're done. Right. For most people, that's not true.

I think it's fairly predictable, even when warned, that the student will see the koan as a test of their worthiness: of a Zen student, of a koan student, of your understanding, and most fundamentally, just a person—whether you are worthy as a person. So that every time a student goes into dokusan and they don't see the koan, that's a failure, right? ""I am failing. What am I doing wrong? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with my practice?"" That's why we can at some point turn it against the koan, right? Turn it against the teacher. And so that's really a big one. That's a big one. And particularly if a student—I mean, if a student that I know, a student has struggles more than your average bear with insecurity, self-doubt, you know, if I, you know, ask them to begin doing koan study or they ask to do koan study, I usually give them a fairly hefty warning. I say, look, this is what's going to happen. You're going to get to a point where you think you're not seeing something. I mean, I just lay it all out there, knowing this is not really going to help because you're going to forget we ever had this conversation, because I did. And even if you remember it, you'll think, ""Yeah, but that's not what's happening here. What's happening here is really, I am failing. I am not good. I am not a good student.""

But for all of those same reasons that I just spelled out, koan training can be incredibly powerful. If you are defeated by yourself in any of these ways, then the koan is not helping, right? But if in the face of possible defeat, you rally and you start shifting, you know, rather than just keep hammering on the same nail, hoping for different results, you actually realize, ""Oh, maybe I have to do something different."" You know, I remember—I mean, so many moments for me, but that sense of failure, of failure, of failure, of failure, you know, ""What is wrong with me? Why can't I get this right? You know, I must really be disappointing my teacher."" You know, all of this, it was completely making it all up. None of it was actually true, but it seemed very true to me. And there was a certain point when I realized—you know, I came out—the worst was when I went into dokusan before I had even talked, and I was rejected. You know, I didn't see the koan, so I have no right to even open my mouth, you know, it was just like—it was like it didn't even matter, you know, up to a certain point, how much, you know, how long I'd been practicing and stuff, it was just like, okay, it's like this happening for the first time.

And there was a point at which I thought, what is really happening here? What is happening is there's a point, dharma point, a point about myself, about reality, that this koan is trying to help me see, and I am not seeing it. That's what's happening. And once I framed it to myself in that way, and I thought, oh, but that's why you're here. That's why you came. That's what you want to do. So the koan is helping me to do that thing that I actually want to do, and that really helped shift it for me. So then, rather than seeing it as my enemy, you know, that was confirming my inadequacy, I saw it as my ally, you know, this is how I am helping myself.

There's a lot about—I'll say a little bit more, and then we'll take some questions. But there's a lot of—I wanted to read this. This is J.C. Cleary. Christopher Cleary is a brother of Thomas—they're both translators of many, many texts. And this is an old book. But he talks about a lot of the misconceptions around koans that I don't hear so much, but I think they're probably still out there. So I thought I'd read about some of this. And he talks about the whole idea that Zen and koan study is anti-intellectual, anti-rational, it's irrational, right? And he says, you know, the people are just projecting their own ideas onto that. You know, the Zen—I mean, a lot in the earlier, there was a lot of thinking that Zen was iconoclastic, you know, that we burn the Buddhas, you know, we don't bow, you know, it's—you don't need all that stuff. And so people were very surprised when they came and saw an altar and we did prostrations, and it was disciplined. And so that sort of anti-intellectual idea.

And then he goes on to say that reason in Buddhism is—he said, the problem with reason, according to the Buddhist masters, is that it's trapped in a limited and arbitrary conditioned view of the world. Our ability to think and reason is incredibly important. It's incredibly important, and it's important in dharma practice. But we're trying to release it from the ways in which it's been trapped and limited and conditioned by ourselves in our world. So that's all the stuff that comes up when we're sitting is all of that. And when we do koan training, that's what comes into the koan. That's what we're wrestling with, you know, before we even get to the koan, really.

He said, reason becomes entangled with our biases, our desires and aversions. It's limited by the categories we have conditioned and believe in, sort of absolute realities. So he says, Buddhist analysis, insight, examination, inquiry, focuses on what he calls the psychological conditioning that shapes perception. And think of psychological as just the totality of your mind. Don't think of it as just in terms of psychology, but sure—the totality of your mind that shapes perception, creates common sense, reason, and makes it seem objectively true. So the self seems to be an objective truth. I see myself, I am aware of myself. There is a subject, myself, and an object—or subject, my awareness, and an object, myself. So I can create that dualistic split, the fundamental split within my very person.

And so then, when you think about how the Buddha said, okay, so turns out that examination towards that very self that you believe in and that is constructed through these various steps we call the skandhas. He says, Buddhist adepts, experimentally—and I would say experientially—discover, verify, and he says, map out, I would say, gain understanding—a form of perception that goes beyond the confines of conditioned, common sense reason. And I think by common sense, think of just relative understanding, things everybody believes.

He says, so the task of Zen and other forms of Buddhist teaching is not to abolish or destroy the intellectual faculty, but to free it from its conditioning, to purify it, and to allow it to function in an accurate, dispassionate way. In other words, to make it even more powerful, most powerful. So part of this process involves breaking the moment-to-moment tyranny of the conditioned intellect, showing the contradictions and absurdities to which this leads.

And then he goes on to say that misconceptions are that koans are just paradoxes, that they present paradoxes and that are issues to stay alive. The idea of a paradox is just an idea—when conceptually we think about this or that, we can create a sense of paradox. But in reality, there are no paradoxes. He says they shouldn't be understood as mere exercises or egocentric contests for intellectual supremacy. Sometimes, I mean, a common thing is people think of them as, you know, sort of performative. You have to come in and do something zany, do something not irrational, you know, turn a cartwheel, you know, there's a koan of Nansen kills the cat.

Monks of the Eastern and Western hall were arguing about the cat, and Nanquan came in and said, ""Look, if you can say a true word, I won't kill the cat."" Nobody could speak. So he killed the cat. That night, Zhaozhou comes back. He was away. Nanquan told him what had happened, and Zhaozhou put his sandals on his head and walked away. So that's a very good example of what—and so you can think, ""Well, just do something silly, right? Do something crazy."" When people—when I hear people talk about or read teachers who speak about the koans in that way, it always confuses me because I think, if you really believe that's what it's about, is that helping you? Like, do you think that's why these have continued to be passed down all these years? It's just to come to that idea? That doesn't change anything. How could one be satisfied with that?

But Daido Roshi told the story of once in Maezumi Roshi—they were doing dharma encounter, and everybody was lining up just like we did on Sunday. And there was a new student who stood there, and he took off his shoes and put them on his head. And Tetsugan or somebody leaned over and Daido said, ""Get that guy out of here."" They're not battles of wit. They're not puzzles or riddles. He said, the real answer to the answer, quote unquote, to the koan, is not a sentence or gesture in response to the teacher's question, but the change in the student's state of mind and body. And that's really the key—through the practice of the koan, it's bringing about a shift in the mind and body state of the practitioner, which is what allows them to encounter the point, the dharma teaching of that koan. And that, by teaching, I just mean, you know, I realized reality.

Okay, so just a couple more things so we can open this up. Then I'll kind of be done with my introduction. So one of the things that traditional koans, particularly as they developed in, well, in China, is the sense of doubt, spiritual doubt. You know, bodhicitta, the aspiration to liberate oneself and others, could be thought of as just a great aspiration. But in a sense, it's just a very profound question: How do I liberate myself? What is not liberated? What needs to be liberated? What do I turn my attention to? What is it that is binding me?

And so the koans recognize, you might say—and this is sort of speaking from the side—that sense of urgency, of question, of wanting to understand something is one of the most powerful forces in the human realm, right? And all too often it's directed towards—well, very often it's just directed towards other things: making money, you know, doing something, you know, with oneself, which can have value, of course, but in dharma practice, it's directly being directed towards liberation. And so the koan basically holds that sense of urgency, that sense of what Daido Roshi used to call the spiritual imperative, what is chanted every night in the evening gatha, that is trying to, right, arouse that sense of urgency, of immediacy, of impermanence, right? So that we don't become complacent.

So, but what do you do with that? What do you do with that energy? So in the koan training, you channel it into the koan. So in koan training, there is—in the koan lineages which came to be in Japan—raised, recognized primarily as the Rinzai or Linji and the Soto or Caodong. So in each lineage there will be some different course of koan training, you could say. So there's always a first koan, which is really fundamental because it's a complete wilderness. The student has never really done this before. And the essence of that koan is to see into their self-nature, the reality body, to realize the self is empty, and to have that first direct encounter.

And so the first koan is always very particular. So the koan Mu, the koan ""sound of one hand,"" the sound of ""what is your original—the face you had before your parents were born""—those are three of probably the most commonly used. Mu is probably the most commonly used of all. But because they, you know, they don't really—although we can intellectualize them, that's not going to take you very far. So they don't give you a lot of meat to chew on and get caught up in. And they're very succinct, they're very direct, and they are directed directly towards oneself.

And in the development of koan in China, Dahui, who was a great proponent of koans and helped to establish a lot about how koan practice went, he talked about what he called the huatou. So if you think about the mu koan—so, student asks Zhaozhou, ""Does a dog have Buddha nature?"" The obvious answer is, yes, everything has Buddha nature. And Zhaozhou says, ""Mu,"" no. So that's the dialogue, right? The huatou is ""What is Mu?"" So what Dahui said is that with the koans, to distill them down to their essence, their sort of pivotal seed phrase or word or question, so that that's what the student is holding in their mind. And they're not getting caught up in a lot of, you know, verbiage. And so that element is part of—very often students need to do that, particularly with more advanced koans. It can be quite complex and there's a lot of language, and they need to really discover what is the question that's being asked. Because a lot of koans don't ask questions. They just present you with something, but they don't actually explicitly ask a question. So the student has to see what is being asked here? Like, what am I inquiring? And then once that koan is seen, then there are subsequent koans that are similar—not similar, but they're called miscellaneous koans. And they are to help clarify what Mu helped a student to initially discover. And there were originally 200. In our training, when I did them, they were 200. At a certain point, Daido Roshi winnowed them down to 100. He wanted to make less, but have people take longer and work with them more deeply.

So one of those is, ""How do you stop suffering?"" So that would be an easy question to sit and contemplate. You can come up with a hundred different ways to stop suffering. And all of them, probably most of them would be good—and good if you did them—but they have nothing to do with the koan, because the koan is always taking you to the fundamental, right, which, in a sense, is not what you can practice. That's not something you can practice. It's more the ground of things. And so then in that koan, the student has to keep letting go of any thought they have about how to stop suffering.

From the Diamond Sutra, there are a number of koans: ""It is not a world,"" the Buddha said, ""and for this reason, it is called the world."" So there is an example of taking a sutra, a line from a sutra, and presenting it as a koan. So for the koan students, it's a really wonderful opportunity to learn how they can work with all kinds of different texts and bring them to that kind of intensity. There are koans directly from the Heart Sutra: ""Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."" There are koans that deal with language: ""With your throat, mouth, and lips closed, how will you speak?"" There are koans that deal with obvious dualities: the koan of—it's like a person hanging from a tree. You're hanging by your mouth from a branch. You can't touch the branch with your hands. You can't wrap your legs around the trunk. You're just dangling. And somebody comes and says and asks you an essential question that their life depends upon. If you answer, you fall to your death. If you don't answer, to save yourself, then you forsake that person. What will you do?

So there are koans that make it very real, right? Who are you going to choose? Is there another way? It's not magical thinking, right? It's not Disney. It's not being a superhero. It's letting go of a dualistic way of thinking, right, and entering to it directly.

There are koans that will clearly bring up sort of karmic tangles. Fayan, one day, as he was getting ready to give teisho, pointed to the blinds where the sun was streaming, and two monks got up and rolled the blinds up—exactly the same. And Fayan said, ""This one has it."" No, he actually didn't point to them, he said, ""One has it and one doesn't."" What do you think everybody in that zendo was thinking, was wondering, right? What do you think those two monks were thinking? So it's like throwing gas on a fire, right? You want to be the one that has it, right? You want to have it. You don't want to not have it. And so there are koans that just go right for the jugular in that way.

So let me just finish, and then we'll take a little break and then come back and just open this up. But I wanted to read from a couple passages of Dogen to just show how he brings in this sense of inquiry without ever saying anything about a koan. So he's talking about koan Mu. He said, ""Does a dog have Buddha nature?"" Zhaozhou said, ""No."" And then Dogen says, ""Can you gauge this word no, Muji? Can you contain it? There is no place at all to grasp its no's. Please try letting it go. Let it go and just look. What about your body and mind? What about your conduct? What about life and death? What about the dharma of the Buddha, the dharma of the world? What about, after all, the mountains, rivers, and great earth, the people, beasts, houses, and dwellings? If you keep looking and looking, the two attributes of motion and rest will naturally become perfectly clear, no longer arising. Yet when these attributes do not arise, this does not mean that you have become rigidly fixed. There are many people who fail to realize this and are confused about it. Do not stop, press on."" So he's presenting all of these questions. Is that just, you know, to fill a page? He's presenting different ways of inquiring, of examining.

In another fascicle on the King of Samadhis, he says, ""Know that the world of sitting practice is far different from other worlds. Clarify this for yourself, and then activate aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana. Now study the world. At the very moment of sitting, is it vertical or is it horizontal? At the very moment of sitting, what is sitting? Is it an acrobat's graceful somersault or the rapid darting of a fish? Is it thinking or is it not thinking? Is it doing or is it not doing? Is it sitting within sitting? Is it sitting within your body and mind? Is it sitting, letting go of sitting within sitting or letting go of sitting within body and mind?"" It's very—I don't know if he was drawing directly from those practices the Buddha laid out in terms of how we impute the self into the skandhas, skandhas into the self, but it's very evocative of that.

And then he says, ""Investigate this in every way possible. Sit in the body's meditation posture. Sit in the mind's meditation posture. Sit in the meditation posture of letting go of body and mind."" And so Dogen, of course, is the great proponent of shikantaza that we think of as objectless, goalless, non-directed meditation. And that is how we generally teach shikantaza. But no form of practice is fixed or rigid or monolithic, right? And that the question, in a sense, with shikantaza is how is that inquiry brought in? How does that inquiry exist within shikantaza?

Okay, so I hope I've not said too much to dull your mind. So let's take a break, freshen your mind, and then we'll come back, see if there are questions or comments that people would like to ask.

---

During the shikantaza mando, you referred to this expression, ""Don't make a Buddha and don't interfere with the making of the Buddha."" That's Dogen. Sorry, that's Dogen. And how does one apply that to koan study?

Well, the koan is the point of one's attention. And so if a person is sitting with a koan and trying to make a Buddha, they're not sitting with a koan. So, I mean, that's the tension, right, that the koan presents to the student: you're presented with a question or something that needs to be resolved. So it's really not different than shikantaza. I mean, there is something that is to be resolved, right? It's just not given that direction and that sort of focal point and the question, although that's why I think it's important to recognize how, you know, these questions that Dogen is asking, you know, these more explicit forms of analytic meditation that exist within different traditions—it's, I don't know, I mean, I'm sure in the Zen tradition, as Buddhism was coming to China, that those practices were coming, you know, they were reading about those practices. Well, you know, it seems to have evolved in a way that those weren't sort of carried along, you know, with the teachings that developed in Zen in terms of applying those specific practices. That's why I think it's interesting when they show up without, you know, calling them anything—Dogen just embeds those questions in the context of a teaching.

But the tension is that there is something that the student—I want to resolve. I want to be clear about this. I want to know my true self. But how do I hold that? How do I practice that without turning it into an object that I'm going to grasp? You know, because in a way, that's all I know. That's what I've done in my life. And so the way I discover that is by grasping, suffering, letting go. Grasping, suffering, letting go, until I find: how can I hold that deep desire, that deep wanting, that deep caring, but without the clinging? So that's what makes it difficult, is that we have to go through those many times, those many experiences of falling into the very thing that we're trying to free ourselves of. And when we do that, it's not abstract, you know, it's not neutral. It's painful. You know, there is struggle, and it's the same struggle that we're trying to free ourselves of through practice. It's the struggle that brings us to practice. But now it sort of gets focused in zazen on the koan, and that's where it can get all tangled up.

---

See if I can phrase this in a succinct way. You mentioned, like, the ways in which a koan is answered. Seems like it's an embodied piece of wisdom that's unique to the person who experiences it and in the moment that they display to the teacher. I'm curious if it's—is it a momentary experience, or is it something that's lasting and shifting, like it changes the person internally? Which my guess is yes. But is it something that's able to be summoned up? You know, essentially, the answer to the koan, summoned up by the person?

Yeah, yeah. No, because then it's willful, you know, then it's, ""I am bringing something forth,"" which means I have to have something I'm bringing forth, and there is a subject and object distance. No, that's why it's challenging. I mean, if we could be—if it could be realized willfully, everybody would be enlightened, right? So that's the challenge, is it takes effort and wholeheartedness, but without self-clinging. And most of us just don't know what that experience could be like. I mean, sometimes people even argue, ""I can't—there is no love without attachment."" It's like, no, actually real love is without attachment. But we just tend to get attached when we love, and so we conflate them as the same thing. That if there's something that is very important to me that I am seeking, then it is a goal. How else will I achieve it if I don't establish it as a goal that I am trying to seek?

And so going back to that passage that Sogen was pointing to, Dogen says, ""Be it known that for studying the way, the established means of investigation is the pursuit of the way in seated meditation."" So he's holding up meditation as really essential. And the essential point that marks this investigation, this sort of is the foundation by which we are investigating, is the understanding that there is a practice of a Buddha—that's you—that does not seek to make a Buddha, which is exactly what you want to do. You want to make a Buddha, right? And he's saying the essential point of the investigation that we're undertaking in zazen is that you are a Buddha and you are and want to realize that, but you must not seek to make a Buddha. He said, ""The practice of a Buddha not making a Buddha is the realization of the koan."" In a sense, that's when it's real. That when, like, what is your original face, the face you had before your parents were born? So it's not this face, it's your fundamental face, it's your fundamental nature. So when the student holds that question so deeply that they enter into the—in a sense they become—the original face, which is not something of their own doing, but rather by letting go so deeply of any doing such that all that's left is the original face, then in that moment of intimacy, it's realized. And that moment itself is the, you know, sort of a puzzle because how can you realize that which is not something, and it can only be realized when there is a merging or dissolution of subject and object. But for something to be realized, somebody has to realize it, right? And so that's where a student can experience—and this, this is in any practice—can have an experience of some direct encounter with their self-nature, and it's not a realization yet because it's not actually apparent to them. It is a cognized, and so that may come at some other time. Sometimes in koan training, in dokusan, if a student is really inside of the koan, they may be presenting it—this is particularly true of the first koan, because they have no basis, no history to know that—sometimes they're presenting the koan, the teacher may be asking them questions to probe into their understanding, and the student is answering the questions before they've even realized they've realized it. In other words, the koan itself is speaking. They're speaking directly from that place, and it's not yet apparent in their mind. In other words, in a sense, they haven't seen, but in that moment, they see as it's being, in a sense, unveiled. And so there's this sort of liminal place, right, that's not a place. And that's why it can't be done. You know, we can't make it happen. We can't make it come about. But what we can do is make the conditions for that ripe. And that's really what all the practice is about. Doesn't matter—I mean, that starts right away with the breath. You're making yourself ripe to be a true human being.

---

Kusay asks, ""Do koans help to dissolve, dismiss, or deeply see the stories that get in the way of living in the moment?""

I think so, because in order to get close to, I mean, the koan, to the breath, to an awareness, we have to recognize when we're telling a story, when we're identifying the self with something or something with the self, because that will stop us. That will just hold us right there. And so whatever our practice is, those aspects of the self, of our karma, that come up that are very strong, have to be both recognized and practiced, which means to not be rejected, but also to not be grasped and become entangled in. And so in that way, a beginning practitioner can practice that. I mean, that is what we give instruction in, is practicing just that. And in that way, we're beginning to free ourselves of that impulse to deny or to claim. We're discovering a middle path, right, that is freeing ourselves in that moment of either of those entanglements.

And as I said earlier, we can do that, and that's profound and good, and the sense of that thing that I am not rejecting or clinging to, still in my awareness, my experience is a thing. I still experience it as something that is happening to me, that is coming and is exerting a force on me and has some kind of force in and of itself. So that basic delusion can still be intact. And that's again, why the introspective or insightful nature of zazen is so important.

---

Follows that up with, ""Seeing the koan—does it happen suddenly?""

Yeah, usually. I mean, sudden is just a word, you know, that sort of tracks time. But there is a moment—I mean, just think about in any moment in your life when there's—when I was in college, I took an upper-level geometry course, and one of the early days, and I was studying here already, and the teacher one day talked about working on a theorem, you know, working on a proof. And he was getting really worked up. And he says, you know, it starts to consume you and you don't go home, you stop taking baths, you forget to eat. And I was like, oh man, he's like doing koan training. It's like consuming, you know, in other words, I have to know. Of course, he was talking as a mathematician and having that kind of passion. And then what he said, and then there's a moment where something shifts. You can't predict it, you can't make it happen. But suddenly something that was not seen is seen. It's like there's a crack or there's an opening and it becomes clear.

And so we have those moments. Creative work, in science—I mean, it can happen in all kinds of endeavors. And it's usually the result of a very concentrated period of time in which there's a lot of very focused energy that can often be very difficult because something is not clear, something is not resolved. So we have to learn how to hold that uncomfortable experience. And then sometimes it comes right out of that, but often it comes out of a moment—a subsequent moment—where you just forget about it. In other words, the mind relaxes. I remember once when I was doan or jisha and I was working on a koan and I went in to see him and I didn't pass it. And I was frustrated and discouraged. I went back to my seat and then dokusan was over. So I went in and he was doing his bows. And as I went over to do my bows, standing bows with him, it became clear to me at that moment—I was not working on it anymore. You know, and so sometimes it happens in that moment of release because we've released, it's like we've relaxed and are no longer focusing on it. So, but, you know, there's no predictable nature.

And just to keep saying that, you know, so much of what we can say about the koans is true about any form of meditation. So it's really important not to see the koan as some, you know, thing that is, you know, and sort of elevate it to a special place. The Buddha didn't do koans, right? Most Buddhists don't do koans. It's just a way of—it's a skillful means that evolved in a particular way in the Zen tradition, within some Zen traditions, because, you know, it can—because of it, for different reasons, I guess. And partly, you know, I do emphasize them in my teaching. And so that can convey a sense of that if you're not actively working on the koans, then, you know, something's missing. It's not—not at all.

---

So you said that everyone has Buddha nature, and then also that you mentioned something about delusion. So is it the case that a Buddha can have delusions, that the Buddha—what? That a Buddha can have delusions or be deluded?

Well, it depends on how you understand Buddha. So in Buddhism, there is one perfectly enlightened being—a Buddha—in sort of an eon or some vast period of time. And so Shakyamuni was the Buddha of our time, 2,500 years ago. And that before Shakyamuni, there have been Buddhas going back, because there's no beginning of time in Buddhism. And so the Buddha was just the enlightened being of our time, and that his realization was complete in the sense that he saw all that there was to see. So that's the sort of the essential meaning of Buddha. So in that, the Buddha is a Buddha because he's free, there is no more delusion, right? There's no more deluded thoughts or speech or action, that even the capacity or the sort of sources of that have been realized, have been liberated.

Particularly in the Mahayana tradition, we use Buddha more liberally, right? Drawing from Buddha nature. So because we have the nature of Buddha, we have—our mind is fundamentally an enlightened mind. Our minds are not different from the Buddha's mind. We speak in that way of being a Buddha, which doesn't mean I am a realized being, but it means I have the same nature, right? Which both means I have it already—it's already present within me—and it also means I have the potential to realize that. It has both of those meanings.

---

This is from Kiho. ""I think Shindo wanted to ask a question, but go ahead while she's getting the mic. Okay, from Kiho, can you please speak about how working with the Faith Mind poem relates to koan practice and also a bit about the origin/intention behind using this as a form of practice that is different from shikantaza and formal koan study?""

Yeah, that's a good question. I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to mention that. So years ago, Daido Roshi, after years of teaching and teaching many shikantaza students, talked about—he talked with me and I think Mihotai at that time about how, you know, about how the depth and breadth of the power of shikantaza. And because of its nature, one of the characteristics is the student is not engaging with dharma teaching in their meditation, right? It's objectless. And one of the things that does happen in koan training is you're working with language, but you're also working with dharma teachings. Because a lot of the koans, like those teachings from the Diamond Sutra, that koan that I did recently, that was drawing from the Diamond Sutra, that, you know, that ""because of all of my misdeeds of the past, you know, the scorn and revilement that I'm experiencing in the present moment, by virtue of that experience, I am thus liberated."" So—and I talked in that talk about how, you know, you could look at that from the point of view of understanding karma, how karma works, and how the consequences of my past actions will bear fruit in some misfortune, some, you know, negative experience that I'm having in the present. And that becomes the moment when I can shift that karma by how I respond to it. And I said, but as a koan, that same phrase is not asking for those explanations. It assumes the student already knows that, because you're a practitioner. It's asking, what is the fundamental basis? What is the nature of karma? How do you fundamentally free yourself, not just by practicing the precepts and not getting into trouble, but actually in a more liberative sense? And so the koans help the student develop their dharma understanding in that way, both directly but also in literature.

And the other valuable part of it is that you're articulate. You have to express yourself in relationship to the dharma. So the student is coming in—there are a lot of koans, particularly early on, that don't require any language. It's embodied, right? You're presenting the living experience of that koan in a way that doesn't need language. But at a certain point, the student needs to begin to bring in language and learn how to, as we say, speak, express their understanding in live words. Which means, don't explain it, don't describe it, but convey it so that when you speak it, I'm experiencing that—you're not explaining it to me, but you're giving me the direct experience of that. And the student, that is more challenging. So the student has to develop their ability to articulate, which means it's going to get clearer.

So what Daido Roshi did was he began having students working with the Faith Mind in the beginning. I mean, he also worked with the Genjo Koan and Mountains and Rivers Sutra. But the Faith Mind is particularly well suited because it works in couplets or single lines, so you're not holding too much. And rather than a koan, where you're taking it and focusing on it directly, the student holds that line in their mind at the beginning of sitting. And just—the image I have is you're dropping a teabag into hot water and it infuses, right? And so you're holding that line in your mind, just letting it infuse in your body. You're not thinking about it, you're not trying to figure anything out. You're just letting it fill your consciousness, planting that seed. And then you let go and you just do your sitting. You're not bringing it up, you're not trying to think about it. If the lines do arise, you treat them like any other thoughts. So you're not really shifting how you do shikantaza, except at the very beginning. It's like an oblique way of gaining an understanding rather than looking directly. You know, on a very dark night, if you look at stars and you want to look at a particularly faint star, if you look straight on, sometimes you can't see it. But if you look off to the side, there—is it the rods or the cones on the side that pick up faint—and then you can see it. It's sort of like that. It's like you don't look at it directly, but you sort of plant the seed.

And in that way, through sitting, could be through contemplating off the cushion, and then in dokusan, you know, I ask the student, well, how do you understand this? It gives me an opportunity to see where their understanding is. It allows me—it gives me a chance for the teachers to ask questions. There have been many times where the student will bring something up and I'll give them one of the koans to sit with it that is directly related to what they're—because they're already sort of encountering something. It's like, okay, why don't you work on it in this way? So in that way it can move in different directions. But fundamentally, it's not the same because you're not intentionally directing your attention to it and trying to resolve it in that way that the koan student is. So it's a little more indirect, and that the, you know, the face-to-face is very dependent upon the student. So for some people, it's just, you know, they're discussing it, they're sort of explaining how they understand it, because that's where they're at. For some students, they may be able to work with it at a little bit more direct level, deeper level, so it can evolve. So that's a long answer to a short question.

---

Shindo: Well, that kind of answered my question. And so I'm not sure if I still have one. But I was curious about—in koan practice, as I understand it, you know, there's—well, the word kensho, right? Like a moment of seeing clearly into self-nature. And I was wondering about in other forms of practice, it's not kind of taken up in the same way. There's no kind of, I don't know, clarifying of that or testing of it or affirming or denying, right? Like it's, in my understanding, it seems more spacious or—

Yeah. Well, think of Dogen, you know, when he was in China with Rujing, he was just sitting. I was thinking about this because I was reading recently, rereading something, and it was saying that Rujing, they used to sit until about 11. And then it said at—I think it was either 1 or 1:30 or 2:30, they washed their face, which I think meant they were getting up. And so if you think you got it rough waking up at 4:30, just telling you. And at one point there's a—Dogen speaks about how some of the monks came to him and said, ""Teacher, like, we're dying here. Come on, you know, can we wake up a little bit later?"" And he said, ""If we wake up later, you'll still be sleeping."" He said, ""It won't help."" But they were all sitting, and Dogen was sitting, and Rujing was walking around—I think he had a sandal and was slapping people because they were falling asleep. And he said something about, you know, dropping off body and mind. And that seemed to have precipitated Dogen's realization. I don't know, you know, exactly what happened, but I can imagine that in that moment he was dropped off body and mind. And in that moment when his teacher said that, it was like he realized it, right? Because he then got up and he went to his teacher's room. And that was the koan I presented recently. So it just happens with shikantaza by its nature, generally in a more subtle way, whereas the koan tends to be more direct, because that's its nature.

But the thing about the koan that's important to understand is—I talked a little bit about the dangers. And, you know, it takes time. And so, you know, I was at a sesshin many, many years ago where there were two people in that sesshin who saw Mu. One had been sitting with Mu for about six months, and the other person had been sitting with it for 20 years. And that person was very mature, very successful, was clergy—like, they had all these credentials that you think would make them an easy shot. And it didn't matter. It didn't matter whether it took six months or 20 years. And that's sort of the spirit that the student has to take. And we live in a very patient culture in a very impatient time. And students can get very impatient with the conversation quickly.

Daido Roshi told a story of when Maezumi Roshi was here of one of his students, Daido's students—Teshu perhaps—who was working on Mu and went in to see Maezumi Roshi, Daido Roshi's teacher, and said he was working on Mu. And something like, Maezumi said, ""How long have you been working on it?"" And Teshu said something like, I don't know, a year or two years. And he just rang them out and said, ""I don't even want to talk to you.""

---

So Roshi, could you speak about capping phrases and if they have any legitimate role in our tradition?

So one of, and this is something that developed in the koan training in literature was the use of poetry and the use of what's called a capping phrase. So if you think of all the poems that are written for each of these koan collections that we draw from, those are verses that are basically encapsulating a capping phrase for a point or various points of the koan. So it's a poetic way of expressing live and through the beauty and wonder of poetry, which generally isn't definitive. It's not descriptive and explanatory. And so the classical koans provide those verses which the students in our lineage have to present as koans. But students in their training can be asked periodically to present the koan as they understand it and now present it as a capping phrase, present it in poetic form. And that can be much harder, right, because they're trying to draw—they have to go back into that experience and try. And how would they express something that is, in essence, inexpressible? And in a way that conveys that sense of aliveness. And so, again, it's a way of clarifying and being able to articulate in a live way. That's why poetry has been such an important part of the Buddhist tradition.

But we are not using capping phrases in our training—not in the way that it was developed in Japan, which was intensely academic. I mean, student, you read Victor Hori's book, I mean, this—hours and hours and hours and hours pouring over. And, you know, so, no, we don't do that. And I think that's appropriate, you know, for us, you know, as—I mean, I even didn't have that training, so hard to speak of that way.

---

But you sort of touched on this already, but—and maybe you don't have more to say on it—but if you do this, you know, Daido Roshi used to speak about kind of the affinity that people would have for shikantaza or for koan study. And do you find that to be—like, he would sort of sketch, you know, kind of sketch a profile of, here's your shikantaza student, and here's your koan student. And I just wondered if you find that to be true or helpful.

I don't know. You know, I don't know that I—I don't think I really use that. I mean, you know, I heard that, and I reflected on that a lot when he was teaching. And I—I don't know that I—you know, he would often talk about shikantaza is good for people who really have a deep faith in dharma, practice, in zazen, don't necessarily have a very strong, you know, sort of inquiring impulse or mind. And I think certainly there's a validity there, you know, in terms of sort of an affinity. He would say that sometimes people who are very intellectual, tend to really engage things intellectually, koan can be very good for them because—because it'll make them crazy. It'll help them to try and release that impulse, that way of experiencing things and turning towards things.

So it's also—it's such an evolving thing that—particularly with the first koan, because it's, you know, it's such new terrain. And if it, you know, these questions don't necessarily resonate with the student in a way—they don't make sense. Like, I know what I'm feeling, I know what I sort of am yearning for, but how does this question—it doesn't seem to speak to that, right? And so what the student has to do, and that's part of its function, actually, is because otherwise I might just get embroiled in how I feel and what I'm thinking and everything I've thought about. So in a way, it's more flavorless. And so then the student has to, in essence, bring it to life. And they do that by sort of recognizing that this koan is asking what you're asking, is wanting you to know, what you want to know is speaking to that yearning, but just not in a language that you understand yet. And so can I bring that sense of urgency or that imperative or that yearning into, with some faith, into that work and breathe life into it?

Yeah. You know what? I guess what I've seen is—I mean, with some students, it seems a little easier to get a sense of what might work best for them. And others, sometimes they think, ""Oh, I think this would really suit that person."" And it doesn't necessarily. And also, I think it's good over the course of time to have some experience with these different practices. For instance, for koan students, I think it's good sometimes between collections, I'll have a certain person just do shikantaza for a while, not do koan. Certainly if a koan student is going through a lot, something's going on in their life, there's a lot of turning or turmoil, I'll almost always encourage them to not do the koan and just do the breath or shikantaza, so that they're not using the koan to kind of push aside something that they really need to be allowing to arise. So in that way, there could be some fluidity.

For a person who's really done a more concentrated practice for a long time, to sit shikantaza can be quite a shift in terms of feeling, experiencing the mind more spacious, more open. When they go back to a more directed practice, can they retain some of that spaciousness so that their concentration is too tight, too narrow? Can the koan work help bring some incisiveness, even a sense of inquiry, a subtle sense of inquiry into the shikantaza? So I think there's real value in developing some fluidity.

---

Yeah, Kien, maybe we'll finish off here. You spoke about some of the traps of koan study. Could you speak about traps of shikantaza or pitfalls of it?

Dullness, complacency, just meandering, you know, because there's—and that dullness can be in a quietude, you know, that was Dahui's criticism of the School of Silent Illumination, you know, is that it was just, you know, people were just sitting there like dead things. And without that element of introspection, of inquiry, that's really, I think, what he was concerned about. And so a person can easily sort of drift into that because it's comfortable, feels good, you know, but it's not—it's impermanent because it's based on the meditation in that moment. And it's also not leading to a more fundamental shift. I mean, this is what the Buddha said, you know, that he said that the sila and samadhi and prajna, these three essential elements of training. And he said that samadhi, as important as it is, does not fundamentally free us, right? Because the view, the fundamental identity view, can still be intact. And so to see that that identity is empty, that the skandhas are empty, is ultimately—because then the very notion of clinging, you know, becomes, you know, illusory. So I think those are sort of the main elements—that just dullness and kind of, you know, just getting lost, because there's nothing to gauge your awareness against, right? Which is sort of the value of the object. And a person can be quiet and even quietly drifting and not be fully aware of their state of mind because it feels good. So it's a little easier to get lost. And then, of course, if the mind is active, then the person can just sit there and just think.

So I think it's a good practice at all times, in all days, for all kinds of people. In particular, it's a good practice for somebody who's been practicing for a while and is in a place to do that, and if they're not having a lot of contact with a teacher or any contact, because it's a good practice to maintain on one's own. Whereas, koans, I don't think you can really—I don't see how that can work. You have to really work with a teacher, because how can I guide myself in something that I don't understand? And I can't understand it. I can't understand it because I haven't experienced it. And so I think that the likelihood that I will get tangled up in ideas and false sort of insights is inevitable. And so that's why, you know, that's one factor. It's not determinative, because there are some students who live far away and do fine with the koans, but in general, it's good to have contact.

---

I was just curious about these—like, each koan is different, there's a different dharma point that you're talking about, but it's making contact with ground. So what, like, what is different, I guess, about each?

Well, there, you know, I mean, what do we need—where do we need to be liberated? What do we need to be liberated from? Well, we need to be liberated everywhere and in every situation. We need to be liberated in our thoughts, words, and actions. We need to be liberated in this body. We need to be liberated between ourselves in terms of relating to a world in which there are lots of things, in which there are situations—in other words, everything that a human life encompasses. And so it's not that the koans are, you know, line by line item dealing with every single part of your life. But, you know, I talked a little bit about, you know, language, karma, fundamental teachings, life and death.

There are koans that deal directly with life and death. There are koans that deal with biases—not necessarily the way we would think of them today—but, you know, prejudices, you might say, usually related to the self. So they're—and they deal with phenomena. You know, there are a lot of koans that—a monk asked Master Zhaozhou, ""What is the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from the West? What is the fundamental truth of Buddhadharma?"" And Zhaozhou said, ""An oak tree."" ""That oak tree in the garden."" And the student says, ""Master, don't speak to something that is of a conditioned nature,"" right? Because that's dukkha, to present the fundamental reality. And Zhaozhou said, ""I don't point to the conditioned."" And the student says, ""Well, then, what is the fundamental reality?"" And Zhaozhou said, ""Oak tree in the garden."" And so there, the student is working with, well, what is the nature of phenomenon? An object in the external world, right? If that's empty, how do I realize that? Because I can't experience a tree the way I can experience myself, but I can experience the tree in the way that I experience tree at all, which is in my mind. And if I'm entangled with that object, it's not on the tree, it's in my mind. So if I can liberate that object, that phenomenon in my mind, and realize that it's empty, my perception of it is empty, then I realize that that object is empty, because that's the only way I know it. And then there are other ways that are more through inference of analyzing an object like a tree and realizing that the notion of some unified object that we call a tree doesn't exist anywhere in that object.

Okay, okay, I think that's enough. So the next mando will be—is that you? I think so. Okay. And what are you doing it on? The Teacher-Student Relationship. Sean will be doing a mando next on Teacher-Student Relationship. So let's all be sure to show up for that. Bring your friends.

Okay. So thank you for coming. Are you chanting now? Okay, so Raigetsu will lead us in the four vows.","Geoffrey Shugen Arnold","","","Religion & Spirituality","1:44:17 (approx)","2025 Spring Ango"

Silent and serene, forgetting words, bright clarity appears before you. When you reflect it, you become vast. When you embody it, you are spiritually uplifted, spiritually solitary and shining. Inner illumination restores wonder: dew in the moonlight, a river of stars, snow-covered pines, clouds enveloping the peak. In darkness, it is most bright; while hidden, all the more manifest.

I was here at the temple this week while the sesshin is happening at the monastery—the Apple Blossom Sesshin. And then the week before, I was in hermitage. So I was living in a little cabin on the mountain for a week by myself, solitary, close to the land. Spring waking up. It started the week really cold—snowflakes on my glove. End of the week, it was T-shirt weather. It was crazy.

And I worked with this poem from Hongzhi during the week: ""Guidepost of Silent Illumination."" And it's from the collection *Cultivating the Empty Field*, translated by Taigen Leighton. Beautiful book.

So, I'm a little nervous talking about practice because it's so personal. We get the instructions for zazen—some of you got them for the first time today—and then you're on your own on the cushion. And we're on our own to face our habits, patterns, things we want to get rid of. And we courageously face our minds—maybe past mistakes, regrets—and we let go. That's the instruction.

So I really struggled for many years with what letting go actually meant. It didn't really make anything go away. That's kind of the puzzle, the challenge. But it changes things. It changes our perspective in a radical way. So I want to explore this a little bit more, and I want to bring in and honor that this is Earth Day week also, to try and bring in the Earth. I mean, it's everywhere around us, just popping out. But—so I want to talk about a perspective shift that's somewhat unique to human beings in our time. And it's not unlike the perspective shift that happens deep in stillness and in solitary practice, and that's traveling outside of Earth's orbit.

That experience—which I've not had personally. But even before going to the moon, American astronauts began to prepare by going on high altitude orbits of the Earth. So, in the late '60s, there were people who were selected for their mental stability. These are not people given to reveries. They really wanted people to stay within their rational and mission-based mindsets. So, I'm going to read a little bit from an article I found from *BBC Sky at Night*.

So, on the Apollo 9, which was testing lunar lander modules in Earth's orbit, one of the pilots, Russell Schweickart, finally had the chance to gaze out the window. He looked first for the friendly images, like his home city, which was Houston. He said, you identify with that, it's an attachment. Gradually, with each passage around the world, his attachment widened, and Schweickart found himself identifying with North Africa. By the end of the mission, his sense of connection had come to encompass the whole Earth. And somehow you recognize, he said, that you're a piece of this total life.

So these very rational people were starting to expand their sense of connection after seeing an overview, connecting with home as being vast, enormous, bigger than you could conceptualize, and like a sudden shift. So this ability to identify with the whole, rather than just the sum of the parts, is called the ""overview effect."" This is actually a kind of a thing.

So to me, it felt like what was being described was awe and reverence, that there was a renewed sense. These astronauts coming over, like the edge of a kind of—when they finally traveled to the moon, over the moonscape, which is very rocky and empty and dark, and it looks like all life is absent. To see this fragile blue thing kind of rising—it's called ""Earthrise."" And we've all probably seen that photo. It's kind of iconic: the moon's surface, and then this bright Earth. Stunning.

Hongzhi said, ""Silent and serene, forgetting words. Bright clarity appears before you."" So when we sit, particularly with a consistent, ongoing personal practice, it is a perspective shift that starts to happen.

First, as I mentioned this morning to you in beginning instruction, we're just encountering the noise of our minds, which is pretty noisy. There's a lot going on there. And then as that quiets down, we can encounter our kind of deeper reveries—maybe they're vexations, disappointments, epiphanies, sudden insight that might happen, euphoria, states of bliss. And it is vast. Over time, recognizing that this is endless, this mind, and there's much yet to be known. I think that's one of the perspective shifts that I find most interesting. To me, there's much yet to be known.

So when Hongzhi says ""bright clarity appears before you,"" he is pointing to an experience. Okay, not a thing. It's an experience. And I was kind of trying to describe this to somebody—it's kind of like seeing where a thought had been. Just seeing kind of the possibilities, that it was there and then it's not. And also seeing the capacity, maybe the tendency, the urge to kind of add more thoughts and think about it or congratulate myself, you know, there's like, ""That was so cool. Wow, how do I do that again?""

So, ""forgetting words,"" he said. There's an emphasis in Zen, which we received from Bodhidharma, Bodhidharma's teachings, to not rely on words and letters. That Zen is a special transmission outside of the scriptures, a direct pointing to the human mind. So before there are words, what's there? And this can be also a special kind of frustration, because words are how I communicate—communicate with myself, with you. Letting go of words. What is that?

Whoever's doing—yeah, if you could just shut off your phone, that would be really helpful. Thanks. Unless that's, of course, an insulin monitor. Leave it on, please.

So some of these words, like, there was this redbud tree blooming on Fourth Avenue when I went by last night. If you see it, it's stunning. And it's a flower, right? There's a flower blooming—you know, a flower. Where does that come from? There's words, but the experience of really being with it, that's something else. But the words, oh my gosh, they're so delicious. Like, a flower is a thing, right? It's also coming, you know, a process. It's like flowering. So something coming into being. It's also, you need a flower in order to get a fruit, right? That happens on the apple trees. If all the causes and conditions are right, you get some fruit. That fruit's got its own seeds, more flowers. So there's a proliferation that can happen.

So for a tree, under the right conditions, we get fruit. For zazen practice, under the right conditions, we let go of the words. We come back to the experience: bright and serene. Bright clarity appears before you. When you reflect it, you become vast.

The mind is said to be like a mirror that perfectly reflects everything that comes before it without getting involved in it. So that perfect reflection, in a sense, is seeing the thought in the mind, not adding to it. There's nothing in that mirror but the arising of reality—the thing, the thing outside, the thing in your mind. But it's all clear. It doesn't need to fixate. And it's a process. And that helped me to think about it that way. And over time, with practice and diligence and a bit of resolve, I began to see that and to be more relaxed in it, to not hold my thoughts so tight.

So when there are no obstructions present in the mind, when we don't immediately step back or get whisked into the next thought, there's a moment you might have experienced where your mind becomes very gentle and pliable, resilient and vast. When you reflect it, you are vast. When you embody it, you are spiritually uplifted.

So embodiment is one of the things that we talked about in zazen instructions. How do you put your mind into your body? You know, we use the breath, focus on the breath. We say we put our mind in the hara. Put your mind in your body. That's not fixed either. That's an experience. And it's one we can return to again and again.

You know, dancers, martial artists, probably you know this because you practice it, right? You got to put your mind in your body so that your body is moving, you know, as one entity—probably musicians too. So embodied practice is really what it's all about in zazen.

So each time we return to the cushion, we're starting up again. We're getting grounded in that breath, settling the body. We're on the earth, bringing about those conditions for that clarity and that ease to come about.

It's very important not to be perfectionist about this either, because we are a dynamic being coming into being all the time. And so really accepting what is present really means accepting what's present, even if it's a very tight, distracted, can't-settle-down mind. That's just what's present right now.

So he says, ""When you embody it, you are spiritually uplifted."" And I think that's probably the best description of why really landing in your body can make things easy. Even a new, mysterious ache in your knee or some connection your mind just made that really makes you uncomfortable. Working with kind of holding that what's-arising feeling, even if it's difficult, does help to develop what's called concentration. And we can feel that aliveness as the result of embodying what's happening—the fullness of breath, the fullness of your heart.

In fact, I have noticed that when I really land with stillness, there's actually—there's a relaxing into the fullness of heart that actually is kind of like a heartache. It's actually kind of full. And I've been studying this and trying to understand. I feel like it's because I'm becoming more vulnerable in some ways, that really being in my heart is that opening up the heart, feeling more tender, more vulnerable, and more capable really, of walking a bodhisattva path. And this is also kind of that tipping point where that stillness can start to happen, developing some concentration, trust—trust in the body, and stillness, and stillness in practice.

It also has a name: samatha, I think it's pronounced as. Sometimes translated as cessation. When thoughts gradually slow down and are not being grasped at, they're said to cease. And I want to admit that that actually sounds pretty scary and definitely not what I came to practice for. I did not come to practice to cease. Cessation just sounded very like, ""No, that's not really what I want or what I think this is about.""

So I'm going to step into this text. It's a core Mahayana text called the *Awakening of Faith*. It's attributed to a fellow named Asvaghosha. And I like it because it's somewhat pithy and I keep coming back to it. It's a somewhat technical version of some of the more elaborate Mahayana sutras, like the *Avatamsaka Sutra* or the *Lotus Sutra*, and it reads—with a few notes from me:

What is called cessation means to put a stop to all the characteristics of the world of sense objects and of the mind, because it means to follow the samatha, or tranquility method of meditation—that is, stillness.

And then the corollary part: What is called clear observation—clear, bright clarity—means to perceive distinctly the characteristics of the causally conditioned phenomenon (that's our world, the world of samsara, causally conditioned), because it means to follow the discerning method of meditation—that is, insight. Insight into the nature of emptiness. And emptiness is one of the three marks of existence: emptiness, no self, and nirvana, as Thich Nhat Hanh likes to call it—samsara, nirvana, the world.

So I could read that again:

What is called cessation means to put a stop to all the characteristics of the world of sense objects and the mind because it means to follow the tranquility method of meditation—stillness.

What's called clear observation means to perceive distinctly the characteristics of the causally conditioned phenomenon—that is, the world in which we live—because it means to follow the discerning method of meditation.

And these two are linked: stillness and activity of insight. They're not the same, but they're linked. They're one. And as we follow the breath and develop that stillness, we're developing some concentration and that develops our confidence—I think the confidence that we can turn towards stillness. And as I was saying, landing in your heart, it's a truer expression of that heart, a fuller expression.

And stillness and clear observation are inseparable from wisdom and compassion that arise in our heart. They are spontaneous and effortless, free of the tangles that the thinking mind can create. Clearly being aware of everything—that's how Zen master Sheng Yen translates ""bodhi"" or Buddha mind. He said, when the mind stills to the point where thoughts cease to arise, then body, mind, and universe disappear. This is bodhi. Bodhi is being clearly aware of everything. And that's the kind of awareness that we have in our zazen. Just see it. Not like going after it or not thinking about it—just clearly, just aware.

And that's the same bodhi—Buddha of bodhisattva, the being of bodhi, the person of bodhi—which we chant in the Heart Sutra. And so the bodhisattva lives prajna paramita, with no hindrance in the mind. No hindrance, therefore no fear.

Our minds gain that confidence so we can be bright and clear. Hongzhi says, ""Spiritually solitary and shining. Inner illumination restores wonder. Dew in the moonlight, a river of stars, snow-covered pines, clouds enveloping the peak.""

So what happens when we can rest in zazen? Really rest deeply and feel, really feel deeply. This is the illumination. That is our capacity to really see what's right in front of us. To see that flower, to see that redbud tree, to see the garbage that needs to be swept up from the yard. It's not contrived. It's a genuine seeing. And it can even be as mundane as a cup of coffee and a croissant or somebody offering you a chair, or a public figure standing up against an onslaught of harmful actions—that can be very true, you can feel that. And I feel wonder and awe when I see courage. I feel reverence for the capabilities of an open heart—really feeds my practice.

In darkness, it is most bright; while hidden, all the more manifest. When those who've had the experience of seeing Earthrise over the barren horizon of the moon—the delicacy and brilliant contrast of this bright, turning Earth against the vast expanse of the dark universe—they are seeing, in a sense, all that we are. That bright awareness within a vast mind of changing circumstances.

We will all die someday, which seems inconceivable to this bright awareness. And most of the time, we are woefully unconcerned about its fragility and uncertainty. So, quoting again from this article: Earthrise had a profound effect on Michael Collins as he looked at home—he was one of the early astronauts to land on the moon. In wonderment, suddenly aware of how its uniqueness is stamped on every atom of my body, is what he said. But the effect was short lived. He said, ""I looked away for a moment and then it was gone. I couldn't find it again without searching closely."" Kind of makes sense, right? You have to renew that.

But I don't think it's a stretch to say that we have to renew our stillness so that we can see our bright awareness in this vast space, and so we can touch that inner illumination, that sense of wonder.

So if we fast forward 50 years from that first spacewalk on the moon—and now we have the International Space Station, we have SpaceX, we have any number of plans to go mine the moon and other ways of developing elite colonies and so on. So in this BBC article, Joe Allen is quoted. He's a shuttle pilot for the International Space Station. And he said, ""With all the arguments pro and con for going to the moon, no one suggested we should do it to look at the Earth. But that may in fact be the most important reason.""

So Hongzhi said, ""When wonder exists in serenity, all achievement is forgotten in illumination. What is this wonder? Alertly seeing through confusion is the way of silent illumination and the origin of subtle radiance.""

So during my hermitage, I was a little worried about this talk because I had just found out I was coming down right before the hermitage. So I was trying not to focus on it too much. But I had a dream that I was in a big study hall—maybe it was the temple, I don't know—and I was starting to feel okay, I was calming down a little bit, and then suddenly Hojin Sensei was at the far end and was like, ""We need the dedication! We need it now!"" I was like, ""Oh, the dedication!""

So, to this glorious Earth, our generous Mother, and all of which we receive in thanks, we dedicate all of our efforts to the benefit of all beings. Thank you so much for listening.

37843,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-04-19 12:59","39R","","Zen Center of New York City","A Question Of Practic","","Good afternoon, everyone. Hope you're having a good day.

We kind of move into a different kind of time, don't we? It's not like chronological anymore when you get into Zazenkai. So this spring Ango, we have the theme of mountain training—the Eight Gates of Zen. And I didn’t really know what I wanted to talk about this week, so sometimes I just go to the library and I just look at the shelves and just see what jumps out at me. I picked up this book that I loved reading before called *Buddha* by Karen Armstrong. And so I just started leafing through it. It’s nice and yellow. And, yeah, I just was like, oh, there’s something interesting in here where she’s talking about, does it work? Like, does your practice work? Whatever you’re engaged in, how do you know if it works?

And she said, in any practice... she said that was like the Buddha’s—at the heart of the Buddha’s quest. And his realization was like testing things, practices. He went through a number of them. And does this work in terms of—for him, it was, is this settling his question about why we suffer? That was what he was after. Like, why is there suffering? Who's suffering? What is suffering? Why do we keep suffering?

So I thought I would take a look at that question a little bit more: does this work? It’s a good one to ask ourselves on occasion. And how do we know? And how do we receive answers? Are we looking for a sentence—“This works because…”—and we’re getting analytical? Or what is it? What else is operating?

You know, Daido Roshi gave us these Eight Gates, which is his recasting, in a way, of the Eightfold Path of the Buddha. But he says, these are gates we enter, but there are actually no gates. There aren’t gates. It’s just one body, one mind. And we look at these aspects of ourself that we develop as a person: our creative beingness, our intellect, our body, our relationships, our morality. And so we have these particular areas of focus where we can experience the richness of our life through them and see how they're all interrelated. And it’s all what we call our life. It’s just our life.

And how many gates do we enter here today through this Zazenkai? Probably all of them. We touch on all of them: student-teacher relationship, liturgy, moral and ethical teachings, creative expression, the miracle of aliveness of the body, the study of the Dharma, right action. And often students come—and I did myself—wondering to my teachers, is this working? And they would say, you tell me. You tell me, where do you find yourself?

So why are we in the Sendo? Why are you in the Sendo? Why am I in the Sendo? I think it’s important to keep looking at and re-feeling into, and not look for linear answers, but allow for something we don’t know about, something larger to open, that we wonder about. And I think it’s good to keep checking, because we can get lost in that initial impulse. It can become muddy. Some of us start and we’re suffering greatly, and then that shifts a bit after we start practicing. And then why do we continue? So what is that? The essence of why we turned in the first place? Sometimes it gets lost in form. We lose that connection. We get lost in form, or we’re dependent on something external that’s holding us.

And sometimes we start practicing for one reason, and we may still be clinging to that old way through habit, just like we cling to relationships in the past or to jobs after things have passed their time and they no longer fulfill what they used to fulfill. So we have to keep checking in again on that spark, because everything keeps shifting and changing. So to ask from time to time, why am I doing this?—could be helpful.

And it’s important to remember that we’re here by choice. Nobody put us in a straitjacket and said, you’re coming to Zazenkai today. We weren’t airlifted in. We came by choice, right? You knew it was going to be sunny today. So it’s important to recognize we’re here by ourselves. That’s good to recognize. And we begin practice by a choice. Even though we might seem like we had no choice, we made a choice that we had no choice. We’re not here because of our parents—not really—or our heritage, because of institutions. Or maybe you are. Is that working?

And we always begin in a kind of an inquiry, right? I wonder what it’s like if I go to a Sunday service. I wonder what it’s like at this temple. Why am I going? Somebody introduced me. That’s why I went. Really? Is that what was happening? Maybe we’re just curious. Sometimes, for some of us, the fruits of our inquiry will be of no interest. And if they do interest us, then we’ll start to explore. We’ll start to explore and to see what the exploration brings up.

So in a sense, we’re all on an expedition together. And Shugen used to always refer to Ango as like, this big ship goes out when we start Ango. And I always saw, like, this big expedition. We were all going out on this ship together. And then if that exploration is sustained, we kind of make a commitment. Uh oh, commitment—the “C” word. But that’s necessary in a deep exploration.

You know, I think it was Kornfield. He wrote that book *Path with a Heart*. On the back it says *Path without a Heart*—there was a misprint. It was interesting. And he wrote something like, you know, we can dig a lot of holes, but eventually we have to dig a deep hole, otherwise we just get a lot of holes.

So I picked up this book by Karen Armstrong. It’s really clear. I love her style of writing, a lot of clarity. But she does—she brings out this question of does it work? And how that finally led to Buddha’s realization, experience. And so I want to read a few sentences from it.

She says, “A person’s theology was a matter of total indifference to the Buddha. To accept a doctrine on somebody else’s authority was, in his eyes, an unskillful state which could not lead to enlightenment, because it was an abdication of personal responsibility. He saw no virtue to submitting to an official creed. Faith meant trust that nirvana, or peace, existed, and a determination to prove it to oneself—that I could be at peace, and to prove that to myself. The Buddha always insisted that his disciples test everything he taught them against their own experience, and take nothing on hearsay. A religious idea could all too easily become a mental idol—one more thing to cling to—when the purpose of the Dharma was to help people to let go. Even his own teachings must be jettisoned once they have done their job.”

There’s that koan that says, “If you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha,” which is referring to that, you know, don’t put a head on top of the one that you have. Yours is fine.

So he keeps making the point over: does it work? Not do I believe it? Am I doing it right? Am I better than—does it work for me? Does this work for me? That’s all Shakyamuni Buddha is interested in. And maybe what we should be interested in: does it work? And the pragmatic basis of our exploration is, does it work?

So explorers knew that if they saw something, they had to continue their exploration. When we get a glimpse of something we’ve never seen before, how do we then in practice know to continue? We know it’s necessary to continue, perhaps, because when we see something with our ears or hear with our eyes and we have an insight, when we realize something we have never realized or seen before is brought to light, and we realize by being aware.

Awareness is the tool of our attention. I think attention and awareness are interchangeable, and that makes us uniquely human—that we can be aware.

There’s an old Zen story, and it came up three times this week, so I thought I should say it. Three times I heard this story by other people and I read it. A student asked Master Ichu, “Please write me something of great wisdom.” Master Ichu picked up a brush and wrote one word: “Attention.” The student said, “Is that all?” The master wrote, “Attention. Attention.” The student became irritable. “That doesn’t seem very profound or subtle to me.” In response, Master Ichu wrote simply, “Attention, Attention, Attention.” In frustration, the student demanded, “What does the word attention mean?” And Master Ichu replied, “Attention means attention.”

And like this student, we might find this is really disappointing, that that’s the answer we get—so dry and uninteresting. Attention. What’s the most important, the greatest wisdom? Attention. “But isn’t there something else?” “Attention.” It’s like—I thought of Mae West, where she sings, “Is that all there is? Is that all there is? Let’s keep on dancing.”

Yet without attention, there really isn’t practice. We have to see. We have to get insight into what’s happening. So we have to have attention, not tension. Attention and awareness is the makeup of our present experience. It’s what’s going on now. What’s going on now? What are you aware of? Might we know? That’s how our practice is working.

What I was thinking of was, many students will come—and I’ve done this with my teacher—and I’ll go through, like, “My mind is so busy, and I snapped at this person, and I can’t believe how angry I got. And I don’t know if this is working.” And I remember Daido Roshi saying, “Oh, that’s a lot that you’ve seen, that you’re attentive to what’s not working. How many people see that?” See, that’s what’s actually happening with us. And we just brush that off like it’s just nothing. We can’t do anything unless we see something like that; otherwise it just goes on autopilot. But when we see it and we feel like something is happening with that, then we can shift, we can look into it further.

Like, if we’re confused, seeing confusion with awareness. We can see that if we’re confused, then there must be something that’s not confused because we see we’re confused. That’s wisdom. But we brush that aside. So we say, “I’m confused. Something hasn’t come through yet.” We have to be patient. It just means we don’t see something yet. But what we do see is confusion. That’s attentive. I know you’re all like, what the heck? Experiential awareness. That’s how we prove it to ourselves.

Am I able to see this person or this situation in a broader way? Am I able to sit with confusion arising? Am I able to move through this crisis with more calmness? Am I able to look at the news and the things that are happening and stay present? Am I able to open more to owning the dark side, the more shadowy sides of myself as it arises in zazen or in my life—my compulsions, my cravings, needs, my bad feelings? Can I be there? Can I be attentive to that, just seeing it arise? Am I present to this now? Is there letting, non-grasping? Is my universe expanding or shrinking? Am I able to face suffering? Is this happening to some measure or not?

Are you who you were a couple years ago? Think of something that really, like, bothered you. It may still, but sometimes there are certain things that was unbearable a couple years ago, and now we’re like, what was that? What was that? What happened? How come it’s different now? Is it working? And does it work?

I don’t think we can go to the mind for our answers—not all of them. And I remember this quote that I’ve remembered for years—I’ve loved it—which is: To go to the mind to find the answer to the question, “Does Zen work?” is like asking a corrupt police department to investigate itself. Can’t be done.

So we have to go to something else besides the mind. Sometimes because it’s corrupt, it doesn’t always give us the correct answer, but only not-mind does. Sometimes our not-knowing does—this inner sense, our inner connection knows if it works. Yeah.

So we have to expand that not-knowing or uncertainty of what’s happening. And there’s a lot of fear around uncertainty. So much, because uncertainty is the loss of what’s comfortable, familiar, the known. The self that we call “I” is made up of mostly knowns. So this is taking us to unknowns. It’s mostly made up of fixed points of certainty. That’s why I continually try to prop myself up: I’m okay. Tell me I’m okay. Tell me I’m doing okay. Tell me I’m right, you’re wrong, so I can be right. Clinging to identities, titles, possessions, people, religions, ideals—all propping this up to something that’s fixed, settled, dependable. At least I can depend upon it.

And Zazenkai or sesshin, at the deepest level, is an advance by choice into that not-known. By choice, we’re sitting into not being certain, into unknown. But all the knowns come up: I’m this, they’re that. We cycle through all the knowns, and we just want to release it. The experience of no road ahead, no fixed point, no dependable map, no destined end, no result. It’s hard. I just sit there sometimes, and I feel my mind just go into that—like it’s like a Pac-Man: What about—? I’m like, settle down, settle down. You’re right here. You don’t have to go over there.

The practice of all-day sitting is the constant choice of returning to the experience of not-known, not-fixed. Instead of running to the familiar, it’s the experience of not, not. So we have to expand that not-mind.

Somebody wrote a book once called *It’s Figureoutable*. I thought that was really a funny title. I didn’t go into it. But we’re constantly trying to figure out most everything, constantly try to grasp at our mind, use outer sources as a yardstick. So not-mind is zazen: unknown, unfixed. It’s not the Buddha, it’s not the Dharma, it’s not the teacher, it’s not this Dharma talk, it’s not the Sangha. It’s not anything at all. It’s our individual practice of not-mind, of not-known, and our commitment to seeing this as urgent, as the most important thing.

We need teaching for sure, but we do confuse the finger that’s pointing to the moon. But we need to find out about the path, the teachings that remove confusion. That’s necessary. We need to be analytical sometimes for sure. These aren’t absolutes. We need the Sangha. We need these practices to keep going, to keep us from falling into delusion, to ignorance. But I don’t know—ultimately, they may be secondary. It’s just zazen, just sitting, where we can combust our lives. And we do our best to bring the body along.

But our deepest, most honest self knows what we must do, that we can identify a coasting zazen and then re-enter a deep, committed, on-the-edge—wherever we are—zazen. And we know, not knowing, we’re aware. Then we can really answer, does this work? And with great care, keep letting go of the ideas, the ideations, the projections, what we want to look like. That’s mind.

So it must arise out of our self, our body. And when it does, we will know, and we won’t have to believe.

So I’ll close with another piece from her book where she says:

“The Dharma is essentially a method, and it stands or falls not by its metaphysicality or acuity or its scientific accuracy, but by the extent to which it works. The truths claim to bring suffering to an end, but not because people subscribe to a salvific creed or to certain beliefs. Rather, because they enter the Buddha’s way of life. Over the centuries, people have indeed found that this path has brought them a measure of peace and insight. They have realized that by reaching beyond themselves to a reality that transcends their rational understanding, one becomes fully human. For the Buddha, that was a fact. For him, it worked.”

What if we simply stayed with any moment of recognition? We wake up from a thought and there’s just this recognition of our present situation, just where we are. We just come out of the thought and we just recognize just this unknown sitting here. What if we rest with that? What if we allow our confusion to trigger wisdom, to allow anything that we encounter be an invitation to wisdom?

Does that work for you?

This is from the Blue Cliff Record: Huang Po's Gobblers of Dregs.

The pointer: The great capacity of Buddhist ancestors is completely within their control. The lifeline of humans and gods is entirely subject to their direction. With a casual word or phrase, they astound the crowd and stir the masses. With one device, one object, they smash chains and knock off fetters. Meeting transcendental potential, they bring up transcendental matters. But tell me, who has ever come on like this? Are there any who know where they are? At the test? I cite this. Look.

One day, Huang Po, instructing the Sangha, said, “All of you people are drunk, gobblers of dregs. If you go on traveling around this way, where will you have today? Do you know that there are no teachers of Chan in all of China?” At that time, a student came forward and said, “Then what about all those in various places who order followers and lead communities?” Huang Po said, “I don't say there's no Chan, it's just that there are no teachers.”

Verse: His cold and severe, solitary mien does not take pride in itself. Solemnly dwelling in the sea of the world, he distinguishes dragons and snakes. Ta Chung, the Son of Heaven, has been lightly handled three times. He personally felt those claws and fangs at work.

Good morning. As many of you know, this ango, our theme is the Eight Gates. And when I was thinking about this ango, our 45th anniversary, I thought about Daido Roshi and his establishing of the monastery. And very early on, Sangha practicing here in the city, originally in Manhattan, and building a community of practitioners and developing what he called the Eight Gates, was really drawing from traditional practices in Zen and largely in Buddhism.

And I really appreciate that he brought them out in the way of making these sort of establishes in a very conscious way as sort of the vehicle by which we take up Buddha Dharma. That both brings them into our consciousness, sort of holds them up for us to see and helps us. And really, I think an important part of his intention was that we would examine them, that we would not just do what people had done before, but we would do that with some measure of faith. But we would also be examining this particular form of practice. Why is this important? What is the doorway that this opens, so that in that way, they become alive, right?

In order for the Dharma to be alive in every generation, it's not in a book, it's not in a sutra, it's not even in a building or temple, but it's in people. And so I wanted to this morning speak a little bit about the gate of training that he called Zen study, which is studying with a teacher.

In the Uttara Tantra Sutra, which is a Mahayana Sutra, Buddha Nature Sutra, it says: “The perfect Buddha Kaya”—and kaya means body, vehicle—so, Buddha body—“the perfect Buddha Kaya is all-embracing. Suchness cannot be differentiated, and all beings have the disposition; thus, they always have Buddha nature. The Buddha has said that all beings have Buddha nature, since Buddha wisdom is always present within the assembly of beings, since this undefiled nature is free from duality, and since the disposition to Buddhahood has been named after its fruit.”

So it's expressing what the Buddha realizes in his enlightenment: that we all have Buddha nature, which is this fundamentally enlightened mind. And all the qualities of a Buddha, of an enlightened being—great compassion, generosity, patience, selflessness, wisdom—it's all-embracing. It's all throughout the body and mind. It's all throughout every single person. Suchness, which is the perfect manifestation of your original nature, which is always present, never absent, which is ultimately what we are practicing to realize, cannot be differentiated. It's not of the discriminating mind. It's not high or low. It's not in the world of gain and loss. It can't be possessed or purchased or lost. And every being has the disposition.

What disposition? Buddhism teaches that because all of us naturally, instinctively turn away from what is painful and move towards what is pleasant and affirming, that we have the disposition to move towards enlightenment—an ultimate kind of pleasure, you could say, an ultimate freedom from every form of displeasure and pain and confusion. Well, then why aren't we all living like that? Right? It's a basic question.

In a sense, every tradition—I don't know about every tradition, but it seems like the great world religions all possess some sense that we have lost our way from something. Cast out of the garden, separated from God, alienated from nature, blind to our Buddha nature. And so in that sense, every tradition has some sense of returning, right? We're trying to find our way back to something. And what Buddha realized in enlightenment is you can't find your way back because you've never actually been apart from it. Thus, everyone has Buddha nature because Buddhism is always present within you. Your basic nature is free of duality and you have the disposition.

And yet we struggle with our attachments. We get deceived by our false views and the false views of others. And as practitioners, this is our practice: to see this, to begin to see this. Right. To come into practice means we have to have some sense of that. Nobody comes here because you're having such an incredible and amazing life and time and are utterly undisturbed by the world. In a sense, we come here because there is the awareness that there is a problem. But moreover, you are acting in response to that. You are not just defeated or not just deciding, “Well, that's just the way it is. Nothing to be done.” We seek.

And so when we begin practicing, we turn towards that very thing that we're trying to, in a sense, escape from, and see it more closely, more clearly. In a way, it becomes more painful. But is it? Is it more painful when you're actually engaged in a path that understands and is guiding you and you're the guide and that can help us to also understand and how difficult that is, right?

And Buddhism doesn't mince words about that. Buddhism lays it out: this is a difficult path. Not because it is difficult. Sometimes people say, “Why did you make it so difficult?” We're what's difficult. Human beings are complicated, deluded, attachment—attaching minds is what's difficult. The Dharma, it's not difficult. And that can help us. This is one of the ways we cultivate compassion, is when we see this in ourselves as we are practicing to free ourselves. And then we look out and see all the people who don't have the opportunity or the inclination or don't give a shit about trying to actually bring benefit into the world, do something good, liberate themselves, liberate others. Then we understand the challenge of samsara.

And what the Buddha realized was that we all have a sense of our self, right? I am here talking to you, and I can talk to you. And in a moment, in different moments, I can be self-aware that I am doing that, right? When I was performing music, there were often moments where I'd be performing and I would just be in the music. And then another moment where I would step outside and be aware that I was performing, and things would start to come apart. And so I had to come back, come back inside. And so we can have that sense. You can have the sense that you are sitting here listening, and in one moment you're just listening, another moment, you're aware that you're listening.

So we have self-awareness. That's just part of the way our mind functions, our brain works. But Buddhism says that where that becomes problematic is when we impute into that a sense that because I am self-aware, there must be someone that is there at the center of that awareness. It's me, it's myself, it's the self. And the Buddha said that the delusion can be sort of come down to just the sense that this is me and this is mine—what I possess, what belongs to me, what is me, my identity. And the Buddha said that is the source of all of the madness that we see in the world, small and large. There is no pain and suffering without a self that arises and acts out of that sense of self and creates harm. There can be no harm without that. There can be no dukkha, there can be no suffering. And so that's what practice brings our attention to—to free ourselves of that. Not the sense of it, that's not the problem. It's the attachment to it, the imputing into that a kind of reality that it doesn't actually exist.

Bakubodi said that we all have a sense of self, but it's kind of vague and amorphous. You know, it's not like you can't, if you were to go looking for it, you couldn't actually find it. But because there's a kind of anxiety, because it's not quite clear, we have to fill it with content, fill it up, right? And so we go looking for things to fill that sense of self up. Like, who am I? What do I think? What do I do? What do I own? My content. And then, of course, if you have content, you need to protect it. You don't want somebody to take it, and you might want it to be better than the next one, and you can always add more. And so this self is like trying to make a fabric whole.

And the Buddha said, you will never succeed—not at creating a self, we all actually succeed at that—or creating a false sense of self. But we will never succeed in fulfilling our disposition. We'll never actually find true happiness, true fulfillment, true contentment. We'll get moments of it, yeah, moments. That's what keeps us going in samsara, those little sweet moments of happiness, of joy, of pleasure, of meaning. But then they go—gone, gone, gone, gone. And so we have to keep going back to the trough to feed, to find. The Buddha said that will never end. It will never end until we introduce something that shifts, interrupts, breaks the cycle, which is often the beginning of the search.

But if everybody has the Buddha nature, has Buddha nature—in other words, you have whatever you're seeking—the Buddha said, you already have that. That doesn't mean you have a sufficient place to live and food on the table, and you know, all of that, but you have, in a spiritual sense, what you are ultimately seeking in order to feel, to experience your life as a Buddha.

And so then, what's the role of a teacher? Dogen quotes an old master who said, “If you want to attain the matter of suchness, your original face, your original perfection, your completeness, your Buddha nature, you must be a person of suchness. If you want to attain this, you have to be a person of suchness.” You already are a person of suchness, so why worry about it then? Dogen says, in other words, those who think that they would like to attain the matter of suchness, to realize themselves, to free themselves, must themselves be such a person. In other words, you can't get it from somewhere else. It's not a thing. The good news is you're not absent of that which you seek. You are already that, have that which you are seeking. So don't worry about it.

Are we done? Not quite. We doubt, we're not so sure. Maybe everybody else, but I don't think me. We're insecure. Every attachment has insecurity. Why else would we attach?

So Huang Po was a really well-known teacher. He was a teacher of Linji, a very important teacher within the Zen tradition, Chan tradition of China. And so one day he says, “All of you people are gobblers of dregs.” We're all just looking for the sediment at the bottom, right? Meanwhile, there's all this exquisite wine or apple cider or whatever tickles your fancy, but we're gobblers of dregs. He said, “If you go on traveling around like this, where will you ever find today? Where will you have today?” He says, “Don't you know that there are no teachers of Chan in all of China?” And this is at the height of Chan: monasteries, teachers, sanghas in all quarters. And so a monk steps forward and says, “Well, wait a minute, what about all those teachers who are teaching in all these various places and leading communities?” And Huang Po said, “I didn't say there's no Chan, I just said there are no Zen teachers.”

Now remember that the nature of the koan is always pointing at the fundamental thing. And so we can look at this and say, well, you know, I get it. Like, you know, I have Buddha nature. You can't give that to me. So I have to realize that within myself. True. Is my life changed by knowing that? No. So that makes it clear that that's not what this koan is pointing to. Just coming to an ordinary, even if true, understanding that doesn’t really change anything fundamentally is not the point of the koan. Koan is about changing something at the fundamental, in a sense, meeting that disposition, meeting your seeking mind, and helping you to leap free into your suchness.

Huang Po, in saying this, at the very moment he's saying this, is a Zen teacher leading a community, right? Nurturing disciples, leading a Sangha. That's true. But again, if we only look at it that way, then nothing changes for us. If the students at that time only saw it that way, then they would never free themselves.

When I was thinking about this morning, working on the talk, I was remembering that when Daido Roshi, when we were doing a lot of wilderness retreats and he was basically leading, he was our guide. He would, as we were developing skills and going out and doing all kinds of things, he would say, “Look, it's important to trust your guide, but you should be prepared to get lost and be able to find your way.” In other words, don't rely on the guide in such a way that if you somehow did get lost, you'd be bereft of capacity. Don't abdicate responsibility, he would say, because otherwise we're not learning something. We're just following somebody.

And so in the pointer where it says “meeting the transcendental potential,” Huang Po is clear on this, on his own transcendental potential, and he sees all of that potential in everyone he meets. But he wants his students to be clear on it. He wants them to realize their transcendental potential, their Buddha nature.

I was also, as I was reflecting on this pointer this morning, “the great capacity of Buddhas and ancestors is completely within their control.” He's really praising Huang Po in this case. “The lifeline of humans and gods is entirely subject to their direction. With a casual word or phrase, he astounds the crowd and stirs the masses, smashes chains, and knocks off fetters.”

And Buddhism in all traditions, particularly in the Mahayana tradition, has a lot of this language which is very poetic. It's very creative, it's very aspirational, right? I mean, you know, if you said, “Look, you may or may not find some morsel of happiness, I'm not sure. Don't get your hopes up,” you know, so it's aspirational. It's aiming high. As Dogen says, aim high because you're a Buddha.

And so we have to learn. How do you do that? How do I have that? How do I have that measure of trust in myself and the Dharma, but not turn that into a fixed notion, an idea, an expectation, right, to which I am always failing? An aspiration isn't like that. It has no end. It's spacious. I'm not forming a fixed idea in my mind of it. When where it's aspirational, very different. But so we have to—how do you hold that and not turn it into something solidified, which then leads to discouragement and frustration?

But another aspect I was thinking of, this pointing is that can it seem to suggest that as a bodhisattva, for practitioners and enlightened being, you're in complete control of everything? Right? It seems to suggest that. That's not what it's saying. Part of the living with and in samsara is meeting squarely and honestly all that we are not in control of. I mean, just sit down and have no thought for 30 minutes. I mean, come on, you can practice that, but you are not in control of your mind, nor do you want to try and practice in that way. Otherwise you'll just become like a tight vise and you will still have thoughts.

And so I think it's really important in that sense of aspiration. We chant our vows to alleviate all suffering, and then we wake up every day in a world in which suffering abounds. And I cannot stop it. I cannot just smash those chains and knock off those fetters everywhere I see them. I can't do that. I don't have that power. And so it's important that we not misunderstand the teachings. But at the same time, they're really pointing at what I can do within myself. Can I deal with my own chains and fetters? In doing that, can I learn a great deal about your chains and fetters—you being everyone, anyone? Can I understand how we tie ourselves up into knots, create a very clear logic within our delusion that makes our very harm-creating actions, our very selfish actions, logical? Can it help us to understand how we can shut down our humanity within ourselves, become dead to that at the same time that we might be becoming wildly successful in the world? And so that when I inflict that deadness upon others, it doesn't matter, I don't feel it, I don't care. It helps us to understand that.

It doesn't, in a way, take the pain away. It's, in a way, even more heartbreaking. Because part of what we're realizing as we practice is it doesn't have to be like that—and not in some utopic fantasy world, but now, in this lifetime, in this human body and mind, we are practicing to realize suchness.

Who gives us the audacity? Who gave you the audacity to think you could do that? It's kind of audacious, right? You need some audacity to do this. But what's the basis of that? You have Buddha nature. You have the disposition that such that on some level, I'm guessing that when you encounter the dharma, even if you're here for the first time, something spoke to you. If it didn't, why would you be here? You know, whenever I—like at the monastery, when a young person comes to do a retreat, you know, they might be still a teenager and they're with their parent and I'm introducing them, I say, “Did you want to come to be here?” Right. Because that's important. Like, you should want to be here, right? Because we have Buddha nature. That's how Buddhism sees it. And it's a truth. It's just a basic truth. It's not because you did something special. Everyone has it.

And so going back to just how do we hear these teachings? Because otherwise, I was saying to somebody this morning, when my teacher would say, “You are responsible.” He would say, “You are responsible for the whole catastrophe.” And I would think, “Oh, my God, I just don't know. How can that be?” Because I heard it as, my responsibility is to make all of this right. And so I thought, “I'm just failing.” That isn't what he was saying. Of course that wasn't what he was saying. Well, what was he saying? What am I responsible for?

There's a koan where Huike, the second Chinese ancestor, came to Bodhidharma and said, “My mind is not at peace.” He was in an inner torment. He was in turmoil. He was seeking. He wanted to be free of that. And he had the sense that it was possible. So he came to this teacher, and he said, “Please, set my mind at peace.” He believed that his teacher could maybe do that for him, give him something that would bring that about. And Bodhidharma said, “Okay, that mind that is in turmoil, bring it to me. I'll set it at peace for you. Bring it to me.” And Huike went and searched and searched and searched. He wanted nothing more than to be able to bring that mind to Bodhidharma. He was feeling it. He was experiencing, seemed to be something. And he came back and he said, “I've searched and I've searched, I cannot find it.” And his teacher said, “There, I've set it at rest for you.”

From an ordinary point of view, in terms of studying with a teacher, I can think, well, there's something I don't have, otherwise I would not see the world, be in this body and mind in this way. The teacher seems to have it. Can you give it to me? Right. So that's sort of a—most students would never admit to that, right? But secretly, secretly, you know, we haven't given up. Teacher's going to save us. So we find out that, okay, that's just not true. That's not going to happen. But then we can look at it as, well, I have Buddha nature, so what do I need a teacher for? I'm going to have to do this for myself. True. There's nothing a teacher can give me. Kind of true. Just meditate. The Buddha did that. Sometimes people say he didn't have a teacher. He certainly did have teachers. He had teachers, he studied with them. But he also sort of came to the point that they came to and realized, “I'm not yet liberated.” They seemed to be satisfied with something that he was not yet. Thank you for that.

I remember many times, particularly in the early years, especially in the early years, where I'd be struggling with something and I would think, you know, I should take this in to my teacher. And I thought, but, you know, I have to resolve this. So I wouldn't bring it up to my teacher. It was true that I needed to resolve this, but I wasn't even giving my teacher a chance to help me. I wasn't understanding something. And after a while, I thought, “Why isn't he helping me?” And then I thought, “Oh.”

And so what is the situation? We begin to recognize what the Buddha called dukkha. Everything, everything has the capacity to lead to discontent, disappointment, dissatisfaction because of our attachments. Ultimately, because there is some sense of a self lacking something, needing something, something outside. We seek. We hear the teachings. We learn how to do meditation. For those of you who learned how to do meditation this morning, congratulations.

When we first learn meditation, if we, I would say, become a serious practitioner, there's really no way we can understand at that moment what has just been communicated, because it's just information. We're learning how to meditate. Meditate. It's sort of out there in the ethos, in the ether, right? People meditate, they're meditating. In Buddhism, meditation is very specific. It has very particular understandings of what constitutes meditation in Buddhism. Why are we doing this? How do we do it? It's not something just in the abstract. It's integral to the whole purpose of the path of Buddhadharma, which is to liberate the body and mind of self and other. And so if we keep practicing, we will begin to understand bit by bit what we encountered in that first moment.

It's sort of like when you're born, you know, you start walking, you know, toddler, you fall, you hang on to stuff. You know, a toddler's not thinking about, “Oh, my God, the implications of this.” They're just trying to stay upright, right? Because it's crazy. Like, who stands on two legs, right? We have no sense of the possibility of this, right? How do we meet all that we experience? How do we meet it? That's the key. If we meet it in the same way we've met everything in our life, then the same thing keeps happening. The Buddha said there's an impulse to shut it down. No. And there are a hundred different ways of saying no, or just grab on and ride with it. There are 10,000 different ways of holding on. He said, there's a middle way. There's a middle way that avoids both of those extremes. It's not an idea, it's not an answer, a question you're just going to answer and then you've got it. It's not a formula. It's a living thing.

The teacher is a mirror to mirror the student back to themselves. Because it's, you know, we're just so used to ourselves. You've been living in your body and mind since the beginning. It's very difficult to see ourselves with any kind of objectivity. We're too invested. And so part of what the teacher does is they mirror. They just mirror back.

I remember years ago, there was a student at the monastery who had a lot of anger. And, you know, there were reasons she had a lot of anger. And one night she went into dokusan—it was just the residents, it was just us in the zendo—and suddenly we hear, “I'm angry. I'm so angry. I'm really angry.” It went on and on. And then there was a pause. And then her teacher responded, “Me too.” Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. That was it. And I thought, did she see? Did she see what he was offering to her?

It's important that the teacher doesn't need anything from the student. What does that mean? If the teacher needs something from the student, they're already in trouble. The teacher naturally wants the student to be free. As a teacher in our lineage, we take vows to teach, to offer any kind of medicine to anybody. And if it's a Dharma student, then it's the Dharma.

That's one of the reasons the Guardian Council has been set up. Daido Roshi spoke about this years ago. He said, the teacher, if somebody comes and asks for the teaching, the teacher has a vow to say yes. But sometimes the student may not be ready for that commitment, or they may not be looking in the right place. This medicine may not be the medicine they need.

And so he said, the Guardian Council needs to be set up. He said, because I can't say no. But sometimes that person may need to be redirected to something that will actually be helpful to them. This may not be that thing for them, or it may not be time yet. They may need some more study or some more experience or something. And so part of the role of the Guardian Council is to be able to be that, right? It's interesting. It's important. The student can come and go. They can practice or not practice. But the teacher doesn't turn away from the student. That's their commitment. Their vow is to do all that they can to bring wisdom to help the student discover their own wisdom, to help the student realize their own great compassion. They can't do that for the student.

The Buddha was very clear. He said, I can offer these teachings, basically report from within my own experience of what I have seen to be true and what I learned through my own path. I can offer that to you. And so he said, a teacher should be not tight-fisted, which means, don't hold that back, be generous. But he said, having offered that, now you must go. And isn't that what we do for those of you who came here this morning? You come in, so nice to see you. Thank you for coming. We give you beginning instruction and then we take you, you're shown your seat. Now it's you. You take that seat. You're the Buddha. You're the one who has the disposition. You're the one who brought yourself here. And because it's something we can only do ourselves, how wonderful that we do that together.

A student can bring all kinds of questions to a teacher: relationships, family, work, the world. And the teacher is a teacher of the Dharma. They're not a job coach, a relationship coach, a therapist. Some teachers are therapists and are therapists and teachers to their students. There's mixed views on that, just so you know. Personally, I don't think that's a great idea. But the teacher will respond to whatever the student brings, in my experience and from my own perspective from within the Dharma.

I remember years ago, a student had just received jukai. It was a student who was a physician and worked in a pediatric ICU. Very soon after that, they called Daido Roshi in the middle of the night and said, “Look, I've got this child here. They're basically brain dead. They have no possibility. The parents want me to remove the life support system. I just took a vow to affirm life and not kill. What do I do?” And Daido Roshi said, “You received the precepts. They're yours. I can't answer this question for you. You're the one; take that responsibility.” And so the teacher is trying to bring the student to the Dharma so they themselves can see how to bring that into this relationship, this work situation, this family, this world.

The Dharma does not give you answers. It doesn't say, “Okay, in this particular crisis that we're in right now, go to page 25. Follow the rules.” Right? There's no cookbook, or you're the cookbook. That's the deal. The Dharma helps us understand the nature of the self and how things work at the deepest level. And helps us to open our heart so that the pain that we experience in the world is painful. And also that we develop this very deep and essential capacity to unbind so that we can allow that pain to come in, but not take it on. It'll kill you, right? It'll overwhelm you. And for every honest practitioner, there are moments of overwhelm. There are moments where you just feel overwhelmed. That's honest. That's honest. But that's just a moment. Recognize that. Don't set up house there.

The teacher will disappoint you. Just telling you up front. What does that mean? Because the student will have some expectations. Some of them are quite reasonable. There's a role that the student has. There's a role that the teacher has. We should respectively know what those are. The student has a responsibility in training. The teacher has a responsibility. The teacher has a greater responsibility. I think of it as a sacred trust. But the teacher will not fulfill your dreams and all of your expectations. But they should never betray your trust. If they do, that can be repaired. But the teacher has to be supremely committed to that, right? Because trust broken is harder to be regained. And so that's why I think of it as a sacred trust. It has to have resilience and strength and stability, but also to understand in a way, it can be fragile.

In the commentary, it says, “The essence of this school that has come down from ancient times is sometimes holding on, sometimes letting go, sometimes killing, sometimes giving life, sometimes releasing, sometimes gathering up, sometimes being gentle, sometimes being fierce, sometimes affirming, sometimes negating, not fixed. Skillful means.” Means skillful for this person in this moment. Towards what end? Relinquishing attachments, illuminating false views.

I remember Daido Roshi one time telling me that a student had come in to dokusan and said, “I really want you to push me, take me to the limit, take me to my edge. I really want to free myself.” And so he did, and they crumbled. And I said, “So what? So what about that?” He says, “Well, they're showing me.” He says, “They say they want something, but then they're showing me what their capacity is at this moment, what they're actually ready for, or what their actual level of trust is.” He said, “That's more important than their words.” He said, “In a sense, I have to teach to that. I can't ignore that.” And so, in a sense, the teacher is always trying to meet the present capacity of the student. And then more.

It's like when my mother was teaching me to swim, and we got in the water and she said, “Okay, I've got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich right here. It's waiting for you. You gotta come get it, right? You gotta come get it.” And I would swim and I'd swim. And then she started stepping back. I was like, wait a minute. But then she would stop and she'd catch me, right? Stretching, expanding, extending, so that I could see that my limit was not this, it was larger.

All of this is so that we can see for ourselves what the Buddha realized. You have the disposition, your very nature is non-dual, is already free, is already peaceful, and there are a few things that we have to attend to. Suzuki Roshi said, “You're perfect and complete and could use a little work.” But when we do that work, to speak of it that way, from that understanding of faith in Buddha nature, then what we see that is holding us back is not your nemesis, it's not your enemy, it's not a failure.

Bodhidharma said, “When you meet adversity, don't be surprised.” It makes sense. When we really understand karma, the nature of the mind, then when we experience those things within ourselves, it makes sense. I understand this. I understand why this is arising and why it's so strong, right? And it helps to not take it so personally, right? It's not you. It's just an emotion. It's not you. It's just a thought. It's not you. It's just a memory. It's not you. But it is your responsibility, because there it is. And you can strengthen that and act on it. And that's not going to go so well. Or there is shift.

So the teacher can only point. The student has to step forward. Dogen says, if we don't step forward, we can't encounter the Dharma. But stepping forward just happens in this moment, and then this moment, and then this moment. Years ago, we were on a camping trip, and a student was telling us a story of being at a talk by the Dalai Lama. And he was talking about the suffering and the work, and he just got overwhelmed and started sobbing. And she was like, “Even the Dalai Lama.” And then she stopped talking. And I said, “Well, wait a minute. But what happened?” It was like that was the end of the story. I said, “No, what happened next?” And she said—and I wasn't there, but I knew—and she said, “He paused, and then he kept on going with the talk.” I said, “Exactly. He stepped forward.” Yes, he was free enough to be able to be overwhelmed by that pain and suffering because it was not outside, but he was also free enough to not take it on. It's not him, but it is his responsibility.

I'll end with a poem:

Sitting by the river, crying out for a drink.  
This thirst is older than time.  
This water has never been absent.  
Let's go down together to the river's edge  
and discover the realm beyond wanting.  
Don't you know you were born as a water dragon,  
already satisfied in the season beyond knowing?

Thank you for your practice. Thank you for being here this morning. Thanks so much for listening.

I must say that the chanting feels really strong. Thich Nhat Hanh used to say, the future Buddha is the Sangha. It's not one singular person, but it's a collective. The Maitreya Buddha is the Buddha of the future. It's what all of us are doing. So I could feel that this morning. I got a little chills and a little teary right now. So strong in this renewal of vow ceremony—both our own and together as a collective—the harmful karma that we've created, harmful actions.

And I also want to bring in some aspect of the question of what is sacred, our sacred life, what is sacredness? Treating things with respect, treating ourselves with respect, and creating sacred space, is what we're doing—a respectful space together.

This ceremony, primarily Fusatsu renewal of vows, sometimes translated as continuous, good, wholesome practice, rather than ceasing from unwholesome action, is what we're renewing. It gives us a chance to atone, to be at one, not separate from any, whatever kinds of harmful karma or separation we have created. Created by me. If you haven't noticed, Zen liturgy is very direct. We don't look over there. It's created by me since of old. And to recommit to practicing good, actualizing good for others, being guided by the precepts—the moral and ethical teachings—to live in harmony with our nature.

And these precepts aren't fixed. They're seen from different perspectives, but from a Mahayana perspective, they're very open and in accord with time. What time is it? What's our place in what's happening? What's our position? What's the circumstance? So at one moment something might be the right thing to do, and in the next moment, totally wrong. So we have to be in accord with what the circumstances are. And it's all to save life, to be of benefit.

But we also need to recognize that as human beings, there's always some harm that is being created all the time, just because we have to live, we have to eat, we have to have shelter, and we have to have food and clothing. And this is all, in some ways, harming something so that we can have life. But this has to be kept, of course, in balance.

So this ceremony goes back to the time of the Buddha. I'm not going to go into that too much. He would gather his community on the full moon and everyone would look at the precepts and say out loud to each other where one transgressed, where we broke a precept. Can you imagine, if we all went around today and the precepts that we have—the ten, we have sixteen in our tradition, in the Zen tradition—and each, every religion has sort of these moral and ethical guidelines which can seem very similar.

But Buddhism is based on non-self, it's non-theistic. So there's nothing—how might we be guided when there's no external person or thing that demands us to be a certain way? There's no God who is judging. That's all based on our own human experience. And from a Buddhist perspective, actions are both good—in a relative world, both good and bad have consequences. And these consequences shape our future experience in a concept known as karma. And they also go backwards so they can affect what has happened. It's all happening now. There's only now, there's only this moment. But how we understand the past affects what we will act in the future. Only now, because we're in this moving, unfixed momentariness of our life. That's what our life is. We have this body and it's changing and it's just seeing into the aggregates, into the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, that they're all not fixed.

So our sixteen precepts begin with three refuges in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. And then there's the three pure precepts: not creating evil or harm, practicing good, and actualizing good for others. And then the ten grave precepts is how to do that: To be affirming of life, not kill life. To be giving, to not steal. This is how it's phrased in our tradition. Honor the body, do not misuse sexuality. Manifest truth, do not lie. Proceed clearly, do not cloud the mind. See the perfection, don't speak of others' errors and faults. Realize self and other as one, don't elevate yourself and blame others. Give generously, don't be withholding. Actualize harmony, do not be angry. And experience the intimacy of things, don't defile the three treasures.

So all of the precepts are about living the life of a Buddha—not about how to be good and live by the precepts, but rather to help us and challenge us in a way to examine who we are as killers, who we are as stealers, as misusers of sexuality, as liars, as addicts of intoxicants, as blamers, misers, angry people, abusers of the three treasures. So if we look deep enough, we can see we are not separate, that we have all of that potential within us. And if you have the Buddhist perspective of karma, you might say we've done this hundreds of thousands of times before. In some way, we know this, we know this.

So Buddha realized there is non-self, and the precepts are based on this non-self as the basis, as the fundamental—that there's that emptiness of all the conditions and that he said the word karma simply means intentional action, this relationship between what we choose to do and then what we make of ourselves, how we shape ourselves and are shaped by ourselves, through action, moment to moment, by this coming together as this. Right now, there's all these causes and conditions that form each of us. But it's moving, it's not fixed. But I manifest as Hojin, as a blessing, and here we are. And this is not fixed. It's constantly in a process of movement, and it's a very... and all of that is born of my body, from my consciousness, from my body, my mouth, my thoughts. So it's a very open system.

And then this future setup of our karma will be either skillful or unskillful—what we will inherit further downstream in the flow of our consciousness. And we can't always see that. So this principle of cause and effect is the centerpiece of the Buddha's teaching. And many teachers say, just understand cause and effect, just understand karma. So there's a lot that we can look at here.

This is a ceremony. And I want to just say again what Maezumi Roshi, Daido's teacher, speaks about on what ceremonial action is. He says this word ""ceremony,"" karamonia, is related to cura, meaning cure—the act of healing or being healed. In other words, ceremony is an act that cures or heals or by which something is healed. In having a ceremony or in doing ceremonial action, we must ask what is healed by what? What is healed by what?

He says the definition of ceremony also includes the word law, the laws of life. From morning until night, our life is continuous ritual, governed by rules, regulations, and laws. Behaving informally, can we follow the laws or regulations that are essential to living a healthy life? He says the word heal means be healthy, be whole and sound, make our life healthy. Is ceremonial. So in renewal of vows, we're making our life wholesome and healthy again by freshening the direction we want to live in. That's healing, that's ceremony.

And we have these rituals, these things we're doing. And he says, don't think ritual's that far away. We're constantly—our lives are full of ritual, as I said. Some people say, oh, there's too much ritual in Zen. But when we look at it, it's happening all the time. From the moment we get up and put our feet on the floor and take our shower and make our coffee and brush our teeth and wash our face and eat, going about these simple things in an orderly way, that's ritual.

So when we do this with others, as the Buddha did, we build sacred trust in community because others help us see our blind spots. We can't do it alone, right? We know that others help us see our blind spots. They inform us in one way or another what our actions are doing and how they're landing.

So I wanted to look at today, the first pure precept, a little deeper: not creating evil, not creating harm. And in some ways, I could say, period, end of suffering, don't do it, don't make more harm. We're already acknowledging we do and we have, but don't create harm.

So in a sense, I think these precepts are the highest art practice—to be conscious of our actions, what we're creating, we need to acknowledge we're always creating harm just by living in this sacred body on the sacred planet with sacred beings. So how do we respect life? When Buddha developed his teaching on karma, it was not by speculating, but he was carefully observing his own life, exactly how things worked in his own life. And it's true today, that's how you learn about it. We observe what's happening in our life each.

The clarity on karma comes from each of us studying, inspecting with focus and clarity exactly how things go for us. How's this going? Where is it landing? Daido Roshi used to say, what you do and what happens to you are the same thing. And for some of us, this karma has lasted a lifetime. Since we've heard it, what you do and what happens to you are the same thing.

So the principle of karma has two parts: the karma of cause and the karma of effect or the result. So the cause, as Buddha says, is a way of acting and to bring to consciousness the acts that we create that are unresolved. So the acts that we do that leave a kind of hangover, the feeling that we're doing something that's not kosher. We're doing something and we could feel it. It's got a hangover. It's not quite kosher. It's continuing to be resolved.

So he says we're like a weather system—it will produce increasing cloudiness of similarly unresolved situations. And he uses the word that haunts. Haunts this particular relationship and others until we deal with it. So if we feel that weather system, that not so kosher, something still resolving in our relationship, according to the teachings we have since beginningless beginning a mass of unresolved karma. That doesn't sound like good news. But if we're getting conscious, then we can be at one with it and resolve it. That's the thing, you know, jealousy—I've had that affliction since I can remember nursery school. And I don't know how long it's been going. And I still feel it and it haunts me. I feel it, really get to like, what is it? What do I not feel like I have enough of right now that I'm jealous, that I can't be happy and someone else is happy? Not everywhere, but things. There's a certain unresolved hangover that I feel. Some of us, it's being prideful or stingy, whatever. You know, you have to look at what happens that you see repeating. That's a kind of a hangover and it just doesn't feel right. And that's good news. Actually, this is all good news. That's why we're practicing. That's why it's called practice. Because we want to bring out of the darkness of ignorance our consciousness.

And we see this at a large scale right now. You know, the fear of darkness. Darkness is where wisdom is, actually. We're afraid of darkness and they send you earth. A lot about that helps us to see that that's where so many nutrients are unfinished. Created by cause remains in the body. And we experience this as tension. When something's unresolved, we get tense about it. Don't you? Like when I feel this jealousy arrive, I know my jaw gets really tight. I can't hear things well. I'm absorbed by this feeling. And so I don't even hear people talking to me when it's inactivated. I can't even hear what the person's saying in a lot of cases. So these are good clues that something's happening.

So we feel it in our body in the form of unacknowledged feelings, emotions, sensations that we might hold at bay. And we get really tense, finding ourselves resisting our bodies. And then there's this log jam of incomplete experience in our body. I see head shaking. Yep, know that one. The log jam. It just gets really tight.

We have ways that we can breathe and see what's happening. It's like, oh, there you are, there you are. Coming into consciousness out of the dark doesn't feel great, can be discomforting. We may want to run, we may want to perpetuate it because it also can bring a feeling that feels momentarily good. Like anger can feel super good for a moment and then the haunt comes—That was not so kosher. That was not so good.

How do we find the wisdom? Intention, not inattention. Intention to not make harm to ourself and others when we're in that. Because that's when it happens. Usually in that unawareness of what we're experiencing, that's where we create more harm. That's what I notice, at any rate.

So we have our zazen, which allows us to take time to learn, to slow down, see what's appearing. You know, there's a mantra in somatic experience that says slow down to go fast, slow down to experience, to go fast. But we just want to go fast. We don't want this there. Get out, get rid of it. And then to not personally identify and hold space. It's not you, it's not you. This is the karma moving through. There's sensations telling us, practicing good kindness, allowing space, allowing them to be seen, allowing what needs to be seen, seen, metabolized, released when ready, connect with our grounded body, our open heart and our clear mind.

So when we atone—at one with—doesn't mean something just drops off and ""ah, I'm at one with it."" We have to keep going back again and doing more of this process of allowing it to be seen, metabolized and released. That's how that at-one-ment continues.

I love the work of Marion Woodman, a lot of you—she's a Jungian analyst and she has this quote that I've always loved that says, ""If we could allow the pace of our meetings to slow down to the pace of our hearts, we might find genuine understanding."" Whether that's meeting each other or situation or ourself. If we could allow the pace of our meeting, whatever we're experiencing, to slow down to the pace of our heart, catch up to it, we might find genuine understanding.

And then there's the karma of effect. That's good. As Buddha put it, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their actions, have their actions as refuge. It is an action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior. Contemplate the entire bank of unresolved karma that accompanies us in each moment, recognizing that all this actually is the result of previous actions.

The Buddha realized the absolute nature of things, human and non-human, is without this fixed characteristic. And because we have human consciousness, we think because we have intention in there, not but an intention. Once we see what's emerging, we make decisions, we perceive good and bad, we perceive pain and pleasure for the most part, that everything we do has an effect. So everything that we do, Buddha realized, has a moral quotient for ourselves and others. And he said to begin practicing means to begin by ceasing from evil, from harming.

Dogen wrote in an essay on not creating harm. Now stay with it. This is Dogen. He's going to somersault us a bit. If we don't do harm or make harm, it doesn't exist on its own. Okay? If we don't do harm or make harm, it doesn't exist on its own. It takes someone or something to create it.

So when the precepts were often referred to as standards for monastic bodhisattvas. And a Bodhisattva is a great practitioner walking on the path toward Buddhahood. All of you, all of us, myself, walking on the path to Buddhahood to be of benefit to all beings. And we won't check out until we do that. Every one of them comes through. Every one of them as well as us. Sentient beings are numberless. I vow to save them. It's continuous.

And Asanga, who was a 4th century teacher, founder of the Mind Only or Yogacara school, made it clear that a lay Bodhisattva path—so your lay practitioners, I'm a monastic—is an essential element of the Mahayana and that got passed to the Zen tradition. And these three pure precepts were written out as embracing and sustaining standards of conduct, morality: Do not create evil, embracing and sustaining good qualities, practicing good, embracing and sustaining living beings, actualizing good for others.

And lay and monastic bodhisattvas embrace not so much what form our life takes, but our embracing and sustaining the standards of conduct of our particular life role. Letting go of our self-centeredness, which often brings harm to others. So we're encouraged to appreciate the embracing aspect, to experience harmony with our actions, embracing our conduct. We're encouraged to do that. Embrace it, not push it away. Get rid of it. Where are we going to put it? It's like we put our trash out on the curb. But where's it going? It's not like we get rid of it. It's going somewhere. It has another place it's going, right? She works there on the receiving end.

So there's a little book by Buddha I have on the Dhammapada I travel with. And in there it said, ""Refrain from harm, do all good, purify the mind. This is the teaching of all Buddhas. Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief, they are all mind-wrought.""

So Dogen transmitted this precept of embrace and sustain standards of conduct. And he wrote an essay, ""Refrain from All Harm."" And he tells the story of this Chinese Zen teacher named Bird's Nest, who was called this because he lived up in a tree and he was called Bird's Nest.

So the story goes, there was a statesman and a poet who was the student of Bird's Nest. And one time the statesman stood below the tree and called up to him and said, ""Looks pretty precarious and dangerous up there."" And Bird's Nest said down to him, ""Looks pretty precarious and dangerous down there."" Indeed it is precarious and dangerous to actually go about in the world outside of trees, because it's so easy to get into, cause harm and forget about doing good.

Once a statesman asked, ""What is the great meaning of Buddhist teachings?"" That was always a question in ancient China by a lot of practitioners. And his teacher replied, ""So what's the great meaning of Buddhist teaching?"" And the teacher replied, ""Refrain from harm, do all good."" And the statesman said, ""Though this is so, even a three-year-old child can say that."" And the teacher said, ""A three-year-old child may be able to say it, but an eighty-year-old person cannot practice it."" And the statesman bowed in thanks to that response.

And Dogen comments on this story saying, ""Since the family of Buddhas arises from conditions, thus conditions arise from the family of Buddhas. It is not that harm does not exist, it's just that it is not done."" And in this writing called ""Shawaku Makusa,"" the characters mean ""do not do all harm."" But it can also read as Dogen says, ""All harm is not done. Harm is not empty, it is not done. Harm is not form, it is not done. Harm is not not done, it is just not done."" I know you'll have to take that little strip home, but these are the Dharma's not easy, right? We have to stretch a bit. It's not to twist us up and say, oh, this is just hogwash. You know, we have to sit with it. We have to work with these words to see the great reality that's being shown to us. Seeing it is not substantial and not denying what is. Here. We need both legs—that something is not substantial, and yet here it is. Here's the situation. This is what's arising. Just this. Otherwise it's one-sided.

Dogen says ceasing from evil is the abiding place of all Buddhas. This abiding place is the state of non-duality, of not knowing and non-separation. The Sixth Ancestor defines zazen as the state of mind in which there is no separation between subject and object, no space between you and me, or all the space up and down, right and wrong, being open to all the way of our lives and not having an answer. The flowering of zazen is doing good for others. Dogen says this is to transcend the profane and to be beyond the holy. This is to liberate oneself and others.

I love that the word Buddha is related to the English word ""bud."" A flower's awakening or opening. We could say the ""budd away."" The ""budd away"" is unattainable. The blossoming, the fruitful practice field where we can practice all of it. Budding, fruitful, blossoming. How do we lead ourselves? That's the question. To lead ourselves, to lead the people. Let harmony pervade everywhere. We can do this. This is how we heal and bloom the living as we are, serving within the intimate web of our collective beingness.

And I'd like to, since we have a short amount of time—this was an essay that somebody passed to me this week called ""You'd Sacredness"" by Jaya John.

The Ancient: Your sacredness. Your sacredness.  
The Ancient One spoke with a depth of prayer.  
Something immeasurably divine, sacred and miraculous is happening now.  
You are happening. You are alive.  
Life comes down to two questions: What do you consider sacred? And how do you treat your sacred things?  
You are a sacred land. This means everything.  
People cannot treat you however they wish, nor can you treat yourself according to any impulse or mood.  
You are a place where ancestors rest and ceremonies are performed.  
You are sacred. Water, fire, sky, earth.  
The first act in a beautiful life is to recognize the truth of who you are.  
You are Sacredness.  
As long as you stay in this truth, you may have your beautiful life.  
This world will often act to persuade you otherwise.  
It will whisper and shout that you are not sacred, that you are less than, that your entire life is soulless.  
You are a salmon swimming upstream against a degrading current that wants your soul.  
You were born to swim upstream to spawn beauty in your life and feed generations their own chance to live, always upstream against a current.  
This can be hard. It can be the sweetest journey.  
Our great misunderstanding is that we believe some things are meant to be done soullessly and other things soulfully.  
Gradually, more and more we live soullessly, believing it to be an easier way.  
Nothing is meant to be lived soullessly.  
It all has the Buddha nature.  
Ease has nothing to do with it.  
You are a soulful thing.  
Live soulfully.  
Live the way of the Buddha.

Thanks so much for listening.

As you'll hear, Dharma Encounters begin with the introduction of a topic related to Zen practice and training. Students then volunteer to present their understanding of the topic or a question for the Dharma Encounter teacher to reflect on. The presence of fellow students means that anyone in attendance can benefit from the exchange. We hope you enjoy.

Good morning, everybody. So this morning is Dharma Encounter as we are concluding our April session. For those unfamiliar, this is one of the teaching methods in our tradition, along with teisho, the mando, face-to-face teaching, and everyday interactions. In the history of Buddhism, going back to the Buddha and in many practice-based traditions, there are meetings between a teacher and a student in which a question is raised, a point is made. Sometimes it's instructional, sometimes it's guiding, sometimes it's what we call in our tradition direct pointing, which is not so much about information, but really trying to shift a student's state of mind, open a door, to reveal something about their own self-nature. And so Dharma Encounter is meeting each other in that field.

What I wanted to focus on today was to continue a little bit with what I took up yesterday in the teisho, which is the training relationship—speaking of it that way—between the student and teacher. Everybody who encounters Buddhism learns pretty quickly that an essential teaching, particularly in Mahayana Buddhism, is that everyone is endowed with Buddha Nature, which means from the beginning you have what you seek in an ultimate sense. If what we're looking for is an ultimate experience of peace, fulfillment, a resolution of all that is not resolved in the deepest sense, then the Buddha realized that we all have that within us. We're not going to find that outside.

Within many of the traditions of Buddhism, there is the role of the teacher, beginning with the Buddha. So what is that, given that the student is already in full possession of an enlightened mind? So that's what I wanted to look at a little bit.

Now, drawing on yesterday's teachings from Master Dogen: Dogen taught that Shakyamuni Buddha saw Mahakasyapa, his disciple, in person, and Mahakasyapa saw the Venerable Ananda, his successor, in person. And Ananda bowed formally to Mahakasyapa's Buddha face. This is face-to-face transmission. Dogen says an ancestor, a teacher or a disciple, cannot be a Buddha or an ancestor—or I would say a student—without having face-to-face transmission. It's like pouring water into the ocean and spreading it endlessly, or like transmitting the lamp and allowing it to shine forever. The disciple sees the teacher, the teacher sees the disciple. They meet each other, they see each other. As Dogen said, in person.

There are many ways we can think of and talk about being a student, of the way we come in, having been students, most of us, in school for many years, which means you go to a classroom, typically there's a teacher who has certain information, has gained certain knowledge, has certain understanding. They impart that in various ways. The student is there to receive that, to learn, to integrate it. And so we come in with years of history embodied within us about being a student. And of course, we're going to carry much of that in. Some of that's going to be helpful, some of it may not be.

So what I wanted to look at is some of the basic tensions, what I often think of as tensions—important, necessary tensions. Within practice, we often think of tension as a negative thing, stress-related, causing pain and discomfort. This is different. It can cause discomfort and stress, for that matter, but in a healthy way, in a way of working towards something, another resolution, really. So while I think of it often in terms of tensions, we can also look at it in terms of dualities.

So here are a few to reflect on. Having Buddha Nature, we each, as students, need to trust ourselves in a deep way. Daido Roshi used to say that over and over again: trust yourself, profoundly trust in yourself. We also need to trust the teacher if we're going to study with the teacher. Otherwise, obviously, it doesn't make sense to do that. Sometimes those are in alignment. What if they're not? What is trust in the teacher and trust in oneself? To rely on your own understanding, because you're developing understanding, you're here. We're here to develop understanding—direct understanding, transformational understanding, the understanding of awakened mind. And so to rely on understanding, at the same time to question our understanding, to be able to doubt our understanding.

The tension between speaking too much, speaking too little—what does that mean? What might that mean in the context of being a student, particularly in the Zen tradition? There's a lot of emphasis on relying too much on the intellect, the conceptual, trying to figure things out, make everything line up, bring the Dharma into conformity with a linear, rational way of seeing things based on what we already know. And so there's a lot of encouragement to free ourselves of that. But at the same time, on the other side, we can ignore the intellect and conceptual in being a student.

It's common at moments, sometimes often, to be insecure, to doubt oneself, to doubt one's understanding, doubt one's capacity. And so there's building confidence. But on the other side of that is being arrogant, being confident in an unrealistic way, being confident in a way that's not actually confidence, but it's just self-grasping.

It's very common in being a student to want to seek the approval of the teacher. If that relationship doesn't matter to us, it's not a healthy relationship. But that can become a kind of seeking of approval that is not healthy. But on the other side of that is not seeking approval in a way that's not healthy. Wanting to be special, wanting to be seen, wanting to be the best, a shining star. On the other side of that is wanting not to be seen, wanting not to be heard, wanting to be challenged, not wanting to be challenged.

In gaining confidence, which is a really essential part of the practice and training, there's gaining confidence, which can become arrogance, and then there's humility. In a sense, as we gain confidence, continuing to have and develop humility becomes even more important and more real. There's following the example of the teacher—just natural. It's important, it's one of the ways we learn. I spoke about that yesterday. But not imitating.

And so in a way, we can think of these as tensions or dualities. And in that sense, they're not questions that we just seek an answer to and then the tension goes away. They're lived experiences. The Buddha said our impulse is to swing between extremes. One of the fundamental extremes in Buddhism is annihilism—misunderstanding, emptiness, nothing is, nothing exists. And on the other hand is eternalism—everything is just a material object that exists unto itself. But there are many ways we can look at the Middle Way: rejecting and grasping, too loose, too tight. And those extremes and the freedom from those extremes, actually liberating ourselves within the Middle Way, is a lived thing. It's not a formula that we have to find the correct answer to.

And so, how do you live those tensions, those dynamics in the path of being a student of the Way? How do we seek the teachings without abdicating responsibility, as Dogen says, wholeheartedly, unreservedly, relying upon the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha? How do we do that without turning away from ourselves? How to have faith in the Buddha Nature, in Buddha Nature, in being a person of suchness, while accepting our own delusion, accepting other people's, having faith in other people's Buddha Nature, while accepting their delusion and attachments?

In the case that I took up yesterday, Master Keizan said—he talked about in terms of purity, and I spoke about that. But I want to frame this in terms of selflessness. He said, those who are really selfless do not even establish selflessness. And so their vessel, their Buddha body as a vessel of the Dharma, is not established either. This is why the path of teacher and apprentice, or teacher and student, merge. This is how they merge: that those on the path of selflessness do not even establish selflessness. He said, when you enter into the Way, then you can be called a teacher. You can also be called a student. Therefore, the student climbs over the head of the teacher, and the teacher descends to the feet of the disciple. At this point, there is no duality, no discrimination. The term Buddha, body, vessel, student, teacher, no longer really applies. The disappearance of this represents the realization of the path.

And so, in that way, he's really laying out in a very deep, ultimate sense, the path of the student of the Way. And so that's what I wanted to look at. What is student in Buddha Dharma? What is that? We use that term often and freely. We have a path for entering into formal training as a training student. It was a very clear and deliberate process and path. But anyone who practices the Dharma can consider themselves a student of the Dharma. What is student and what is teacher? What is teacher? It's really important that in our training that we are clarifying this and not just assuming, making assumptions, or taking for granted. Because I am here, I'm a student. Because I have a gray robe, I'm a student. Because I go to dokusan and ask a question, I'm a student. There's some truth to those things, but they're really more on the surface, and the student has some very particular responsibilities. The responsibilities of being a student. The teacher, of course, has very particular responsibilities that are essential to being in that role. So what is student? What is teacher? That's what I wanted to look at today.

So Daio will come first. And part of this is good in and of itself and as training. But also that next month, at the end of the May session, Daio will be giving a short talk on a Case Koan and then inviting all of you dragons and elephants to engage him in Dharma Encounter, as I am doing today. So this is both training for that. It's for you dragons and elephants to sharpen your claws and tusks.

So Daio will go first and do three bows. And I'd like to open this up to any of you who are doing the ango, and also, it would be good to have some of you who have spent years in training and have experience in that role as a student, have really engaged that at a deep level and over time. And also some of you who are doing the ango, who are much newer to that, who are newer in being a student, or maybe not even students yet, or training, formal training. And if any of you who just got up, did last month's Dharma Encounter, maybe yield to somebody who hasn't done it yet, this ango.

**Student:** Shusanji, one of the aspects of my service position that I've been aware of is speaking more. And so my words... your words, to make a dichotomy. So considering what I'm going to say and not thinking it to death, the dichotomy of teacher and student—say yesterday, you talked about, whose vessel is it? Is it my vessel? Is it your vessel? Are they my words? Are they your words? Are they the words of a koan I just read in a book? I'm just noticing that that's not... that's not completely fluent in me. I'm... I'm setting things up.

**Teacher:** By whose authority do you sit in this role as chief disciple? Anything more? Anything more? Who would you leave out? Who have you left out? The one wearing the robe, the one who is clarifying what is underneath this robe. Whether we feel ready or not, capable or not, we have to step forward under our own authority. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

---

**Student:** So, Shusanji, very soon after I became your student, I came into the room and I said something like, ""I don't think I know what to do with this relationship,"" or something like, ""I don't know how to use this relationship to the best."" And you kind of sat up and you said, ""This is not a relationship. When you come in here, it's just you."" And I had no idea what you were talking about, and it kind of hurt at the time. And I feel like, you know, all these years later, maybe I maybe a little bit understand what you meant, but I would like to know, because I still don't feel like I really know how to use this in the best way. If I ask you again, how would you answer me?

**Teacher:** Now, let me ask it this way. Let me answer this. Recognizing that you don't know how to fully use this, how does that sit inside of you? That's how. That's how it resolves. When yesterday I said, there needs to be discomfort or else it's not alive. But I can speak of it in terms of tensions. I could speak of it in terms of discomforts, different aspects of a lack of comfort, of dis-ease. And that's... you know, we're so conditioned to many unhealthy ways in which there's tension and discomfort. But here, it's really vital.

You know, I mentioned that all the years I went into dokusan, and in the very last times I ever saw my teacher in dokusan, you know, I never went in casually. You know, I was always a little bit... you know, and in the beginning, it was a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety, a lot of the things I was just mentioning, a lot of myself, a lot of my ego. And as those things changed, you know, in a sense, what remained was your question: How do I really use this, right? Have I really... am I doing that? Have I really, you know... and not use him, you know, it can sound like that. It's not that. Use what he was offering by sitting in that seat and ringing that bell and inviting me in. And so what I said, I stand by that, and I'll leave you with that.

But at the same time, you know, there is another side to that. You know, relationship—I always pause a little bit in using that in terms of this, because relationship is kind of like love. Relationship has so much meaning, you know, I am in relationship with... but there is that. And the danger of not seeing that is that the teacher has a very important role and responsibility, which means we are in relationship, right? So to say it's all you, there's a truth to that. That's what I was pointing to. But I am part of this, the teacher is part of this, right? It's not just the student. That's what makes it alive. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** Shusanji, so as a student, I try to show up authentically. What does that mean for me? What that means is I'm so aware that I hold myself back and I have a tension that kind of has, in my mind, defined me. And so being authentic and showing up for me is to be able to not be holding it back with that old barrier of my story about myself. And when I'm... and it's been my struggle. So how can you be authentic in the midst of that story, in facing your teacher?

**Teacher:** Well, I don't know how. I try to do it, but as I'm with you, it feels like it unfolds. It happens sometimes. In terms of what you bring to that for me is, I see your enthusiasm, and that kind of allows me to open up more. I don't know if... I don't know how to do it. Like, I don't know how to say, ""Oh, how do I access that?"" But I think it's just like by relaxing. Because I do believe that I have a certain kind of wisdom that I bring. And I also feel that I don't allow it to show. And I want it to show.

**Teacher:** So do I. I mentioned this morning, I think, that when I began sitting in that seat and students came in, that I began to learn so much about being a student. And there was so much that I reflected on about in terms of my own training as a student. And I remember one of the first times somebody came in, they sat down and they said, ""I am so nervous."" And I thought, ""Oh my God, you can say that!"" I never said that. Right? Because I grew up in the school of... as the students in the prison would say, ""You don't show your sweat."" Right? Where I grew up, that's weakness. Right? So I never just said, ""I am so nervous,"" but I was so nervous.

So in that way, how to be authentic in that moment was so simple. That's what that student was showing me. And for me, it was so far away.

And one of the things of being here is you can show it all and feel like it's okay. Because I had spent my whole life trying to cover it. Everything was trying to like, ""Oh, look how strong I could look,"" or ""look how unnervous I am.""

**Teacher:** Because if you had shown it the way you feel able to do here, what would have happened or what did happen that held you back or taught you that you couldn't?

**Student:** You know, it was my whole, my whole, like my entire life was like that until I really came here and I could sit here and say like, ""I'm not okay."" I don't know what that story was, but it was a hard, hard-wired one. And I put all of my energy into not letting anybody see how scared I was. But I think it was that because no one ever responded.

**Teacher:** Yeah. Yeah, you know. You know, that's... I mean, isn't that what we have to do to be, to be a student? We have to be willing to say, ""I don't know, I don't understand, I can't do this by myself."" We have to be willing to say that. When a student comes in and does shoken for the first time, there's a formal way of doing nine bows, but the way they actually say that has to be their own words, right? They have to say it in their own words. They have to say, ""Please teach me."" How important is that? Why is that important? I'm asking.

**Student:** Yeah. No, I'm asking. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll give you a minute.

**Student:** Yeah, you're asking and... yeah, I'm trying to answer. Sorry. Because that... well, the real please, which is please, Shugen, do teach me is getting to that authentic... yeah... place.

**Teacher:** Yeah. So please do teach me. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

---

**Teacher:** You know, I think of those gates of entry, beginning with the introductors retreat. Each of those is teaching us something about being a student of the Way. Just understanding the path that we're entering into. Meeting with the guardian council, being asked those questions. Why now? Why beneath that now? Why beneath that now? Why beneath that, when you don't want to do this? Why? We don't really have that many opportunities or encounters where we're asked in that way to get clear about something that we're often not really clear about. To have a simple cup of tea and offer a gift, to do a full day of tankaryo.

Oftentimes with students after they've entered, I'll say, reflect on each of those. What were each of those showing you? Because they keep... they're showing each student, each of us, something important—not just for that process of entry, but along the way. And like asking, right? We need to keep asking. Teachers need to keep asking to be taught, to receive the teachings. I think the most important thing to be a teacher is first to be a student—still, always.

---

**Student:** Shusanji. Sorry, this is... my feet are cramped. Well, I'll just have to deal with it. So I was thinking back when I got into this, I had no idea what I was getting into.

**Teacher:** Isn't that a good thing?

**Student:** It's wonderful. I still don't know.

**Teacher:** And so how do you hold that up alongside what you do know?

**Student:** I just take one step after another.

**Teacher:** What do you do with what you do know?

**Student:** How may I help you?

**Teacher:** How does that... how can that transform into not being a student? ""I know how to help you."" What about that which you know? How can that cease to be something that you actually know?

**Student:** What am I doing here? I don't know. I... I don't have anything to offer. Self-doubt.

**Teacher:** But what's another way—can you repeat it? Can you repeat it? What's another way in which that which you know truly moves you away from being a student?

**Student:** I know, right? When it becomes something...

**Teacher:** Yeah, when you become something. You know, I've been talking about the Prajnaparamita Sutra. It's so unrelenting. You know, the Buddha said, the Bodhisattva does not think, ""I am practicing. I am gaining insight. I am letting go. I am serving, I am giving."" How wonderful.

**Student:** Indeed.

**Teacher:** Indeed. So, okay. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

---

**Teacher:** I remember years ago, there was a student—a very good student, fine, excellent person, really sincere student—who left training. And my sense of it was that there was an ambition that was impatient and it wanted more, sooner. And I remember talking to Daido Roshi about that. And I said, ""Well, you know, the path is about building confidence. Building confidence in one's own ability, one's capacity, one's understanding. So why does that happen to everybody, right? Why doesn't every student get to a point where there's, like, you know, whether it's ambition or just, you know, 'I got what I came for.'"" And he said, ""Well, part of the role of the teacher is to try and keep showing the student that there's more. Showing the student what isn't yet clear.""

---

**Student:** So, Shusanji. Sho-san-shi. Yes, 'san' is Dharma encounter. 'Shi' is teacher. So I guess being a student is trying to meet the teacher.

**Teacher:** Say more. What does that mean to you?

**Student:** Like Dogen talked about, in person. I didn't hear your Dharma talk, but... yeah, while still dripping with birth water, speak from that place. What is student?

**Student:** Yeah. It's taking a lot of sense, being very courageous.

**Teacher:** And why is that important? Why is that needed?

**Student:** Because all of life is meeting the teacher. All of life is trying to meet the student.

**Teacher:** Why is courage important?

**Student:** Disruption.

**Teacher:** No. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Teacher:** It sounds nice when we're talking about it. When it's happening, it's not that.

---

**Student:** Shusanji, as I prepare to enter formal training, I am someone still in the womb, knocking, pecking.

**Teacher:** Okay.

**Student:** I am so afraid of so many things. I spent years meditating and not telling anyone that I was doing it, trying to hide that I was doing it. If someone found out, I would minimize it, you know, brush it off.

**Teacher:** Why?

**Student:** Vulnerability. It's admitting that I don't know, that I feel like something is missing, that something is not satisfying, that I'm not put together, and that I'm trying to see if there's something else, that, if anything, can change.

**Teacher:** And what does it mean to be vulnerable?

**Student:** It means to shed everything that isn't true about myself. And that sounds very big. Just in one moment, one moment of vulnerability. What does that mean? Rather than thinking of shedding everything—to be here in this seat, to do the thing that makes me shake, that has me shaking for the last 15 minutes online, nonstop.

**Teacher:** You know, Brené Brown said that when she talked about vulnerability, said that we all move towards it when we see it in somebody, right? It really is compelling. It opens our heart. So we really are attracted to it. But we don't want to be vulnerable. Why? What is the fear? What is the expectation behind being vulnerable?

**Student:** For me, it's rejection.

**Teacher:** Exactly. Exactly. And I have to think that that is—or I do think, I just wonder if that is—a really ancient, primordial fear. Rejection from your people, your tribe, right? Which meant to be cast out, which was death. And then on a deep, deep level in our genes is that concern.

But how can you transform that into something that helps you?

**Student:** That vulnerability is the sign of my humanity. It's the connection that we all share, that it's something that's in everyone. It means that we're all humans and that we're born to be in community, born to be with each other. And that fear is universal. People just respond to it differently. Like when a person is arrogant, why? What is the need for that? What is that serving, right?

**Teacher:** And so to... the fear of being rejected by others is strong. But what's even stronger? What rejection is even stronger than that?

**Student:** What rejection is even stronger is more significant—the rejection of what's real inside me. Rejecting yourself.

**Teacher:** We can have the love and affirmation and support of everyone, and it won't mean very much at all. Truly, it will not mean very much at all if we have... if we are not in full embrace, in person, with ourselves. You don't have to look very far to see testimonies to that. That's why that is never enough. Right? So we'll see you on the other side. Thank you for your teaching.

---

**Student:** So, Shusanji, I actually was reflecting on Daido's entreaty to trust yourself. And it always used to make me a little nutty when he would say that. Because, you know, I, like the rest of us, have led a life, and I've made a lot of mistakes. I've made mistakes, I've hurt people. And so I thought, how do I trust, since there were impulses that I followed which resulted in damage? How could I trust myself? And then on top of that, well, wait a minute. So how...

**Teacher:** How what? How to trust yourself? How to trust yourself in the recognition that you have done untrustworthy things?

**Student:** In this context, I guess I don't even know there's a...

**Teacher:** Wait a minute. I don't buy that. I really, absolutely, simply do not buy that. Prove me wrong. Prove me right.

**Student:** Well, those reflections were reflections on the past, and the past is past.

**Teacher:** But we're talking about you trusting yourself now, right? Because the trust of now is now.

**Student:** But does that mean you're... you're beyond... you're beyond the point of being able to make a mistake and hurt somebody?

**Teacher:** Certainly not.

**Teacher:** Okay, so how do you trust yourself knowing that?

**Student:** Something about awareness.

**Teacher:** Okay.

**Student:** An understanding of action, of choice.

**Teacher:** Whose?

**Student:** Mine.

**Teacher:** Yes. And through—I want to say the filter, although that sounds technical—of the teaching. The teachings of the Dharma.

**Teacher:** That's all good. But you're still on the couch.

**Student:** What couch?

**Teacher:** The couch that you're sitting on. There's awareness, right? There's understanding that there's cause and effect. There's understanding. What do you need to do with that understanding?

**Student:** Act upon it.

**Teacher:** Sounds good. Live it. Live it.

So how do we trust? You know, I often say, how do we walk on the path of enlightening—verb, enlightening—while still deluded? How do we walk on a path of cultivated, great, boundless compassion while still not always compassionate? Right. Knowingly.

I've told somebody during the session about the subject of trust. My brother, my beloved brother—I love you, brother, wherever you are. When I was younger, he had a rep in our family for being late, right? He was late. He was always late. And he would just be up doing crazy stuff, meeting somebody, going... you know, he was a very interesting young person. But we were sitting there waiting for him. And so at a certain point, we decided and we said, ""We're not going to wait for you anymore. So we're going to meet here, and then we're going to go there. And if you're not there, we're going, and you can try and find us.""

So how did we trust? How did I trust my brother knowingly? I love him. I trust you, but not to be on time. Right. So we can trust knowingly, which incorporates those things that are not wholly trustworthy. Does that make sense? We're not blind. We're not blind to the ways in which... I'm not blind to the ways in which I can be selfish, lazy, you know, hurtful, misspeaking. Right? But if I don't trust myself, I can't do this. I wouldn't even be here, and neither would you. That's why I'm not buying it. So stop buying it. Get out of here. May your life go well.

**Student:** That's what I've been waiting for. Here I am. I've never done this before. I've never felt this before.

**Teacher:** That's a beautiful thing. Can you appreciate that?

**Student:** I'm trying.

**Teacher:** Yeah. Yeah. There's confidence in that. That there's something here. In that. From where I'm not clear, I can move forward. Don't ever doubt that.

You know, one of the things that's important to understand is the subtlety of this. You know, if we don't go to work, if we don't wash our dishes, if we don't bathe, the consequences are obvious. If we don't attend to this, the consequences are there. But they're not always so obvious. Until they are. When they become obvious, there's really no choice. Because the choice has been made, right? The alternative is no longer viable. There is no alternative. There is no alternative, no.

But there is for you and for many of us, right? I mean, in a sense, we always need to understand we are making this choice, right? But the subtlety... I mean, that's why whenever I talk to a student who's struggling, flailing, wandering, I say, just come to sesshin, right? We'll talk about it then. And it may be that by the end of this sesshin, they've decided to withdraw. Fine. But they've done that from within, not from sitting at home with a distant memory that is just now a memory. It's a thought, it's an idea. It's not in their body anymore. Get it back into your body and then see. And that's how fragile it can be, right? That's why this is so important. We have to keep coming back and drinking from that spring. Particularly because in our lives, in a world of chaos and so many things to do, right, that can be lost. You know, practice can be like what happens when you've washed your dishes, you've finished with work, and you've done everything else, right? So if it's not important, the things that are important, we do.

And so feeling that, right? That sense, and tending to that. Like a baby. Dogen said, it's like a baby. It's infinite. It's in your arms, right? If you don't feed it, it'll whimper, it'll cry for a while, and then it'll get quiet. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** Shusanji, it's taken many years, but you know, I'm really just starting to appreciate how my insecurity and my lack of vulnerability are holding me back as a student, as a practitioner. All the ways that I feel safe, stuck, and that I just can't show myself and feel like I keep shoving things down and cutting them off. And, you know, for a while, I can make that work. And then over time, it's like, this is just killing me on the inside.

**Teacher:** Yeah. Have you known you've been practicing for some years? Have you known that that's what you were doing with practice?

**Student:** Yeah, part of me always knew, but things felt like they were going okay and working out and, you know, wasn't causing any trouble. So as long as everyone else was fine, I could just keep this on the inside.

**Teacher:** And so what's different? Why should it be any different?

**Student:** Well, because as I keep turning the light around, looking at myself, it's just... I guess I just see in the ways how being inauthentic is holding myself back from really engaging practice. Like basically hitting a wall that I finally hit and seeing I can't do this anymore.

**Teacher:** You know, we were talking about this earlier in the week. Kasho brought it up in a way, a person brings it up every time they speak about something that is authentic, which is the ways in which we are conditioned, socialized—we might even say indoctrinated—not just to certain views and so on, but to a belief about who we are, fundamentally about who we can be, who we can't be, what's allowed and what's not allowed.

You know, I've talked about when I was young, growing up as a boy in Georgia, you know, the rules, the unspoken rules that were present, right? And how did you know they were present? Because if you stepped over a line, the response was immediate and swift. And very oftentimes, it was from my own friends. We did it to each other, right? We walk in a tightrope, right? We were all dying inside, right? And we kept each other on that tightrope, right? And so what had to happen for that mode of being to lead to some shift? I just had to get exhausted, just give up and surrender.

It is exhausting. You know, I was reading an article by—I think it was Naomi Klein, I think—and she was talking about the current administration and a lot of people who are in great power now. And the image of the Lone Ranger, the cowboy, right? Going off into the sunset, riding alone, doing it their own way, right? And the toxicity, the foolishness, the delusion, the danger, the unreality of that. It's so incredibly precarious, right? Everything is a threat in the veil of being impenetrable, impervious, confident, in control. It's not just killing you or me. It's killing everyone.

And so what can you do, monk of the way? Show up, offer myself, get uncomfortable, risk being judged and rejected for, at the expense of being honest with myself. Like that should come first. And provide an example. Without knowing, don't know that you are. The moment that you think that you are, come back home. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** So, Shusanji, when I came into residency earlier this year, I thought I would stay for much longer than I turned out to be staying for. And when I first told some of my friends that I was thinking about leaving—leaving here or...

**Teacher:** Yes, leaving here.

**Student:** They tried to convince me otherwise and I kind of—bah, nonsense, I have good reasons.

**Teacher:** You mean that was your response?

**Student:** Yes. Yeah, I can justify anything. But now that it's time, there's always doubts. Living a life of delusion. Sometimes you're so deep in shit, you can't see the...

**Teacher:** Yeah. So how can I trust that I'm not leaving... Daido Roshi talked about the person who's up to their eyeballs in shit, saying, ""Everything's fine, I'm good."" I'm not saying that that's you. I just brought that up in my memory. You know, the dual mind, the divided mind, wants absolute certainty. That's what it does. That's why living by dogma, living in extremes, seems safe. You know, just have a story and stick with it. Then you don't have to think, you don't have to be alert, you don't have to negotiate, you don't have to be alive. But there's no life. That's what you get.

And so, in making decisions, it's not always completely clear. When a person is in discernment to be in ordination, that's about as big a decision as a person can make, is going to make in their life, right? And so that they move towards that to develop confidence and a kind of certainty within themselves. But that doesn't mean it's 100%, nor does it mean it needs to be.

But how can you leave now, depart with some doubt, and do that without dividing yourself?

**Student:** Well, I just... I trust that I'm aware of this doubt, that I'm aware of practicing it, paying attention, keeping my eyes open, and that that's not changing.

**Teacher:** When you leave, leave. If you stay, stay. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** Shusanji, when you're talking about student, teacher, and what that's like, I guess the best way comes to my mind is a metaphor you used dealing with like a stringed instrument. And over these years, I feel that, like, I've tuned myself to you.

**Teacher:** What does that mean?

**Student:** I'm not sure I like that.

**Teacher:** Well...

**Student:** Well, everything has a resonant frequency, right? Like, and I've tried to match yours. You talk about tension, like the tension in the string.

**Teacher:** Okay, so how is that not imitation? How is that not turning away from the self? What if I go off the rails and you've attuned yourself to me?

**Student:** Yeah. Wow. I never thought of that.

**Teacher:** Think about it. It's not... I got nothing planned. But we should never think that anyone, anyone lives in a golden cage, right? Unable to stumble. And so reflect on that. Dogen, you know, that's why this is so important, right? Because there are too many stories of that kind of relationship. That kind of reliance, which starts out—can start out—very healthy and wonderful and innocent and beautiful, but then becomes something else. And particularly if the teacher's not holding the responsibility well, or is just drunk on their own power, their own desires, or they put that above the student.

One of the things about teaching that I feel is the teacher wants the student to free themselves more than anything. But they shouldn't want anything from the student. If you come, come. If you go, go. That's why every student has brought themselves here. Every one of you have brought yourself here. I mean, don't think of that in just a mechanical way. It's so important, right? Each of us is choosing this. You're practicing under your own authority. Don't give that away. That's part of the... you know. But don't get drunk on that. Don't misunderstand what that is, right? So that then we can really study.

You know, I've told the story about when I went in my teacher once and I sat down and I said, ""I'm not you."" And he just looked at me. And I said, ""The point of this is not for me to become you."" Like, I... finally, there was a point where I realized in a certain way—I wouldn't have admitted to that ever—but that in certain ways, that's what I was doing, what I thought I was supposed to be doing. And then I realized, no, that's not what I'm supposed to... that's not what he wants me to be doing. And he's my teacher, and I bow to him and ask him for the teaching. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** Shusanji, just reflecting back on all of the moments that brought me here to this moment. Our auspicious meeting in Chelsea and so many, you know, projects and desires and ideas.

**Teacher:** And what about some of those very tough moments that were happening right here? And you're here now.

**Student:** So they have dissolved in time. They have been passed through and...

**Teacher:** But what did they teach you about student, about teacher?

**Student:** That, you know, all of these manifestations that we experience with our human bodies...

**Teacher:** Who are we talking about?

**Student:** I'm talking about me and you.

**Teacher:** Okay.

**Student:** And, you know, our lives here, there's so much mystery and so much that we don't know. And that requires trust and faith as it, you know, as we pass through and as it dissolves and we find, you know, we're returning to the center that we share.

**Teacher:** And so much of that mystery is worked out in the grit, in the grit. That's the real thing. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

---

**Student:** Shusanji, so I'm good at following the rules, paying my dues, being a good girl, saying the right things. And I think I... someone's talking about what? Being authentic, sincere. It's really important for me to do that in really my heart of hearts and not just to pay my dues and put the books on the shelf properly.

**Teacher:** That's right. That is so important. And I'm going to venture to say that I think everyone here would like that. And it's a challenge. It's a tension, let's say. Because part of the way we train is meticulous effort, paying attention, right? There's somebody during all of this week who had a pair of shoes. And every time I walked down to the hallway, right? So I just observed. And then I would pick them up and I'd put them on the shelf, come out.

Right. It's not about following the rule. What is it about then? It's about picking up the shoes, feeling the suede of the shoes, putting them on the shelf, putting your hands back, shashu, walking out the door, down the steps, step by step, knowing your mind. Knowing your mind. And caring. Caring, yeah.

And how do we show that? Because caring is just a feeling until we let it be, we display it. And in that, everything receives that care. So it's really important for us to get that that point of all of this is not just to line up like good soldiers, right? But to be examining. That's why it's important to just take up this basic question: What does it mean to study, to be a student? And so to know that at this relatively early stage in your training is excellent. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

**Student:** Shosanji, being a student for me, I have not always been a good soldier. Sometimes we've disagreed. I trust you. You earn that in many ways. One is my trust in what you have dedicated your life to. You have a lot of skill and wisdom and heart. And I've seen you reflect and change your mind. I can't do this by myself. I want to live a good life. I want to be of service. I don't always know how to do that. I make lots of mistakes, but I try to learn from them.

So being a student, you know, during sesshin, I was reflecting on time. You were talking about sort of back in the day stuff. And I was like, I've been a jukai student for 20 years, and I didn't come quick to jukai. When I finally asked, Daido was like, ""It's about time."" I've grown a lot. I've grown so much in this practice, in ways that I feel good about. I know that I came in on my knees, suffering, struggling, pissed off. And I'm still pissed off sometimes. But I know better ways to deal with it. And I know how to sit down, find some space, not jump into the decision, but give myself a chance to reflect. I learned this here. Learned this from you. I learned this from Dai En. Learned from Ho Kyo.

**Teacher:** You say you can't do this by yourself. I can't do this by myself. There have been times where my mind has changed because you were not being a good soldier. Trust is earned all around in all directions. When it's injured, it can be repaired. It can be earned back. You know, as you well know, misstepping is an essential part of the path. And the question is, what happens next?

You know, Daido Roshi—and I like this, my concluding words this morning—he used to speak about, as I've said so much, about trusting yourself. Trust yourself, he would say. Trust yourself. He had a deep karmic insecurity within himself that started very early—the loss of his father. There were reasons. And then he responded to that; we all respond to it in different ways. And the way that that came out, you know, he was a very confident, very forceful teacher. You know that, right? And he loved the Dharma, and he gave his life to this tirelessly. And that karmic underlying thread was still there.

I remember when he told me he was shy, and I said, ""What are you talking about?"" He said, ""I'm actually very shy."" And then I began to watch him differently. And I realized, oh my God, it's true. He was very uncomfortable, right? When he would sit down at a table with a meal, if somebody didn't engage him, he would just sit there and eat, you know. Sound familiar to any of you? And when I would sit next to him—sometimes I would put myself next to him because I know he would be uncomfortable—and I would ask him a question, and then he would respond, and then it would get going. And part of that was my love for him, and part of it was I was uncomfortable with his discomfort.

And so part of training... Tetsugen Roshi said, while he was still Tetsugen before Bernie, that as a student trains more and more with a teacher, they become closer and closer to that teacher's hopeful wisdom, but their humanity. And he said, a lot of students don't want that. They don't want that. They want to be able to hold that person up in that way, right? And so what do we do with that humanity, right?

And so when I saw that insecurity in Daido Roshi, you know, and the way sometimes that came out towards others, and I said to him once, in a moment, I said, ""You say trust every... you trust yourself, you trust yourself, but do you trust us? Do you trust us?"" That was hard for him sometimes. And he had to, and he did. And both of those were true.

I need you. Thank you for being there. And I need you. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching. May our lives go well. Thank you for listening.

And this is from the Transmission of Light: Vasumitra. Vasumitra placed a wine vessel in front of Machaka, bowed, and stood there. Machaka asked him, “Is this my vessel or yours?” As Vasumitra thought it over, Machaka said, “If you consider it my vessel, yet it is your inherent nature. Then again, if it is your vessel, you should receive my teaching.” Hearing this, Vasumitra understood the uncreated fundamental nature.

Kazan’s verse: “If the frosty dawn’s bell rings as it’s struck, you never need an empty bowl. Here, this vessel, is it mine or yours?”

This collection was done by Keizan, who’s a few generations after Dogen. And it’s kind of unusual within the koan literature because it’s said to be the enlightenment experiences of all of the ancestors, beginning with the Buddha and ending with Ejo, Dogen’s—one of Dogen’s principal heirs. In the early—particularly the Indian—teachers, because there was such a paucity of information in the old tradition in India, keeping history was not evidently something that was really done or valued. And so a lot of this material that is drawn—the biographical material—as Daido Roshi used to say, this is a very esoteric collection of koans. There’s a lot of magic and supernatural stuff going on. And even the historical validity of each of these teachers in a direct line from the Buddha to Ejo and then on down to us here is in question.

But in the establishment of the lineage in Zen, as Chan was developing in China, that was very important for a number of different reasons. And so the lineage was formed. And whether each of these teachers is historically both accurate in terms of them being that person and—or whether they were actually in that line of lineage—is not really for us so important. What we do know is that the Dharma has been transmitted all the way since the time of the Buddha, through peoples in each generation, and through that very important relationship between the student and the teacher.

This vessel, is it mine or yours? Does it belong to the teacher or to the student?

Teachings sometimes talk about being a vessel of the Dharma. Oftentimes that means the teacher recognizes that a student may have the capacity—not only to realize themselves, but to become a Dharma holder, a lineage holder, a teacher. In a larger sense, being a vessel of the Dharma is each of you having found your way to the Dharma, having sought that out, having done some good things in your life such that that was possible. And practicing means that vessel is alive and well.

In the Uttaratantra Shastra, which is a teaching on Buddha Nature, it says, “The perfect Buddha-kaya, kaya’s vessel, vehicle, the perfect Buddha-kaya, is all-embracing. Suchness cannot be differentiated, and all beings have the disposition. Thus, they always have Buddha Nature. The Buddha has said that all beings have Buddha Nature. Why? Since Buddha wisdom is always present within the assembly of beings, since this undefiled nature is free from duality, and since the disposition to Buddhahood has been named after its fruit, it’s all-embracing. It reaches everywhere. Nothing is forsaken.” Because that nature which we all possess has no boundary inside or outside. It can’t be inclusive or exclusive. It can’t accept or reject. It cannot be differentiated because it is one nature, like the great ocean, like the boundless sky, and sentient beings have the disposition.

How do we know that? Here you are. And yet, as I said the other day, a few things need to be taken care of.

So Vasumitra was the successor of Machaka. This is very early—this is the eighth ancestor from the Buddha. When he meets him, it’s said that Vasumitra, when he was young, had a wine vessel that he carried everywhere. And so when he met Machaka, he had the wine vessel, and he said, “Do you know what I have in my hand?” Does Vasumitra know what he has in his hand?

When we enter the path, do we know what the vessel is that we are bringing into this journey? Is it my body? Is it my mind? Is it my feelings? Is it my memories and beliefs? My personality? We inhabit, can inhabit, all that we take as ourselves so carelessly, and yet when we die, we sure don’t want to lose it. It’s the seed of our dis-ease, and yet we cherish it. We want to be free within it, yet we can put up a good fight to let go.

Keizan said, “Even if you understand that mind is the way and body is Buddha, this is still a defiled vessel. And being a defiled vessel, it is inappropriate for the Pure.” Pure here means—it doesn’t mean being, you know, a saint or sanctimonious; it means free, awake, clear. He says, “You may understand that it encompasses all of time. And you may know that it is forever complete,” which is all true, “but this is still a defiled vessel. What past or present are you talking about? What beginning or end are you talking about? Views like this are inappropriate for the Pure.”

In other words, as we become more clear, we understand that beginning and end, past and present and future, right and wrong, are what the Buddha called convenient designations—ways to refer to things that we experience in the world and that we can speak about, right? And so we are given a name, so that when we want to call out to someone, we can say—we don’t have to say, “You, third from the right.” But then we mistake the name. We mistake the nouns, the words, for creating or being a definite thing, self-existing. And so he says, this view is not appropriate for the Pure, for one who has seen through that. And then we can use those words, use those terms. We can tell stories. We can tell our own stories and not be fooled, not be deceived by them into thinking, “That’s who I am. That’s who I was. This is the absolute truth.”

You know, more and more, as I have—I was thinking of, as I was getting ready for this earlier, of wanting to talk about student, teacher, and sort of, you know, raising bodhicitta. The beginnings of that stirring that happens within each seeker of the Way, each seeker of the Dharma. And I remember, I was in my room, which I shared with my brother—my beloved older brother, about a year older. And we were doing homework. And I don’t know what precipitated it, but we just started talking, and he started talking, and he was just sharing things he had been thinking about and sort of ways he had been seeing things. And I remember just feeling like scales were just falling, and that I was like—he was like—I just felt like he was opening up a world that was really just beginning to think about things, rather than just, you know, being a teenager and that.

You know, it’s like being a teenager, being in my life, thinking about things, like, “It’s happening, it’s now, I’m involved in it. What is it?” And so it was like that beginning, you know? I mean, there had been stirrings and mostly just feelings of, like, you know, discontent. But that was the first moment where I felt like, really, he was sort of quite unwittingly and innocently introducing me to thinking, examining.

I remember years later, we were—I was in LA visiting him on my way back from New Zealand, where he used to live. He used to live in Los Angeles. And we were out walking and I was telling him this story. And it was like, you know, like, “Oh my God, man, you, like, did this for me. And it’s like, I love you.” And he was like, “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And it didn’t matter, you know? And it was like, how often has somebody done something for us and they have no idea? We might not even know in that moment the impact of what happened. But later, as we were—I mean, I think of teachers who were so important to me and who I would be fighting with and resisting, you know, but they cared. And they were in there, like, holding my feet to the fire about something related to my schoolwork, and I was resisting, but they got to me, right? They didn’t know that.

So that’s why it’s always important to just practice, give. What is our aspiration? Why is that so important in Buddhist practice? Why is there so much emphasis on raising bodhicitta? Is it just to remind us that our practice shouldn’t be just for ourselves, but should also be for others? But bodhicitta is not just, you know, an intention to realize ourself, an intention to help others. Where does that come from? What is causing that to be aroused? That’s aspiration. That’s the seat of bodhicitta.

That’s why when somebody wants to enter into formal training, Daido Roshi years ago realized it’s important to, in a sense, slow things down and create what he called barrier gates, right? To stop and to be asked questions, to reflect, to try and get clear. You don’t have to do this, right? Why do you want to do this? What are you seeking? What is motivating you? What do you think this is? So that when we enter, our eyes are at least half open.

In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, it talks about being pure, not being pure. Shariputra asks the Buddha, “Undefiled, O Lord, is purity. Being undefiled is purity.” There’s an interesting way that the sutra sometimes works, where there’s kind of a calling and responding, a singing and singing back that goes back and forth. And so Shariputra sings out, “Undefiled, O Lord, is purity.” And the Buddha responds, “Because of the absolute absence of all defilement.” Shariputra says, “Through the non-defilement—of what? Of what is there purity?” And the Buddha says, “The purity results from the fact that form, sensations, perceptions, mental formations, consciousness, are in their essence, original nature, free from defilement. Thus there’s purity, free from defilement, free from anything that constricts, confines, limits. That’s our nature.”

So Daido Roshi, in this setting up of the gates, established what he called Zen study, or as a way of talking about studying with a teacher. That part of what a lineage means is that every teacher has a teacher. And that doesn’t end when the teacher dies. I still have a teacher, right? When we form a relationship with somebody, particularly one that’s significant, that doesn’t end if and when the person’s life ends—it just changes its shape, changes its form. And so what is the teacher meeting the student, the student meeting the teacher?

Dogen, in his fascicle on face-to-face transmission, says, “Shakyamuni Buddha saw Mahakashyapa in person. Mahakashyapa saw the Venerable Ananda in person. And Ananda bowed formally to Mahakashyapa’s Buddha face. This is face-to-face transmission. Ananda maintained this face-to-face transmission, closely guided Shanavasa, his disciple, and transmitted face-to-face. When Shanavasa respectfully saw Venerable Ananda, he received face-to-face transmission—just face-to-face.”

So when we talk about face-to-face teaching, right, we are sitting face-to-face. But Dogen is looking at this in a very deep way, in an important way. It’s not just that we happen to be in the same room facing each other. There’s something happening. Shakyamuni Buddha saw Mahakashyapa in person. He could have never known what that means. Now, right—post-COVID, Zoom—of course he means it in a very particular way. He doesn’t just mean that we’re actually sitting in the same room. Thank you for that. But he’s saying he saw Mahakashyapa in person. Buddha saw Mahakashyapa. Buddha saw Mahapajapati in person, in person. The teacher sees the student in person. The student trains so that they might see the teacher in person, that they might see themselves in person. The Buddha saw Ubiri in person, Patachara in person.

You know that story that Hojun Sensei told yesterday—that’s so compelling, so overwhelming to think of such a cascade of tragedy. What more could there be? How could you not lose your mind? And when the Buddha met her, clearly he was not afraid. He was not overwhelmed with her grief. He was not intimidated by her grief. He clearly was not deceived into thinking that his job was to fix her. He said, “Patachara, come to your senses. It’s time. It’s time.” He knew the reality of grief. He knew its cause. He knew its potential for cessation, and he knew the path. He just presented that to her in a way that got through.

In the gates, in this chapter on Zen study, Daido Roshi talks about how we create a sense of self, and that self becomes our barrier and says, “The ego shell is the barrier and we must become it and realize itself.” In other words, we can’t keep separating ourselves from the barrier, which is what we do when we grab onto it. What we do when we reject certain aspects of ourself, we just make it stronger. To realize the barrier is the self is to realize the self. The barrier then becomes you. You become the barrier and there’s nothing else. Or realize—we just really, we just realize that there’s nothing really there. This is the self teaching the self. This is the self realizing the self.

And then he says, “Isn’t this what Dogen is talking about in the Mountains and Rivers Sutra?” He says, “Since ancient times, wise ones and sages have lived by the water.” Sometimes this teacher is referred to as being somebody who fishes and fishes for a student, throws out a hook and tries to catch a student. When they live by the water, they catch fish, or they catch humans, or they catch the Way. These are all traditional water styles. And going further, they must be catching the self, catching the hook, being caught by the hook, being caught by the Way.

In ancient times, when Chuang Tzu suddenly left Huishan and went to live on the river, he caught the sage of the flower and river who was living by the river. Isn’t this catching fish? Isn’t it catching humans, catching water? Is it not catching oneself?

And then he goes on to say, “My teacher meeting me is my teacher meeting himself. It is me meeting myself. Isn’t this the Buddha meeting the Buddha? Isn’t this my teaching? You meeting myself, you meeting yourself, and the Buddha seeing himself.” We say that to realize oneself is to be intimate with oneself. To be intimate with oneself is Buddha realizing Buddha. This action verifies and actualizes the enlightenment of all the Buddhas in the ten directions. That’s what is meant by face-to-face transmission and that it’s experiential, right? It’s not information, it’s not knowledge.

I told the story that Daido Roshi told, when he was at the temple years ago—probably before the temple, I don’t remember—but he was doing a retreat. Everybody was sitting in a circle and somebody was asking about transmission and said, “Well, you know, but it’s like when you tell somebody something, that message, and then that message is told to the next person, next person. It breaks down, you know, like the telephone game. You tell somebody something that by the time it comes back, it’s almost unrecognizable.” And he said, “No, it’s not like that.” And they said, “What’s it like?” And he slapped the person next to him and he said, “Pass that around.” So everybody slapped each person. When it came back to him, he said, “Yeah, it’s intact.” If it were only that easy.

But what is the toll? What is being sacrificed when we do not meet? When we do not meet the teacher, we do not meet ourselves. Can we prevent the teacher from seeing ourselves? I remember years ago, I had a new student. This was very early in my teaching, and he had just done tankan. And I don’t know if it was actually during shoken, when he was asking for the teachings or the first interview after that—I don’t remember. But it was a normal interview—you know, talked a little bit about practice. And then afterwards he sent a letter and he said, “I quit.” He said, “There’s no way that this can ever work, that you can ever actually be my teacher, unless we spend—basically the implication—we have to spend lots and lots of times hanging out together, talking to each other. You have to know my story. I have to tell my story. That’s obviously not going to happen. In a few minutes, I’m out.” Okay? He was right that none of that stuff was going to happen, or not in the way he thought. But what is lost when we do not meet?

Is there a difference between meeting our teacher, meeting ourselves, and meeting a spring day, meeting a task, meeting a prostration, meeting a Buddha? That’s what we call dukkha—not meeting. We call it samsara. We call it pain and confusion. We call it “Time swiftly passes by and opportunities are lost.”

You know, one of the things I love about living in the Northeast—I mean, we had seasons in the South, but they were, you know, more subtle—is that they’re more vivid, right? Each season is its own living creation. And so each season, you know, I sort of mark the firsts, like with spring: the first night when I’m walking back to the abbacy and I hear the spring peepers—that first night; the first day—last Sunday—the windows are open in the zendo, the first tick—I’ve already had mine; the first flowers, the first crocus, the first daffodil. Isn’t it wholly appropriate—it would make me believe in God—that the daffodil, one of the first flowers, is such an incredibly happy flower? I mean, is there a happier flower than a daffodil? You never see it, like, sad. The first spring rain, the birds returning, all of those firsts. And yet, do we meet them? Do they get under our skin? Do we see what’s happening?

Dogen said, “Thus the authentic ancestors of all generations have continued face-to-face transmission—disciple seeing teacher, teacher seeing disciple. An ancestor, a teacher or a disciple cannot be a Buddha or an ancestor without having face-to-face transmission. It’s like pouring water into the ocean and spreading it endlessly, or like transmitting the lamp and allowing it to shine forever. In thousands of millions of transmissions, the trunk and branches are one. Breaking an eggshell by pecking from the inside and outside at once.” Referring to the image of a hen pecking at the egg—peck, peck, peck—and the egg inside—duck, duck, tuck, peck, peck, peck, duck, tuck, tuck—and finally it cracks open and a new life has come.

And so this, he says, is face-to-face transmission and that this is how we are here now. And we can think of this in terms of formal transmission. But what he’s talking about is that, but it’s also every moment in which the Dharma is being conveyed, being received, being experienced. Sometimes we know that that’s happening, oftentimes we don’t—not in the moment; we don’t know. That becomes clear later. Disciple seeing the teacher, teacher seeing disciple.

We don’t use that term so much—a disciple. It’s a nice term. It means a follower, a student, a believer, an adherent—so not all of those really fully apply. A follower of the way. I don’t think of it so much as following a teacher. It’s not so much based in belief. I was thinking, is it kind of like being an apprentice? You know, in the age-old tradition, you know, apprentice studying with a master craftsman, somebody who has great skill—seamstress. The definition of an apprentice is a person who’s learning a trade from a skilled employer, having agreed to work for a fixed period at low wages. Well, they got that right.

And I was thinking of when I was a music student, oftentimes when I was working on a piece, I would play, then my teacher would say, “Wait.” And then he would play it. He’d say, “Now you play it.” Then I would play. He’d say, “No, listen, listen.” And then he would play it again—calling and answering, calling and answering. So there’s following example, there’s a modeling, but when I played, it was me playing. He wasn’t saying, “Imitate me,” he was saying, “Listen to the music.” He was the vehicle by which the music was coming. He said, “Listen to the music and let the music come out. Let it come from you, let it come from me, and let it be true to the music.”

I was thinking also, when I was studying composition, so traditionally, one of the ways you learn is you learn to write in the style—in the style of Bach, style of Mozart. So you study their writings and you write in the style, but you’re not trying to imitate them. How could you? But you’re writing in the style of. It’s very similar. It has to come from one’s heart. It’s not imitating, but it’s also trying to stay true to the style. And I thought, isn’t that very similar to what we’re doing? We’re trying to stay true to the Dharma because that’s the path that we can rely on, that we take refuge in, but it has to come from within.

When we study with a teacher, we’re following examples. I definitely followed the example of my teacher, and I learned from all of his positive qualities, and I also learned from some of his difficult qualities, right? And every teacher teaches in terms of, you know, the ways in which the Dharma manifests well and also through their imperfections. I remember saying to a new student recently, “I will disappoint you.” And they looked at me like—I said, “No, really, not because I intend to, but because that is going to happen.” We all have expectations. We all have certain ideals, idealizations. It’s actually an important part of it.

And so to follow a teacher is to follow the path, to follow the Buddha Dharma so that we can begin to meet. Isn’t that what’s happening in zazen? Face-to-face, your face meeting your face. And so in practicing, we enter into the mindstream of the Buddha, of these ancestors. In every koan, we’re entering into the mindstream of these teachers. In studying with a teacher, we’re studying, we’re entering into their mindstream, and the teacher is entering into the mindstream of the students.

In the very early years, when Daido Roshi was establishing and teaching and setting things up, and as he said, just doing it like it’s going to happen, like it is happening, we were entering into his—not only his mindstream, but his vision, what he was trying to do, what he wanted to do, what he was trying to create. I didn’t know. We didn’t know. He called it a monastery. Okay, right. He talked about these various forms of training. Okay, right. So, you know, I learned how to do these different things, but I didn’t really know. I didn’t have his mind. I didn’t experience his training. And at every step along the way. And I think an important part of why he set up the gates was he wanted there to be examination and discernment. Don’t just do this stuff. We don’t just bow because the—we do just bow when the bell rings. Just bow. And we don’t just bow when the bell rings, right? In other words, what are we doing? Not analyzing it to death, thinking it to death, parsing it out and dissecting it and pinning it to a board, but bringing it to life. What is it in here?

So in a sense, I am the apprentice. I am following the examples of my teachers. They did prostrations. Okay, I do a prostration. I don’t really know what that is. My body seems to be able to follow that fairly well. That’s part of it. But am I meeting the prostration? When we’re involved in any practice that feels somewhat empty—that’s the gap. Whether it’s actively through resistance, whether it’s because we want to try and figure it out and we don’t, we can’t, or whether it’s just because we haven’t yet met it. And I imagine many, if not most of you, have had an experience where you had an experience of some simple aspect of practice that got in, that entered in, and you experienced something you feel. I’m not talking about enlightenment. I’m just talking about something was touched, something true, a string was plucked, and it was in tune. That’s the transmission happening.

Is this my vessel or your vessel? As Vasumitra was thinking that—it is neither I nor—it’s not mine or it’s not yours. Machaka said, “If you think it’s my vessel, but you have Buddha Nature, so it wasn’t Machaka’s vessel. But then again, if it’s your vessel, why are you here?” He said, “Then you should receive my teaching.” Therefore, it wasn’t Vasumitra’s vessel either. It’s not my vessel. It’s not your vessel. So the vessel itself is not a vessel. This is why the vessel disappears.

This is what is happening in training, that the student and teacher, facing each other, sitting apart, one guiding the other, begins to merge. The mind is known, right? It’s like, how can the teacher know a student’s experience? They’re not experiencing their experience. They need to have had certain experiences to be clear about that and then to be able to see when that is being expressed through the body, through the words, through the eyes, through actions, through what is said, through what is not said—until the vessel is no longer a vessel.

This is why patience is so important, you know, and maybe we should really—I think we should actually really factor in, when we think about, why is this difficult, why does it take so long, blah, blah, blah. You know, we’ve all had that, perhaps are having that particular conversation. Maybe we should throw into that pot the fact that we live in a culture which in some ways is so anti-training, right? It’s anti-patience. No patience for patience. It’s transactional. You better be getting something for your money, right? And that we absorb that, right? We grow up in that—if we grew up in this country—and the aggrandizement, the enshrining of the self, the enshrining of the ego, right? And so that’s got to be playing a role.

I was thinking about how we’ve talked recently on a couple occasions about how in the early days when the dokusan line was called “running,” right—helter-skelter, leaping over people, and there was, you know, there were some problems, right? People who weren’t so fast always ended up at the end of the line. Sometimes people got bumped a little. Some people’s enthusiasm became aggression, you know, or just like, “me first,” you know, crowding somebody out. And so we started to temper that a little bit, and I think that was appropriate. And something was lost.

You know, I got to tell you, when I sit here and I hear the daisan line called and I see some people getting up, and it’s like, you think you’re going to live forever. Are you going to a chat? Are you going to have a cup of coffee? Is your head on fire? You don’t have to knock somebody down. But part of what that was doing was instilling, bringing—it was either just expressing what was already there or was helping to bring forth a sense of urgency.

I remember doing—I think when Shohan talked recently, or maybe it was in Yermondo, about when the Buddha came upon the ascetics and they referred to him as “friend,” and he said he had to reorient him. Our relationship has changed. He was saying, all right. And then I remember doing dokusan—I think it was during an introductory retreat—and some young or maybe a new resident came in and sat down and goes, “What’s up?” I was like, “Where to begin?”

Oh, the blessed bell speaks volumes, raises questions. It’s not a chat. It’s not a discussion. I never went to dokusan—even the very last time, when I thought, this is probably the last time I’m going to see my teacher in this room after all of these years—I never went in casual. I was always sitting at the edge of my seat, always ready, always with some degree of question, “How can I use this? How can I meet this to be a student?” You know, that question of the question.

And I want to think about that a little bit in terms of how we introduce or talk about dokusan or daisan—interview—in terms of—because sometimes when I’m talking to people, they seem to have the sense that they need a question, or the question, you know, it’s like there’s the right question and you better get to it. Sometimes people will come in and say, “You know, I don’t really have anything important to say,” and then they’ll ask something which is actually very important. Sometimes setting it up that way can create a sense of, you know, an idea of something. It comes from within.

As Dharma practitioners, we’re studying the Way, which means self, other, karma, impermanence, death, conflict, fear, joy, impatience—everything, phenomena and that. To want to know, to want to understand, to want to meet, to want to live this life and not just have passed through it, to not want to miss this opportunity that I have been given, that you have been given—that is the fire on top of the head. When you have a fire in your head, you’re not going to put it off till tomorrow, right? That’s not even a question. You’re not going to think, “You know, I was really on my way to something. This is most inconvenient.” It takes—it assumes its place. And that’s a really essential part of practice, is making contact with what is important.

And there are many things in our lives that are important—our families, the people we love, the work that we do, our blessed earth, our time, power and misuse of power. There are many things that are important. Is there anything that unifies all of them? Is there anything that runs through all of them? Is there an undercurrent? Is there something that permeates them? Not in terms of an ultimate solution, but in terms of you, me, living in this world with all of these important matters. Is it just a matter of going from one thing to the next and completing tasks? Is there something I want to know? Is there something you want to know? Is there something, a way you want to be in this life, a sense of it?

I was just reading earlier in this Prajnaparamita Sutra, there’s a passage where Shariputra asks the Buddha, “If someone encounters the Dharma in this lifetime and really is drawn to it, has an affinity and begins to practice, does that mean that in a previous lifetime, in the teaching of rebirth, in a previous lifetime, that something happened, something particular happened?” The Buddha said, “Oh, yes. It means that in a previous lifetime they encountered the Dharma. And they didn’t just encounter it, but they examined it.” He makes this very clear point. “And they examined it,” he says, “with Maitreya, with the Buddha of the future, with the teacher. And then they counter-examined. They didn’t just ask a question and got their answers and said, ‘Okay, thanks.’ They counter-examined.” In other words, they continued to examine, they continued to want to know, they continued to question, right? What? That’s what lies in the heart of that student. That is what we can speak of as the great matter of—she spoke of the spiritual imperative, but those are words.

Is there any person who doesn’t on some level know that they’re going to die? Knowing that they’re going to die, how can that not bring up the question on some level of, what is this? What is this then, right? Something about recognizing mortality brings that finite lifespan into question, as it should. And then what? And then what? What do we do with that? It’s in a way an inconvenient truth, right? It’s an inconvenient—it’s uncomfortable. It doesn’t have a ready-made answer, right? Nobody’s standing outside the door ready to resolve this for you. We actually have to leave home, like the Buddha did. We have to leave, we have to be discontented and not only abide by that, but actually increase it.

The teachings say, you cannot actually do this without adversity—which might seem like a bold statement. From the Buddhist perspective, it’s just truth, it’s just fact. It’s not an opinion. The nature of human beings is that we need to understand what we’re in the midst of in order to begin to wonder, to want to know, to see. And that that urge is inherent within human beings—maybe it exists in other creatures. Maybe they work it out in their own way. Maybe it’s worked out from the beginning and it just doesn’t arise. But it sure as hell isn’t like that for us. And that’s a good thing, because then we can seek, we can encounter, we can practice.

Dogen said, “It is like pouring water into the ocean and spreading it endlessly, or like transmitting the lamp and allowing it to shine forever. In thousands of millions of transmissions, the trunk and branches are one.” They’re one.

We can think about different moments in our lives that might have been important, influential, like I described with my brother. That might have been shifting moments—something changed suddenly. We were actually turned towards the Dharma. Like in the Lotus Sutra. The child who leaves home and is a vagabond and is becoming more and more destitute, right? All the while left a home of riches. And the Lotus Sutra simply says, “One day they turned back in the direction of their home.” And that is one of my most favorite lines in all of the sutras. It’s so unassuming, it doesn’t explain, there are no fireworks. But in that, one day, they just turned in the direction of home. That is full, like pouring water into the ocean.

This is why the Buddha in the Prajnaparamita Sutra said, “I have so much gratitude to wisdom.” Think of that. We think of realizing it, practicing accord with it, having faith in it. But the Buddha in the sutra says, “I am so grateful for wisdom, because it is by virtue of wisdom that everything that has happened here is happening here, has come forth.” So how do we express our gratitude? I think you know.

37838,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-04-25 12:59","BA28","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Skillful Means In The Forms Of Practice","","Upaya—Skillful means—forms that the teachings take, reflecting their appropriateness to the circumstances in which they appear. It's from the Agates glossary: Upaya, skillful means, forms that the teachings take, reflecting their appropriateness to the circumstances in which they appear.

I was thinking about Upaya this week. Skillful means: how we discover what is skillful and what is unskillful in moving our awakened nature into beneficial action. How are we a beneficial creation out of this uncreated moment to moment?

So our Ango theme is Mountain Training, the Eight Gates of Zen. I feel like I've been meeting Daido Roshi a lot this Ango—studying the eight Gates, listening to his talks, rereading his books—and how the teacher keeps teaching even though their form has changed. Still, his skillful means are very active. And if, maybe, we understand skillful means as the teachings—skillful means for what? In the Buddha Dharma, it's for liberating the clinging mind from suffering. And the Eight Gates of Zen is entering the skillful means of Daido Roshi's expression. He would say there's actually no gates—no gates, just one body, one mind, one life, one heart, one realization. But we look into these areas of focus to develop our skills, arousing and protecting bodhicitta, to see where we turn away and can turn towards not making harm, practicing good, cultivating good for others, strengthening our aspiration to be of benefit to ourselves, to others. Liberating the clinging mind.

And don't we see it in all the skillful means offered? I mean, just—how many of you ring a bell? Where do you find yourself being a server, an usher? What arises as you're doing your service position? One of our students wrote a book about the Greek language, and she began with this word, ginosko, which means to come to know, the recognition of what is true by experience.

I was reading this book on contemporary artists who practice the Buddha Dharma, and I really enjoyed this essay by Robert Thurman. He takes us back to the time of the Buddha where he started to realize this need for skillful means. Say you are—he says—say you are a Buddha and you're free of suffering and you feel totally great, as happy as a bee, happy as a clam, at one with the universe. And then you see all these miserable people. What good would it do for you to go and give them a big grin and a hug or smother them with joyfulness? They'll just get freaked out and paranoid and say, ""What does that person want?"" So instead, a Buddha has to develop some strategies, some art, to first of all open that person's imagination to the fact that there is a world where they don't have to be miserable all the time. And then they have to help them with a method of how to move from their paranoid corner of misery into the great ocean of bliss of the universe that you, a Buddha, perceive.

Now, as you know, the Buddha began then—so he says, in a sense, none of what Buddha expressed was driven by any sort of selfish impulse on the part of the being that was formerly Siddhartha Gautama. Everything he does is a communication of compassion to other beings, creating doorways to open up their imaginations and their whole beings to enlightenment, to Nirvana, to peace. So to first present Nirvana as a work of art allows people to perceive it and opens up the possibility that they can experience it for themselves. Who would want to seek Nirvana or peace if they couldn't imagine there was such a state of freedom from suffering?

So the Buddha's first talk was on the Prajna Paramita. And if you remember, it was written in the Lotus Sutra that he talked about the emptiness of everything—the no-thingness. And 5,000 monks, nuns, and lay people left. One scholar called it the Heart Attack Sutra. Some people even had heart attacks because it was just going. They couldn't bear to have it be so laid bare that nothing was fixed or permanent in such a way. And Shariputra saw everyone leaving and said to the Buddha, ""What should we do? How should we get everybody back here?"" And Buddha said, ""Let them go, let them go."" And then he looked again and he said, ""Let me start with the Four Noble Truths. Hey, everybody, life suffers."" Boom. We're all there. And that suffering is from dukkha, from thirst, from dissatisfaction, from not having what we want or having something and we want to get rid of it, to spinning in that. And then he said, the good news is we can put an end to that suffering. And he laid out the Eightfold Path of right views or perfect views, right determination, right speech, right ethics, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

In the Avatamsaka Sutra, it says, ""Mind is like an artist, able to paint the worlds. The five clusters are all born thence. There's nothing it doesn't make. As is the mind, so is the Buddha; as is the Buddha, so are living beings. Know that Buddha and mind are in essence inexhaustible. If people know the actions of mind create all worlds, they will see the Buddha and understand the Buddha's true nature.""

So we know of all the many unskillful, unexamined desires, strong attachments and tendencies we're starting to know or become familiar with in ourselves that cause trouble, stress, create harm for ourselves, for others. And we definitely need to learn skills guiding our alertness and our goodwill. And this is why all of the Buddhist teachings are considered to be skillful means, because they're part of our refuge, as I spoke of before, to protect ourselves from our own lack of skill. How generous. How generous. He could have just gone off happy as a clam.

As we continue on our Bodhisattva path to Buddhahood, Daido cautioned us against believing that we have all the answers, that we know what is actually skillful for someone else, even as we're learning what's skillful for us. He railed against arrogance, making someone disempowered in the name of skillful means. And we know Buddhist communities continue to grapple with leaders considered to be enlightened, using skillful means and taking advantage of their power dynamic. So that's been there throughout history, and we can be grateful to the Buddha and the ancestors for sharing with us what they worked through and taught.

You don't have to starve yourself and be an ascetic to realize your true nature. The Buddha said, don't do that. You don't have to do that. You can nourish. You need this body. It's your vehicle. Bankei says you don't have to push so hard to make yourself sick and then keep going and make yourself sicker. Don't let your Zen sickness be interfering.

Rengetsu showed us it was skillful to have a moving meditation when deeply grief-stricken, that the skillful way is to be absolutely, irredeemably heartbroken and not try and hold it together. She said, we can do that. It's exhausting and everyone can feel it, so we're not doing anyone a favor. She skillfully showed how to know that grief moves and not to solidify in stories about it.

So, skillful means—does it take something to make it skillful? Is it art practice, body practice, liturgy, face-to-face teaching? Is that skillful means in and of itself, or does it need us, our energy, our wisdom, our power to ignite it, to make it skillful? So we have a schedule. We get up at 3:50. Is that skillful for you? You knew that before you came here. You weren't straightjacketed into sesshin, so why fight it? You wanted this on some level—you knew it wasn't going to change. So what do you sit there? Why do we have to get up at 3:50? It's like ridiculous. So what does it take to make it skillful? Why is it happening? Why did you choose it? There's many things like that. We can go on and on.

Daido always used to say, you know, don't have this attitude like—just because you take your seat of zazen, you don't just throw, you know, sit there and lower your eyes and say, ""Okay, do me. Anything happening yet?"" He said, forget about it. In order for it to function, it needs to be discovered, engaged, applied, tested, and developed. And this is not just once. We're constantly having to work this like a piece of clay, molding it into a form. What's skillful? What do we keep? What's not helpful?

When the mind is free of attachment and delusion, its actions are effortlessly creative, perfectly tuned to the moment, just like the universe itself.

I was thinking of Shugen Roshi spoke about Yubiri and how the Buddha, after she had this grief and Buddha opened her up, you know, ""Come to your senses."" I was thinking of Patacara and the skill that the Buddha used with her. And there are lots of stories throughout the literature—we all know this. It's all skillful means. Every koan is skillful means, getting us to realize.

So, Patacara—her story was: she was a mother, had a child, and she was going to have a second child. And the custom is to go to your parents' house. So she was on the way to the home and a storm came up and she was very close to giving birth. In fact, it was time. Along with the storm, her water broke. So her husband went to get some branches to build a shelter and he was bitten by a poisonous snake and died. But she didn't know it because she crawled into a hollow tree and gave birth. It was only the next day that she searched for him and found him and saw that he had died.

So she decided to continue on to her parents' house. But she had to cross this river that was overflowing, and so she was going to take one child at a time to cross. So she took her newborn infant across and laid it in the bushes. And then she went to get the next child on the other shore when she saw a hawk come and pick up her child and carry it off. And as she screamed, the other child thought that was the cue to come and stepped into the water and was taken away. So that's a husband and two children within a few days.

And she continued on to her parents' house and met someone on the way from that village. And they said, ""In that storm last night there was a fire. And I'm sorry, your whole family was taken in that fire."" Needless to say, can you imagine her state of mind? And she just kept wandering, wandering after that, just not even taking care of herself, just wandering, wandering.

Unbeknownst to her, she came upon the Jeta Grove where the Buddha was teaching. And his disciples found her very frightening and appalling, a pariah. And the Buddha saw her, and they said, ""Let her be."" And he rose and he followed, and he placed himself in her path. And when they met, he said, ""Sister, it is time to recover your presence of mind. Come to your senses."" At that moment, it was like an electric shock for her. She was ready, and she came to her senses. And she realized she had nothing on. She took a cloak and covered her body. And she asked the Buddha to help her.

It's easy to say that maybe the Buddha did something, gave her something. Perhaps she heard not simply the words of Shakyamuni Buddha, but she heard that timeless Buddha voice which calls to each of us to wake up, to recover our presence of mind. What happens when we recognize no one can help us to come home? We have all the means because we've never left. When we unreservedly trust into the truth of that boundless mind itself.

I would say she emptied herself of her games, her illusion, so completely she could hear what was done. She was cleaned out. She found trust beyond any knowing and measure, direct to the heart. Patacara was freed. And then, after listening to her tragic story, Buddha told her, throughout many lives, she had shed more tears for the loss of loved ones than there was water in the oceans. I feel like that was a real critical part of the story that he said, that that was so skillful—that she was recognized, that she was met in her suffering. The Buddha reminded her, ""At your death, even if they had all been living, your family could only look on in helpless despair. Only the Dharma can help you."" And hearing this, she decided to ordain and was taken into the nuns' community, which welcomed her. And she became a teacher. And she used what she had been through as her skillful means in her teachings. Recognition of what is true by experience.

As is this fusatsu, a renewal of our vows—primarily to have the opportunity to atone, be at one, be not separate from our harmful karma, our intentional actions, separation we have created from beginningless beginning. And to recommit, to be guided by the precepts. So this ceremony, too, goes back to the time of the Buddha. How generous—we can atone for our harmful actions. And Buddha created this ceremony. What a way to spend a Friday night. ""All harmful karma ever created by me since of old on account of my beginningless greed, anger and ignorance, born of my body, mouth and thought—now I'm at one with it all.""

Maezumi Roshi says—he talks about ceremonial action. And he said the Latin word for ceremony is ""caramonia,"" which is related to ""cura,"" meaning cure, the act of healing or being healed. In other words, he says, ceremony is an act that cures or heals, or by which something is healed. And then he throws in his little, ""We must ask, what is healed by what?""

As I was working on this, I was thinking of Daido's skillful means, of how we can connect with Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva—Namu being one with Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. And he initiated an art practice to connect with Avalokiteshvara. Each of us had to study: what are the qualities of that Bodhisattva and find them within ourselves and then create something. And then he had us do this creative audience one day. So we got in groups of five. He loved to do this creative audience. And somebody brought this little sculpture they did. So we all did the process. He took us through relaxing every muscle from the head down to the toe, just becoming aware of each part of your body and relaxing it. And then taking a flash look, closing your eyes and seeing what the after-image was like. And then going into the art a little bit more.

And so we were all doing this sculpture and then we give our responses. And some people are saying, like, ""I started to get a headache and my throat was really tight."" And the next person saying, ""I felt like I was being pressed and I couldn't move and I felt heat in my cheeks."" And, like, everyone in the circle was sort of... And the person that made it was visibly getting quite angry. This is—this is their Avalokiteshvara, and we're all saying, ""I feel tight. I feel like I'm choking. I can't move, move."" And so he finally stands up and he says, ""You people are nuts,"" and he tears out of there.

And so we start processing what happened. We were just doing it. It wasn't about him. We were just... And then in a few minutes, he returned and he says, ""You know what? I was working on that up in the cabin and there was no heat, and it was 7 o'clock in the morning. And all I did while I worked was curse the monastery, curse art practice, wonder why I'm here as I'm sculpting this."" That's what we got. That's what we got.

And Daido used to say, we're always creating something. The question is—what? How aware are we of our actions and what we are expressing? He also shared one time he got in a big fight in his company because they were—he was in a chemical company and they were pouring stuff out into the river. And he got in a big fight with everyone in the office and he stormed out. And he was coming home, and he had his camera as usual, and he saw some graffiti on these rocks. So he parked the car and he's fuming. He said he's driving along and he's just going over the whole thing and he's angry with everyone and going over the whole situation. And then he starts photographing this graffiti on the rocks. And he realizes he's lightening up and he's getting a little lighter. And he felt pretty pleased with himself and how the day ended and developed these images and had them on slides.

He said he had a date that night. He thought, that's what I'll do. I'll make dinner and I'll show these pictures I created. And so he does that. And as they're sitting there, he looks over at her and there's tears running down her face. And so he finishes and she says, ""That was horrible. That was really painful."" He thought this was the best thing he did, you know, and he realized—he said that was the first time he realized, as he says, ""An unexamined mind is a dangerous one."" That he didn't know he was working out what happened at the office. And that's what she was getting.

So we need to take care of our creations. Shugen Roshi gave a talk and I heard this thing—he said, ""Don't put the handle of creation in someone else's hands. Create good karmic roots."" Karma simply means intentional action. Simply. There's a lot on karma—this relationship between what we choose to do and then what we make of ourselves, how we shape ourselves and how we're shaped by ourselves through actions, moment to moment, by intention. Born of my—born of your body, mouth and thought. It's very direct. We can't look around. It says, ""born of my""—nobody else's creation.

When Buddha was teaching his son Rahula, he said—this is like, can you imagine your dad sitting you down and saying this? I was trying to imagine that—""Look at your actions before you act. Look at your intentions. If you think that what you're going to do or say or think is harmful, unskillful, you've got to tell yourself, 'No, don't do that.' If you don't foresee any harm, then you can do it. If while you're doing it, you see that some harm is happening that you didn't anticipate, you stop. Otherwise, you keep on doing it. Then when you're done, you reflect on the long-term consequences of your actions. If you see that there was any unforeseen harm, then you resolve not to repeat it, not to repeat that mistake again. If you don't see that there is any harm, then you can take joy in the fact that you're training the mind well and you haven't harmed anybody at all.""

So what qualities do we personally need to be developing? What qualities need to be abandoned? This is part of what the Buddha called the customs of the noble ones, that we learn how to delight—he said, ""in abandoning whatever we have to abandon and to delight""—interesting, he uses that word—""to delight in developing whatever needs to be developed."" Can we delight in abandoning what we need to abandon and delight in developing what we need to develop? We take delight in development in wisdom, and we support each other in such a way. This is said to be how we purify our actions and where we have to begin.

And I'll close with Daido Roshi's words:

So please, when you practice, practice skillfully, practice your life. Trust yourself completely. Trust the process of sitting. Know that deep within each and every one of us, under layers of conditioning, there is an enlightened being, alive and well. In order to function, it needs to be discovered. To discover this Buddha is wisdom. To make it function in the world is compassion. That wisdom and compassion is the life of each one of us. It's up to you what you do with it.

Thanks so much for listening.

On the Great Road of Buddha ancestors, there is always unsurpassable practice, continuous and sustained. It forms the circle of the Way and it is never cut off. Between aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana, there is not a moment's gap. Continuous practice is the circle of the Way. This being so, continuous practice is unstained, not forced by you or others. The power of this continuous practice confirms you as well as others. It means your practice affects the entire earth, the entire sky, in the ten directions. Although not noticed by others or by you, it is so.

This is the opening of Dogen's fascicle on Gyōji, on continuous practice or sustained practice—or another way to think about it is intentional practice.

An intriguing aspect of dukkha is that it promotes a raw honesty if we allow ourselves to deeply feel it beyond our insistence on ending or avoiding our suffering. I know when I feel the most acute pain, the most suffering, it deeply concentrates me and centers me in a way that I might not easily access under more comfortable and favorable conditions. When we thoroughly acknowledge our dissatisfaction and alienation in a given situation, we can be profoundly and painfully willing to let go of our habitual reactions to what makes us uncomfortable or fearful.

Interestingly, although we may recognize that our ways of avoidance do not ultimately help us, it is not easy, as we all know, to let them go, to let go of our safety net. The way that we habitually hide from ourselves perhaps is the entrance to a loving and generous compassion—to ourselves and others—to let go. This is the ongoing continuous practice.

On the Great Road of Buddha ancestors, there is always unsurpassable continuous practice, continuous and sustained. This is the invitation to practice that is before us.

In doing sesshin practice or other long sittings, other long forms of continuous practice, we travel on this great road of Buddha ancestors where, just as they did, we encounter our own minds with our foolishnesses, our obsessions, and in one manner or another, our self-limited and defined places we tend to live out of, sometimes not even visible to us. It's so habitual, just the water we swim in, except that it gets reflected back to us in how we live our life—sometimes just as a subtle undercurrent of disease and dissatisfaction, sometimes as obvious pain.

Those who have traveled the great road of Buddha ancestors have encountered precisely what we are encountering in our practice. They have practiced in a continuous and sustained way precisely as we practice to the best of our ability. We practice now on that great road so that we can be the ancestors for those who follow us on the road.

We can encounter our mind in action and study it, becoming aware of our thought processes with a clarity that's much more difficult to appreciate without practicing together. So practicing together offers us an encouragement with each other as we offer that encouragement to each other, and allows us to see again in a way that would be difficult for us to see just sitting in a lonely apartment or house, perhaps a cave, without an immediate sangha.

When I say together, it is not just those of us in this great room or those of us sitting at home, but we are practicing with all of those who have ever practiced in the timeless past and the timeless future. It's not that we are just connected. We are on this road together, all of us, past, present and future.

And yet at times we may feel helpless and lost, and at other times the path before us opens up and we see light. We see the freedom and open space which we know has always been there, but can be obscured and hard to find our way when we try and grasp it, reach for it. Yet Dogen says that on this road, we are all practicing the road of our Buddha ancestors. There is always unsurpassable practice. The practice you are doing is unsurpassable practice, always continuous and sustained. Always consider that our practice is always there, continuous and sustained.

Can we consider that this road that you and I are on is our practice—to journey with faith and trust in the Three Treasures? The Three Treasures as your own treasures, as your own journey within this vast great realm of this practice.

If, as Master Dogen points out, the road is always present, always before us, how does it become our road? Yours, mine? Intentionally and specifically designed, if you will, for your life. How does it fit? Because it fits so perfectly for you, it's essential to see what helps you in this practice and in your life, to really discern what is helpful and what is not helpful in our actions, in how we think about things.

I just always recall Shugen Roshi being asked a question and saying, ""Is that a helpful question to ask?"" Are we stuck someplace in our mind that we're kind of drilling into—a question that doesn't help us spend our time and energy, or are there helpful questions?

There's a thin line between ""I cannot face this at this time,"" which needs to be honored, and doing your best to go into what we are facing at this time. When we do this with an intention, a clear intention, a practice becomes intentional. The intention clarifies our lives and it arises in our faith of what we've already encountered before as our own experience. And that may not be so easy to put in a box and define so we can grasp it in a thought. It's deeper than that, it's more subtle than that, more profound than that. And perhaps outside of this practice we're not very well trained to attune to that.

I was reading an article that suggested that we live in this society which is designed to take the most precious thing that you have as a human being, your attention, your awareness, and put it out there. And the article compared it to gluttony. That as we go through our life and are exposed, if you will—expose ourselves, if you will—to what is out there, it's just like an endless feast that we keep stuffing ourselves with, with our attention to things outside us that pull us away from any sense of clarity and a noetic sense of true honesty and self-integrity.

And in a way, our society is designed that way. Our politics is designed that way. Our entertainment. It's almost amusing when you open a web page—so you're looking for information, let's say—and there's a pop-up right on the edge. But you can't quite read the information that you're looking for. So you exit out, and there's another pop-up. And it's designed, and that pop-up may be based on other information from you being on the web. So it's alluring.

I was looking for water faucets—not the kind you can get—a specific kind of water faucet for where I live, and you can't get it at Lowe's or—you have to do a deep search and endlessly there's pop-ups. Here's another set of water faucets for you, brought to you by Amazon or whatever. It just keeps happening. And I look at Aho, my wife, and she says, ""Forget that, we're not interested in that crap. You know, we're looking for—this isn't helpful,"" but in its own way it can be seducing.

When we practice with intention, deliberately, the path opens before us and it's wide and spacious. It's really simple because we understand that we can direct our lives now in a way that makes sense to us, that fits and has always been present as a trustworthy foundation. And your life changes when that happens. When you're on this path and you realize you can turn everything towards the path and you can trust that. And the results may or may not feel good in any given time, because we live in a relative world, and yet that too is trustworthy. And we could turn that to the path. And in doing so, we're moving towards a fundamental and vast responsibility, a responsibility for our lives. We can now own our life. And so all these other influencers and influences that are sneaking into our life are disempowered because we can recognize them as not helpful—or perhaps helpful.

And in walking on this path and in stepping into the responsibility for our life, it extends from my life to yours and your life to mine, because we deeply affect each other. And it's not just you or just me. We're entwined on this path. We are all walking the path together.

To study and practice the Buddha's way is to study and practice one's whole life. Within one's whole life is all of you. So although we're sitting here right now, at this moment, our whole life is contained in this moment. Our whole life has brought us here. And not only that, our whole life in the future is contained in this moment with all of the infinite possibilities.

Monday morning I went for a walk down Mill Road with a student and we walked together. I invited him to walk with me. And as we walked—I've been walking up and down that road for decades—and so many things have happened. I can recall a wild party that happened at that house, a Sangha party that I'm not going to share the details with. But some of you may recall a wild party or two from ancient days, or the people who've been there—some sick, some dying, some younger—or many other stories that we were sharing.

The Half-Secret garden, which if you go into, is an art garden and a place to sit. Suzanne—and I was wondering, is it still being taken care of? Yes, it is. And after I got back, I suddenly realized a remembrance from when I was the age of that student. And Roshi Kapleau, my first teacher in Rochester, New York, invited me to go for a walk. So I was the age of that student at that time.

Now then, and now—Richard Kapleau is an agent—at that time we went for a walk and he was very amused at me because I was young and vigorous and strong and worried about him as we kind of took a course through the streets of Rochester. Did he know where he was going? Or will he trip and fall? And it was a long walk, and he's seeing all this, can see it. And at one point he kind of says, ""Come on, we're going to go over here."" And we come to a strip, a median strip in a street between two sets of private homes. And he says, ""There, look,"" and there's a stone. And on the stone is engraved, ""Here lies Zen."" And he looks at me and he's quite amused, and he says, ""It's a dog. Someone buried their dog, and the dog was named Zen."" Oh, Roshi.

And here in this walk on Mill Road, forty years later, the same thing's happening—exactly the same thing in its own way. And that's the perspective that this practice brings us as we walk this road together. And on this road, we realize most personally that there are no barriers to one's life and no barriers to our realization. We walk the road. This is the great road of Buddha's ancestors. Many practitioners from many cultures and different times have pointed out the road and walked it so that we can walk it as well. They have done so for you and for me. It forms the circle of the Way and is never cut off. How could it be cut off?

Walking on this road, we begin to realize that our lives are thoroughly interwoven with this path. And nothing in our life—absolutely nothing—exists apart from it when we walk that road, when we make the road our life. The distinction between formal practice, practice here, and living our ordinary, everyday life entwine and become a continuous journey. And we're exploring that. We're exploring: is there a difference? Is there not a difference? Although we may feel this connection to this road more intimately in these particular circumstances and sometimes more than others, yet also, perhaps you've had the experience that not in the circumstances, but at home or work, we suddenly became completely intimate with the road, with what's going on and you, or with you and others, which really is the same thing.

Think about our mind of zazen. It's really the same as our life, seeing here the habitual patterns that we repeat regularly. And we can see how these patterns can be so tender and painful. And in seeing it, an option opens to respond in a new and fresh way. And we can study this and see this no matter where we are. It's easier, quote-unquote. Although, isn't it interesting how often we arrive here? And what do we run into? Ourselves. We throw up confusion, tiredness, sleepiness, too much energy, not enough energy, the food isn't right, my legs fall asleep. And yet everything is being offered to us. And everything is also being offered to us outside this room.

So as we study ourselves and our minds, be it here or elsewhere, and see opportunities before us to practice and to live in a new way, a different way, a fresh way, we know the old way and where that leads, and so do we wish to go in another direction. And this is the wonder and power of practice. Even if you say no and come up with a rationalization that no, I don't—knowing that there's suffering in your life or difficulty or barriers—even if we say no, if we continue to practice, there'll be more opportunities, more opportunities to kind of open the space. Even a little is a lot sometimes.

And so it's ours to choose which way to go. No one else but you can choose. That is the wonder and power of this practice—that you choose, which also can be scary. I mean, me, I want someone to rescue me. I want someone else—I'll call it the practice—to rescue me. But the practice is not going to rescue you. There's only one person who can rescue you from your suffering: Umuah, that's it. Usually, I say Umuah—as Miss Piggy would say. Do we know who Miss Piggy is?

So we can zone out to neutral thoughts, safe thoughts, or dullness that we're cultivating in the name of safety. And yet, on this road of ceaseless practice, there will come, as you continue to walk, points at which we're not so caught up in pursuing or avoiding pleasant thoughts or unpleasant ways of thinking. That point will come, does come, repeatedly. And so as we sit, we begin to see the possibilities through ongoing practice and explore the possibilities of letting go of our familiar harm that we're so habituated to. And this is the path of ceaseless practice. This is the point. It's not a matter that I was lost before, but now I'm on this wonderful road. It's all road. And we are increasingly willing to encourage our journey on this road as our own. We can see that it has always been there before us.

This is the mind of zazen. Dogen says it is that sustained effort that forms the circle of the Way and ensures it is never cut off. So Dogen speaks of this as a circle. It's a circle simply because it does not travel from point A to point B. We're here. We're always here. Where are we going? The circle is full. Nothing is outside it. Practice is the circle. You are the circle. We're not going anywhere in the sense of moving between these different places. We're in this vast circle of an unending practice, as our life, with nothing excluded, no event, no occurrence is apart from this. Your arms and heart are wide open, large enough to hold it all. You are large enough to hold it all. Mu is a circle. Breath is the circle. Shikantaza, just sitting, is a circle. Each step along the way is a circle.

From this perspective, you cannot get lost. No matter what happens, you can't get lost. Imagine living out of that confidence that no matter what happens, you can't get lost. You were trying so hard to be safe before, but you've actually always been safe without the trying so hard. Straight ahead, each breath, each thought, each no-thought, straight ahead, runs away as you step. Yet who is taking that step? Who is that one? Are you someone or something else while taking that step, while taking this breath? Are you adding a head on top of your head?

As we walk in the circle, we're always returning home, leaving home with each step and returning home with the same step. Between aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana, there is not a moment's gap. Continuous practice is the circle of the Way.

Right here in this statement of Dogen is the Buddha's original proclamation: I and all beings are once awake, have always been awake, whole and complete from the beginning. Though this is so, it has to be made our own. It has to be realized. And realization is not a thing. It's not, ""Oh, now I'm realized. End of story."" We're doing it now. On your cushion, on your seat, you're realizing the Way.

Ordinarily, we approach practice from some sense of lack, from our suffering and others' suffering, to a sense that perhaps we're missing a life as we live. So we take our practice, perhaps we encounter the aha moment and get turned on by this practice. ""This is the Way I've been looking for. Great, here it is."" Just go. So out of our aspiration to address what we are trying to address, we start, we practice. We cultivate the understanding and the clarity. We cultivate the insight into our being. And as we continue, our life reflects this practice as compassion, as wisdom, small bites. But as we go on, it grows, it gets larger.

So this narrative is okay as far as it goes. But as we deepen, we begin to see and realize that this is too small a frame to hold what our practice truly rests on. In a subtle way, it's too self-referential.

When Dogen says, ""Between aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana, there is not a moment's gap,"" what is he showing us? Not a moment's gap, no gaps. What is he pointing at? All the steps of our practice realization are present from the very beginning. They're all there. They've always been there. You don't have to go anyplace. It's always right here.

Early on, we may not see it this way yet. Aspiration and practice, enlightenment and nirvana are present from the very beginning. That's what the Buddha saw. That's what so many people have seen. And right now, now, as you practice, that is true for you as well, and me.

And that takes us to the question, because it has to be realized: Will you have the profound faith to practice wholeheartedly, to give it all that you can give it? Will you trust yourself enough to give it your all—not as some measurement of your effort that's important, but instead as just doing your very best without getting caught up in success or failure, just doing your very best to take up your practice, to investigate your practice, to go deeply within it? And when it is not wholehearted, to practice that. So isn't that wonderful? You practice wholeheartedly. And sometimes you realize, ""It's not quite my best."" You practice that. What does that mean, to practice that? Does it mean to rev up the motor? Does it mean to let go of the motor? What does it mean for each of us? It means a particular way of practicing that is yours, uniquely yours, that you have to see into.

So this is not an accomplishment, it's a cultivation of what is already there. So the practice is not lodged in our measurement of success and failure. It rests in the poco a poco study of our emotions and customary responses to our activities, to our relationships. And from this study we can come forth with an open heart under all sorts of different circumstances, some of which we never thought we could, and we can. And this is practice-realization. This is it. And it originates and rests in the cultivation of the vastness of silence in zazen. It rests in what you are doing here and continues in the moment-to-moment, non-stop flow of our breath and of our lives, of the moment-to-moment breath, just the breath and our whole life as a single thing.

So Dogen says, ""Continuous practice is the circle of the Way. This being so, continuous practice is undivided and not forced by you or others. This being so, continuous practice is unstained."" You can't fuck it up. You get it? If you give yourself to it as best you can, it's yours, it becomes yours, it becomes whole because it's always been whole. This being so, continuous practice is undivided and not forced by you or others.

What does undivided mean? Unstained, without division, without discriminations, not forced by you or others. It's whole.

Roshi Norman Fischer, highly regarded contemporary and teacher, makes a cogent comment about this, about continuous practice, and it really struck me, and it really pointed at the heart of this practice for us. He says, ""Continuous practice, though I am now talking about it and you are now listening to me and thinking about these things, cannot be identified with a concept of continuous practice. It would then become a standard, a measuring stick, which would inevitably become imposed upon you, and you would impose it upon yourself if someone else didn't impose it upon you. So it's not a thing."" His words are very wise words—to not mistake the words, the descriptions, the thought, for what it truly is. It's so much bigger than the words and so much more specific to you than the words and ideas of it.

We inevitably judge ourselves and measure our efforts and miss the very point we're examining. It reminds me that emptiness is empty of emptiness. There's no thing called emptiness. We talk about it all the time, but there's no thing called emptiness. There's no thing called continuous practice. There's no place where it sits. Conceptually, if we think about this, it's just an endless loop realized. It just is what it is. There's nothing to say about it. Although I'm talking about it and you're thinking about it. There we go, right?

The power of this continuous practice confirms you as well as others. That's Dogen. So how does this continuous practice confirm you? It's the practice of responsibility for our whole life. Our practice, our realization, arises out of, again, our whole life. And it extends from my life to yours and your life to mine. Present, right here, right now, you and I, continuous practice.

And so Dogen says, ""It means your practice affects,"" because it affects you and I together. Your practice affects the entire earth, the entire sky in the ten directions. Although not noticed by others or by you, this is just how it is. What you do in zazen—think about this—what you do in zazen affects the entire earth, the entire sky in the ten directions, every place. What you do arising from zazen within the moments of our ordinary life, affects the entire earth, the entire sky in the ten directions. You can see that as a heavy, heavy weight, or you can see it as one whole way to live.

We cannot measure the effects of our practice. The Buddha could not. He didn't envision us sitting here today. Yet we are here because of his practice, the ancient ancestors could not. And yet, here we are. And so it always comes down to it. What will you do with this? It's yours.

Thanks so much for listening.

37836,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-04-23 12:59","BA26","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Understanding Selfless Wisdom","","This is from the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.

Shāriputra spoke: The Perfection of Wisdom gives light. O Lord, she is worthy of homage. I pay homage to the Perfection of Wisdom. She is unstained. She removes the darkness from everyone in the triple world. She does her utmost to bring about the forsaking of the blinding darkness caused by the defilements and by false views. She makes us seek the safety of all the Dharmas which act as wings to enlightenment. She brings light so that all fear, terror and distress may be forsaken. She shows the path to beings so that they may acquire the five organs of vision. To beings who have strayed onto the wrong road, she brings about the knowledge of all modes through the avoidance of the two extremes, on account of the forsaking of all the defilements together with their residues.

The Perfection of Wisdom is the mother of the Bodhisattvas, the great beings. On account of her generation of the Buddhadharmas, she's neither produced nor stopped. On account of the emptiness of own marks, she liberates from birth and death because she is unmoved, neither unmoved nor destroyed. She protects the unprotected. On account of her being the donor of all Dharmas, she brings about the ten powers of a Buddha because she cannot be crushed. She sets in motion the wheel of dharma with its three revolutions and its twelve aspects, on account of its neither being turned forward nor backward. The Perfection of Wisdom shows forth the own being of all Dharmas on account of the emptiness of the nonexistence of own being.

This is one of the pieces of teachings that we've included in our liturgy that we do once a week instead of the Heart Sutra. And when we chant this, it really is the Heart Sutra. This is a slightly different version than what we have in the liturgy book, but this is drawn from the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, one of them.

The Perfection of Wisdom is a body of Buddhist teachings. Edward Conze, who translated this, said it's one of the most important, profound bodies of religious teachings in all humanity. He might be a little biased. It appears in the form of the Diamond Sutra—which is a little more extended—and then different versions, described by how many lines: 8,000, 10,000, 15,000, 25,000, 100,000. The sutras are very consistent, I would say unrelenting, in their emphatic teaching over and over and over again that all things lack any substantial, abiding, independent existence; that all things are empty of own being, existing from their own side independently. On every page, that's being expressed in different ways, of course.

In studying that, as I am now, again, the recurrence of that teaching over and over and over again in different ways has an effect. In a sense, we need to hear it again and again and again because it's startling, it's radical in its affront to our ordinary way of seeing things. At the same time, it is the most natural, simple human expression of existence.

And so, the Perfection of Wisdom is the wisdom of the paramitas, the principles and practice of the bodhisattvas—dāna, effort, vigor, patience, the precepts, meditation. It's the perfection of wisdom that allows each of those other practices to be embodiments of wisdom. When giving is endowed with wisdom, is illuminated, is enlightened by wisdom, then it becomes dāna pāramitā. When patience is realized as selflessness, then it is manifested as patience pāramitā, and so on.

The embodiment of the Perfection of Wisdom, prajñāpāramitā, as the mother of all Buddhas, goes back into antiquity. She sits on the right hand of the Buddha here. It's interesting that even in this passage, which is a very famous passage because it's such a beautiful, just expression of veneration for prajñāpāramitā, it runs the risk of doing exactly what the sutra is constantly saying not to do, which is to turn it into something—""she."" She is worthy of homage. She is the one who gives light. She is… So, it seems to very much be talking about something, someone who is prajñāpāramitā, who is endowed with all of these qualities, who will protect you, and so on.

And so, in studying this, in having this in our mind, we have to continually remember that this is just upāya. It's a way of speaking about something that has no form, is embodied nowhere. But it's hard to turn towards empty space, right? And so empty space is given a form as prajñāpāramitā, the mother of all Buddhas, so that then we can relate to this form—because that's what we do, because we have one, the world is filled with them. And so it's like there's a need to bring it into some form. And what form would help us the most as a way of inspiring and providing an example and giving us a sense of faith that the embodiment of prajñāpāramitā is something that we can strive for, we can have faith in our own capacity to realize that? Well, why don't we put it into a human form? I mean, you could put it into any form. In fact, it does take every form. But in terms of upāya, putting it into a human form brings it a little closer to home.

The mother of all Buddhas—the Tathāgata-garbha, the womb. Tathāgata is another name for the Buddha; garbha is ""womb,"" the womb of all Buddhas. From prajñāpāramitā, all life ushers forth: all practice, all teachings, all realization.

What is prajñāpāramitā? We chant it every day. Avalokiteśvara, doing deep prajñāpāramitā, deep within this perfect wisdom, clearly saw emptiness of all the five conditions—the skandhas. The Buddha said the skandhas are not only what constitutes the person, but what constitutes the world. The Buddha said, ""The skandhas are the world. The world is the skandhas."" And so they describe these different aspects: form, which you can take as your body; sensations, when your senses come into contact with something within their respective fields—sight, sound, taste, touch, feel, smell—there's a feeling, there's a sensation. Feeling here doesn't mean, you know, how I feel about something, but it means the sensation that arises in that moment of contact.

Perception: we perceive it. The mind instantly, immediately wants to know, ""What is this?""—to identify it, to name it, to place it.

Mental formations: our karma, the kleshas, our habits, our underlying tendencies usher forth in response to that perception, to try and not just put it into a place, but then to put it into a self. I'm not just interested in what this is, but I want to know, what is it in relationship to me? Because when the self arises, the self places itself at the center of the universe. And so it then needs to know what is everything that is the world that comes into the senses in relationship to this self, so that I can act on it, turn away, come towards, grab, project, love, hate.

And then consciousness: awareness of all of this—so ""clearly saw emptiness of all the five conditions, thus completely relieving misfortune and pain."" So the Buddha said that when we realize that each of those skandhas are empty of own being, that the form is not, that the self is not in this body, that when I have come into contact and I have a sensation, I don't exist somewhere within that sensation—it's just a sensation; that when I perceive that and name it, that the self is not in that perception, and so on. And when we really understand that, experience that—the emptiness of those skandhas, which are the self—what we're realizing is that the self is empty. Therefore, what is there to be caught in? And by what is there to get entangled by? What is there to be attached to? What is there to defend? What is there to build up?

Form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. Sensation, conception, discrimination, awareness—that's what that's saying. And prajñāpāramitā, the real nature of all things, is true in everything at all times. It's true before we encounter the Dharma. It's true in our first moments of zazen. It's true in every moment in which we're struggling. It's true in our realization. It's true at the moment of birth. It's true in our dying. It's true in our death. It's just the nature of things, the reality of things.

And yet, as we chant, when we do not see the way—when we do not see prajñāpāramitā, we don't see it, even as we walk on it, even as we're immersed within it.

In the same sutra, Shāriputra asked the Buddha, ""Well, how is the perfection of giving, for example, dāna pāramitā, fulfilled by a bodhisattva? What is the perfection of giving?"" And the Buddha said, ""The perfection of giving: when gifts, giver, and receiver are not taken as a basis, are not misunderstood to be something that exists with its own being, as something separate, distinct, apart."" The perfection of morality is realized through not transgressing into either offense or non-offense. In other words, we practice not offending, not transgressing against the precepts—we practice that. But ultimately, what the Buddha says is prajñāpāramitā is when we realize that, because nothing exists in and of itself, there is no absolute right and wrong that exists by itself, just in the universe floating around.

The perfection of patience: through imperturbability. (Imperturbability! Got it.) The perfection of patience, through being imperturbable. Think about when we first start practicing zazen—we're sort of in the opposite zone, right? The slightest thing knocks us off, knocks us off, knocks us off. Distracts, distracts, distracts, distracts. We get caught, we get caught, we get caught. And so, it's developing that profound stability that isn't a matter of holding on tightly, it's a matter of just not getting tossed. A hook is thrown and it doesn't land; there's no biting.

The perfection of vigor: through indefatigability of body and mind. When we practice and we struggle with energy, of course there can be different reasons for that. But ultimately, in the mind, in the body, there's the life force, which is the strongest force that exists within us. It's always there. And yet we can get very tired, weary, dull. We experience that—tend to experience that quite a bit in the early stages of practice, right? And it's easy to look at the schedule, or waking up early, or this or that as the cause. And the schedule is demanding. But what's really ultimately the source of that is our attachments, all of our, in a sense, misuse or not well-used functioning of our body and mind.

Prajñāpāramitā is not perceiving anything as existing on its own, as being separate, fundamentally as being opposed to something else in any absolute sense. It's the transcendence of all duality—realizing dualities are something that we create in the mind. They only exist, right? Something only exists in relationship to its opposite. Nāgārjuna said, ""This stick is long only in relationship to a shorter stick. If you introduce a longer stick, then this stick is shorter, but nothing has changed."" But if we don't understand that—and, of course, we can get that, that's why it's a simple example—but when we act as though that's not true and that things are endowed with an absolute sense of value, of quality, of characteristic, then that's what we grab onto, that's what we are rejecting or holding onto.

The perfection of wisdom gives light, Shāriputra says. And so this ancient—and I don't know if it's universally universal—but this employment of light and darkness: the sun, the bright light of day, and a moonless night. I have to think that there's something both primordial and very ancient about that. I mean, think about the time before electricity, right? When the sun went down, it just got dark, and everything was dark. So think about being in darkness—absolute darkness.

Years and years ago, when I was going to school in Kentucky, I went to Mammoth Cave, which is this huge underground network of caves, on a tour. We were walking and they had it lit, and it was with a group. At a certain point they had seats and we all sat down, and they talked about when spelunkers got lost in the cave, and that when they were rescued, what they usually talked about was most unsettling was not the absence of light, but the silence. That was what started to make them mad. And so the tour guide said, ""So let's try and experience that. We're going to turn off all the lights and then let's just spend a period of time in absolute..."" So you can really experience how absolute that silence is—just a little taste of what they were talking about.

So they turned out the lights, and it was black; you couldn't see anything. And I think the silence lasted for maybe five seconds. I swear, couldn't—couldn't happen, couldn't let that happen, even though everything was fine, nobody's in danger, we all know what we're doing, you've been asked. It's just too uncomfortable, too unsettling.

So, perfection of wisdom is giving light—it illuminates. And of course, remember what we're talking about here is Buddha wisdom, the wisdom that exists within each of us, our natural mind. That's what we're practicing to realize. Even though ultimately, by its nature, it's non-conceptual—that's why we can't think it into being. But when we think about any point of view, any mental state, any attachment, anything that obscures, confuses, increases our delusion, and so on, we're bringing forth, in a sense, a kind of darkness, a kind of veil.

On the other hand, when we're practicing—so every moment of letting go, of having the willingness to actually examine this mind, of developing understanding of the teachings, developing right view—even though all of that can be happening within subject and object, a self and an experience, in a sense, we're moving towards prajñāpāramitā. We're moving towards that bright light of wisdom in which things are not obscured.

And so in that way, any degree, in any way, that we diminish or relieve ourselves, or illuminate that which was hidden, that which was dark, and bring some degree of illumination to it, we're moving towards and living, experiencing ourselves more in accord with prajñā. So that's why it's so important in practice for the mind to be alert, awake, aware—because it's within those natural qualities of mind that we are more in alignment, more in accord with the very natural nature of prajñāpāramitā, which is awake. That's why that term is used so frequently: to be awakened, to be awake, to be wakeful—which is clearly not just not being asleep in the normal sense of the word, but it's to lift that veil.

Prajñāpāramitā is worthy of homage, to show respect for. And so what does that mean? When we're venerating or paying homage to prajñāpāramitā, what are we bowing to? Your mind, your wisdom, your Buddha nature. And so, in a sense, when we look at it the other way—when we're, you know, deluding ourselves, when we're not having faith in Buddha nature, when we're being self-critical, being judgmental of others—in that sense, we're not paying homage, right? We're in a sense not respecting that which deserves respect in ourselves and others.

I thought of the precept of perceiving clearly—not clouding the mind, the mind's natural radiance, the mind's natural clarity, which is what we're trying to bring forth so that we can realize prajñāpāramitā. And so, to give homage, to respect your bright, aware Buddha mind. In that way, we can think of zazen as a very profound and simple practice of self-respect—paying homage to yourself, to your mind, which we show the greatest respect to by letting go of our clinging, by freeing ourself of self-clinging.

Prajñāpāramitā is unstained. There's nothing apart from it. Nothing stands outside of it. It can't be corrupted or defiled. So, at our time, when it seems like every single thing is up for sale, everything has been reduced to a transaction—""If I'm going to give something, what do I get back?""—prajñāpāramitā does not even know that particular game. Unstained, not because it fulfills some idea of purity, but because there's nothing apart from it.

And so when we see stains, what appears stains within ourself—this thought, this emotion, this action, this quality—to bring to mind that your basic mind is unstained, right? As Suzuki Roshi said, ""You're perfect, complete."" That's prajñāpāramitā. And you could use just a little bit of work. Okay, a little bit of work. But to do that from within that understanding, that faith in being unstained—it removes the darkness from everyone in the triple world, brings forth that light, right?

Think about that ancient fear of night, of not having light. Those of us who live here—if you've ever been coming up and down the hill in the morning or at night, on one of those nights where it was pitch black, you couldn't see your hand, and then your flashlight goes out. I've had that happen. I had that happen once on the path coming over from the enbusu. And I was trying to feel the path with my feet, but I had shoes on, so I couldn't really feel it. So I got down on my hands and knees and walked like a dog, right? It worked, right? Because I could feel. So I could feel when I was on the path, and then I could feel when I started to wander. So imagine being—not on a path—in darkness.

So prajñāpāramitā removes the darkness and removes it in such a way that the batteries don't run out on that one. It rather illuminates what has appeared to be dark. It illuminates what appears to be dark.

It makes us seek the safety of all the dharmas. And there again, this language is so interesting, given the emphasis of the sutra that it is not something. Don't turn it into something. Don't take a stand on it. Don't solidify it—I mean, that's said over and over and over again here. It makes you seek the safety of all dharmas. So, how do we understand that it doesn't make you do something?

When we raise bodhicitta, when we begin to see more what's really going on, when we see how we are actively creating our unhappiness, our fear, our anguish, our anxiety, our tiredness—and when something just seems to appear without asking—how quickly we can begin to solidify that, turn that into something.

Think about during this week so far. You're sitting, everything's fine, and your meditation is whatever it is, and you just start to feel a little bit of a mood—a little bit of a mood, maybe a little tired, maybe a little cranky. You know, you just don't feel great. You're not in trouble, nothing's wrong, but you just feel a little... And then we feel that because it's in your body, right? And we can turn towards that. It's like, ""What is that? Oh, I don't feel, you know, don't feel so great. My meditation isn't going so good,"" and we can start to think about, you know, ""What's going on? What's wrong? Something's wrong. When I don't feel good, something is wrong, being wrong. Something needs to change. Something needs to be fixed here. What does it mean that I feel this way? Why do I feel this little tinge of mood coming on? What's happening? Is my zazen not good? Is this session not good? Is this dharma not good? Did I make a mistake? Do I not belong here?""

The mind can move so fast and create a world that, if we pay attention, we will see ourselves building it brick by brick by brick. But if we don't see it, then it just has power. Even if we do, it can still have some power. We can still feel it and feel in the grips of that.

So prajñāpāramitā makes us seek the safety of all dharmas when we realize, ""This has no meaning. I have a body. Something is happening. I don't understand. Maybe I don't need to understand. Maybe it's not about that. Maybe it's just a sensation. I'm calling it a mood because perception needs to name it. It's just a sensation. If I just let it be that and I don't add meaning, then it has no meaning. It's just a particular quality of sensation."" And that's such a really vital part of practice, is to develop that, strengthen that capacity. It changes things. It changes us. It changes our response. It doesn't change the thing itself. The thing itself is fine.

That's—as I was saying earlier, maybe that was yesterday—that's why sustained, extended periods of sitting are so important, so that we can just sit down and just—the world just comes and comes and goes and goes. And you're just seeing it, seeing the world turn as the world turns. For those of you old enough, there was a very famous soap opera years ago. They were onto something there.

It brings those who have strayed on the wrong road. It brings us back, or it calls to us. I think I spoke about this on the first evening—to one who is ready, to one for whom there is a certain degree of ripeness. Things have been stirring, things are moving, there's change, something is going on. We may not be aware of it. Oftentimes we're not—not really. And then we come into contact with something that is true: a teaching, the Dharma. We hear about meditation. We see someone, maybe a practitioner, and it gets our attention. It gets our attention. We notice it. Prajñāpāramitā brings those who have strayed onto the wrong road.

It is the mother of all Buddhas: the source of life, of strength, of ground and sky, freedom and discipline, of gentleness and fierceness, of an ancient knowing, of common sense, of selflessness, of compassion. In the sutra, there's a passage where it talks about how do we relate to the mother of all Buddhas? And they said, it's like if a mother had one child, three children, ten children, a thousand children, ten thousand children, a hundred thousand children, and all of those children loved their mother and felt so loving of their mother that they wanted to make sure that the mother was safe and strong and taken care of. We are the children. We have prajñāpāramitā. We are the child of the mother of all Buddhas. We are the mother of all Buddhas calling forth to the children.

I remember years ago when I was working on this, I had a memory of many, many, many, many years ago. There was a group of young people, teenagers, who came. They were living in a residence, and they were troubled youth. And they came to get some instruction—meditation, spend the morning here, and then we had lunch. And I was talking to this young fellow, and he was talking about, you know, his father had cast him out and he was living with his mother. And he said he was a hell being. He just caused trouble every day all over the place. And he said—and then his mother told him he had to leave. And he was incredulous. He was—even just telling me this, he was crying. And I said, ""But you said that you were causing so much trouble."" He goes, ""I know, but she's my mother."" And somehow he thought that he could do anything, right, that that bond was so unconditional. It's not. It's not. And nor is this one. Prajñāpāramitā will never have you leave home. She only knows how to call in. But we can be that unruly child. We can just be an inattentive child. We can not take care.

There's a story in the Therīgāthā of one of the nuns of the Buddha, Uppalavannā. She was born wealthy, went into the harem of King Kosala, who was patron of the Buddhas, and they had a daughter, Jīvanti. And they both loved this daughter so much that Kosala made Uppalavannā a queen. But then Jīvanti died young, and Uppalavannā was so overwhelmed with grief that every day she would go out to the cemetery and just grieve and grieve and grieve. And one day the Buddha came to her and said,

""Mother, you cry in the forest, 'Oh, Jīvanti, my daughter.' Come to your senses now. 84,000 daughters, all named Jīvanti, have been burned in this charnel ground. For which one of them do you grieve?""

And that can sound like a very stark, perhaps even uncaring thing. But think about that. Put yourself in the place of this grieving parent who can't leave, every day goes to the place where she has buried her daughter. And so this has been going—it isn't the first day, it's not the second day, it's been going on and on and on. And he says, ""Now, now you have grieved. Come to your senses. Not only your daughter is here, but 84,000 innumerable daughters, all of them loved, all of them lost.""

And she became a nun. And when she realized prajñāpāramitā, she wrote a verse. She said, ""Pulling out, completely out, the arrow that was so hard to see embedded in my heart, that I nourished every day, the Buddha expelled this from me, overcome with grief, the grief over my daughter. Today, with that arrow removed, I am free from hunger. I am unbound. Therefore, I go to the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, for refuge.""

I would take issue with her saying—respectfully, Uppalavannā, if you don't mind—with her saying, ""The Buddha expelled this grief from me."" I can well imagine that it felt like that. But only she could do that. Only she could do that. And maybe the Buddha came at just the right moment. He didn't come on the first day, he didn't come on the second day. She needed to grieve. She needed not only to grieve, but to get to that place, as she said, where she was nourishing that grief in her heart, tending to it, actively holding on to that. Because we can think to let go of that grief is to forsake that which we love, to somehow turn away from it, to forget. We should never confuse that.

Prajñāpāramitā protects the unprotected. When we fall into those two basic impulses—we want to avoid something, deny something, reject something that we don't like—it seems like that protects us, right? We're getting distance between, we're saying no to that. It seems like it protects us. When we hold on to something that we want, it seems like we're protecting that from being lost. But if we look—we don't even have to look that closely—we will see that that's not true. It is not. Protecting us actually makes us very vulnerable. It makes us vulnerable to that which we want to reject and to that which we would hold on to, which means it makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to actually experience the truth, the reality, the real form of that which we are rejecting and that which we want to hold on to.

Then Shāriputra says, ""How should one stand in relation to the perfection of wisdom? How do I do that?"" The Buddha said, ""Relate to the perfection of wisdom as to the teacher. So should one stand in the perfection of wisdom as you would to your teacher, as one should pay homage to the teacher. And here it's the Buddha, so also to the perfection of wisdom. And why? For just this perfection of wisdom is the Buddha, is the teacher. The teacher is not one thing and the perfection of wisdom another. Just the teacher is the perfection of wisdom. Just the perfection of wisdom is the teacher—one body.""

And so when we bow to the Buddha—the Buddha on the altar, when we bow to the Buddha sitting across from us in the zendo, when we bow to that true reality of all things that is sitting in our bowl which we're getting ready to eat, when we bow to our seat—all containers possess, manifest the perfection of wisdom, the true reality of all things. When we understand that, then it's perfectly natural to pay homage, to respect, to take care of.

And I'll end with this passage:

The Buddha's asked, ""How should we come to this perfection of wisdom? How do we realize it? How do we practice it? How do we realize it?"" And the Buddha said, ""To the extent that you do not approach anything, do not grasp at anything, do not try to hold on to anything, do not forsake anything, do not settle down in anything, to that extent you accomplish perfection of wisdom. To the extent that you do not procure, obtain any dharma, do not set it free or acquire it—because it is not something to set free or acquire—it is thus that one does not procure all dharmas, does not set them free, does not acquire them.""

And isn't that precisely what we practice, the path of non-attachment? Right? It's a simple phrase. It's a simple thing to say. It's a simple thing to seem to understand. ""Oh, again, don't attach."" True. But this is making clear—don't attach to what? To anything. To not attaching to prajñāpāramitā.

And it can seem overwhelming, it's like, ""Okay, I have to be on such guard duty 24 hours a day, never sleeping, right? So as soon as an attachment comes, I can shoot it down."" No, we don't have to do that. We just have to be alert and aware and awake and see, because attachments are not something that exist in space. It's, ""This moment I am clinging."" It's, ""This moment I am clinging."" It's, ""This moment I am clinging."" That's the moment when we practice non-attachment, when we're establishing something, making something, turning something that is like a whisper, a wisp, a cloud, a shadow, a mirage—all of these images that are used in the teachings: a magician's trick, a magical display, all of these ways of describing something that's ephemeral, passing, and isn't what it appears to be.

And so if we meet it in that very understanding—something is there, what it appears to be is what's having an effect on me, that's what I'm getting entangled in. But if I can be mindful and pause for a moment and just remind myself: it is not that. What is it? Let's see. Let me see. Let me allow it to reveal itself to me by not getting entangled.

And so in our practice, we are at once very grounded in just practicing: sitting, a breath, walking, a meal, laying down to sleep, having a cup of tea. And in every moment that we're practicing, we are immersed in this most profound—not just teaching, but wisdom—which is the nature of all things now.

So if we can really appreciate that, have faith in that, it can put a whole much larger, deeper, broader understanding of what we're in the midst of. Right? So it's not just—we're not just involved in a kind of mechanistic, you know, exercise. It's much more alive.

37835,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-04-20 12:59","BA25","","Zen Mountain Monastery","The Sacred Activity Of Work","","Lehman Pong taught: My daily activities are not unusual. I'm just naturally in harmony with them, grasping nothing, discarding nothing. In every place there's no hindrance, no conflict. Who assigns the ranks of vermilion and purple? The hills and mountains—last speck of dust is extinguished. My supernatural power and marvelous activity: drawing water and carrying firewood.

Good morning. I wanted to talk this morning a little bit about work practice, what we call work practice, Right Livelihood, and the Eightfold Path as part of our theme of the Eight Gates.

And by the way, I wanted to mention that when the Shuso, or the chief disciple, is not here, their seat should still remain.

Okay, so the sacred activity of work. What is work? It's a big, fat word. When I looked in the dictionary, some definitions: labor, toil, slog, drudgery, the sweat of one's brow, grind, sweat, donkey work, spade work, elbow grease—just gives you a little bit of a flavor.

So we can think of work as a necessary thing that we have to do. Meaning if we didn't have to do it, that would be so much better. In fact, maybe that's what there are people who strive to do, is to not have to work. Work hard, get wealthy, retire early, die.

We can think of work as a way to earn money to support ourselves. It certainly is that. And we can think of that just so we can buy stuff, enjoy life, retire, die. Work can be status, power, identity, society's rank—work. What work is valued, what work isn't, who's at the top, who's at the bottom? And so in that, when society, or when there is a conferring of status, it's hard not to be fooled by that. So that if you do something that is high value, then you must be of high value. If you're not, then you're not. And the way that goes in industrial countries is if you have to work by the sweat of your brow, that's at the bottom.

We did a—Daido Roshi led a retreat years ago on precepts for people who work. And it was like one of the questions was, in terms of what kind of work do you take a shower at the beginning of the day or at the end of the day? Do you drink Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts? Coffee, that is. And we grow up in that. We're taught that, and we tend to take it on.

It's been interesting, as the Sangha is developing, evolving, and getting older, that students speak about when they retire. You know, sincere practitioners really examining the nature of the self and identity and the ways we can accumulate and take on attachments. And I've talked to students who've really been surprised at recognizing how much they identified with their work when they weren't doing that anymore.

Before work, I was this person. I did this thing. I was seen in this way. This was not only how the world saw me, but evidently how I saw myself.

We can also think of work as service, as a giving, as dana, as practice, as study, as meditation. We can think of work as oryoki. What is the right amount? The right amount of work, of time, of money, of effort?

I remember years ago when I was at the temple talking to somebody who had been coming to the temple for a while. They were European. I don't remember what country they were from. And they were over here for a while working with an American company in New York City. And I said, is it different? He said, you people are crazy. He said, you work all the time. Don't you do anything else? He said, it's important, but it's not that important.

We can see work as relationships—to the work itself, to people, to what is it that's being created, what is its benefit? We can think of work as a spiritual power to study the self. Mindfulness training, going beyond.

Buddhism says that we move, as practitioners, we move within a Buddha field. And that field is—in the Vimalakirti Sutra, it speaks of that in various ways, but it's basically your field of influence. Then in many ways, our work can provide us with a field of a particular kind of influence. If you're a teacher in a classroom, if you're a person in an office, if you are a physician, if you are a nurse, if you are a construction worker, if you're a plumber, if you work in retail—we're coming into contact with people, hopefully. And in that, we have some field of influence, direct influence, both in terms of what we're doing in our work, what we're creating, what we're providing, but also in terms of our interactions with people.

In Jinzi Fukan by Dogen, spiritual power. Dogen says, the spiritual powers that are thus are the tea and meals of the Buddha family. No Buddhas up to the present have neglected or grown tired of them.

And Zen has a particular relationship in history with work. Because traditionally, in the early tradition of the monastic practice, time of the Buddha, monks weren't allowed to work. Monks and nuns, their work was being a monk and a nun doing Dharma practice. And so they begged for their food. Everything they needed had to be provided by the lay Sangha.

So from the very beginning, there was this very important and essential relationship between the monastic and the lay communities. And they were reciprocal, so that the monastic community was provided with support and food and clothing and so on. And they in turn provided teachings to the lay community.

In the Zen tradition, the monasteries—so in order to do that, you have to live in places where people live, right? If you're going to go begging for your food, you have to be where they are. Zen monasteries in China began to develop, establish themselves in remote areas. Look at Eiheiji, that Dogen developed in Japan. I mean, at that time it was way out. So they had to rely—they still relied on donations, but they also tended to be more self-supporting.

Every living thing works. We can think of it that way. If we think of work as activity in which something is happening—every living thing gives and receives, gives from itself and receives. It's receiving, right, in order to have life, and then it gives some of that. The sun, you would think, is working. It's providing us with light and warmth. Every living thing is supported by the environment in which it lives and then offers support in turn. And in the non-human world, that usually works in a very nice way.

When I was studying mathematics, I thought one of the nice things about mathematics is you never have to write papers, you know, if you don't want to write papers. And in one of my courses I had to write a paper. And so I wrote about a particular form of mathematics that helped to explain and sort of demonstrate mathematically the relationship between predator and prey and how different conditions, different environmental conditions would affect that. And this was all presented mathematically. I have forgotten all of that. I couldn't, wouldn't understand it if I saw it now.

I mean, look at spring, for goodness sake. It's happening everywhere. Every living thing goes its own way of being in the world. Think of a tree, right, that from the very beginning, all the way through its life and all the way through its death, it is giving, it is providing, it never ceases to give. And in that sense it works. But it doesn't know work, it doesn't think of work, it's not going to work, it just is. That's its way of being in the world.

In the human world, it's a little different. We can think of it as karma. We act and we create consequences. We can think of work that way. I do something, and it has some effect.

Kanzeon, at one with the Buddha. At one with the Buddha in cause and effect, Morning mind is Kanzeon. Evening mind is Kanzeon, the great Bodhisattva of compassion related to Buddha in cause and effect. We should examine that. What does that line say? How is the Bodhisattva of compassion related to the Buddha? Wisdom and cause and effect. Compassion at one with wisdom in cause and effect. Morning mind is compassion, wisdom, one thing. Evening mind is wisdom, compassion, one thing.

The Buddha taught right livelihood, right? That there are some livelihoods the Buddha said, that are just not, not right. Why? Because they create or they encourage not living rightly: weapons, selling intoxicants. And so he was pointing at, you know, that what we do has consequence, so we should reflect on that.

And work is grounding, right? We're doing something. We are somewhere. We're located somewhere. We're touching things, and it's grounding, right? During sesshin, it's really important when we spend so much of the day sitting in silence, so much of the day turning inward, that there's this period of time in the morning where we both take care of everything that we need to take care of so that we can actually do sesshin all together. And also so that we can ground ourselves if we need to encourage that.

It brings us into direct contact—body, mind, breath, energy, things, as well as beliefs, history, associations. And in that way, work is a bed of deep habits, deep habits that started early, possibly even before we worked. We were children. We were seeing our parents go to work. We were seeing other adults go to work. We were listening to them talk about work. How did they think about it? What did they say about it? How did they like it? Was that a positive experience? Was it positive teaching?

I remember when I first started working, I was—I mean, I, you know, I mowed lawns, I babysat. I had a paper route when I was really young. But when I was, I don't know, twelve maybe, I went out and got a paycheck job, you know, working in the back of a laundromat, washing dishes in a restaurant. And I remember my mom saying, ""Oh, honey, you don't have to—don't—you don't need to work yet. You're going to work, spend your whole life working. You don't need to do that yet. You know, just be a kid."" She would say, just go out to do kid things. But I wanted to work. First, I needed—I wanted to have a little bit of spending money. And I couldn't really ask for that from my parents. And so I wanted to, but then I realized I kind of liked work, that it was a good experience, and it was completely on my own. They didn't help me. They didn't interview, you know, they didn't—I'm pretty sure they knew where I was working, but they weren't, like, watching it real close. I was really—so I was at a very young age. It was like, you know, I'm doing this, I'm the one who has to be responsible, which is incredible. It's really invaluable for me.

The Buddha said, around work, he said, follow the teachings on wholesome and unwholesome actions in your work. Let those be your guide. The precepts—how are they being manifested or not in your work? And of course, many people work in situations in which that can get complicated, right? There can be a lot of good, and there could be stuff that's not so good on any different kind of level. And a lot of students, really, honestly, in a very valid way, work with that, struggle with that, try and find their way into that, through that.

He also said that as we're earning income, accruing some wealth, that we should do that properly. We should support ourselves, our family, we should give some to the community, give some to the Sangha, he said, and also put a little away.

It's very interesting, the Buddha who had these teachings on work for the lay Sangha, but he said, don't use wealth as an end in and of itself. That's not right livelihood, just earning to earn, making money to have money. Use it, direct yourself, direct it.

And so we can think in that way of work as being grounded in trying to create no harm. And oftentimes that's not possible. So can I do something that creates the least amount of harm? Are there ways to mitigate that harm? Are there ways to sort of offset, pay back for that harm that I might be creating?

The Buddha said—he said we should gradually increase wealth without squeezing others, just as bees collect honey without harming the flowers. It's a very nice metaphor, right?

We can think of work as a way of keeping our house in order, which is actually part of Buddhist practice. Keep your house in order. Because the Buddha said poverty is a cause of pain. He said, when we're poor, one runs into debt. And this situation can very easily lead us into a state of decline in various ways: mentally, physically, spiritually, right? Then when we're anxious, it's very difficult to practice on an ongoing basis and settle and develop our mindfulness and deepen our concentration if what we're anxious about is that our house is not being well taken care of.

And I think I was thinking this morning, one of the interesting things about work is that in a way, perhaps all work brings in some level of tension, of anxiety or even fear. And I was thinking this is—probably goes all the way back to the beginning of time. And not just for human beings. I mean, in what other ways other creatures do or don't experience fear. But, you know, lives depend on it, right? So even as human beings, if you're going out hunting, are you going to eat, right? If you're gathering, are there things to gather and eat? In other words, it's not a trivial thing. And so within that, there can be anxiety, tension. And for us, there is. Our lives are supported by this. So it matters, right? So what we do is, you know, can have a lot of these different qualities of spiritual practice and thinking about what we're creating. But also, on a very basic level, it's like we're supporting ourselves. We're providing for our necessary needs. And so there can be an anxiety, because if that is dependent upon that work and in that dependency, right, there can be tension.

In the early years when I first came here, I grew up in a house in which, for various reasons, we didn't have a lot of money and we had a lot of debt. And so I grew up in that kind of environment. And in other ways, it was a wonderful, loving house and family. But there was that. And so when I first came into residency or soon thereafter, I was—I was put in charge of bookkeeping. And I was like, I don't know anything about bookkeeping. I've hardly ever had any money, right? And they're like, but you studied mathematics. I said, it doesn't—it's not the same. And it wasn't. So I had to learn. But that wasn't the hard part. The hard part was feeling responsible for the financial body of this place at a time when there was never enough. And it was like, just order me to go to hell, please. That would be better. So I had to deal with this ongoing tension, this ongoing anxiety that wasn't just about taking care of my house. That was hard.

It's interesting, in physics, work has a very particular meaning. Work equals force times direction. So if you have a box—I was listening to some guy, he said, if you have a box and you're pushing it, so there's a certain amount of force going into pushing that box, and it moves in the line of you're pushing, and the work is that force times direction. But what if you're pushing from an angle? The box is here, and I want it to go that way, but I'm pushing down here. Then the direction is diminished, right? The force is—I mean, the force is diminished because it's not all going in the line of direction.

And so if we think of that in terms of practice, in terms of mind, you know, we talk a lot about intention and raising aspiration, but that intention is a kind of force. But then what direction are we applying it in? And are we applying it wholly in that direction? When we try and help a student clarify, when they want to become a student, why do you want to do this? It's to try and see, or somebody wants to do jukai. You know, is it really—is the intention really what jukai is, or is it for other reasons? Yes, I really want to take these vows, I want to be a bodhisattva, and I also want to raise my status a little bit, right? I want to maybe seem a little bit more important, you know, so that's a—that's not a direct application of intention, right? It's not all moving in the same direction, which means the force, the work is going to be diminished. It's just a different way of looking at it.

So spiritual power equals effort times intention. The mind merging with the body equals the cause versus aspiration. We take up work as a way to study. That's why it's so important that we do the caretaking practice, right? So that we don't just assign jobs and go to work, but we stop and we do this liturgy. That's very clear. We chant the sutra of compassion. We don't chant, you know, the sutra of drudgery and toil, right? To bring our attention, to make it very clear, what am I doing? I am being assigned a task. Thank you very much for giving me that opportunity to serve, to give. But what is underlying that? Is it just to make lunch? Is it just to tend the garden? Is it just to clean a bathroom? Make it larger.

Dogen says, make it the 3,000 acts of the morning and the 800 acts of the evening. Don't exclude anything.

And so in thinking about work, let's think of it as all activity, right? Not just if you're paid for it or if you're unpaid, if it's physical or mental. If you're retired, we're still doing something. You still wake up each day. What do you do? And so if we think of work as whenever, wherever I come into contact with myself, with activity, with things, with others, to think of that as a sacred activity, a sacred work, right? So we can kind of reclaim it from just being what happens nine to five or whatever hours you clock in and clock out.

When I was younger and worked on a couple different farms, Egg Lane Farm in Georgia and a dairy farm up near Utica, you know, I learned so much working on these farms with these farmers where work and life was completely integrated. They didn't wake up and say, I'm going to work. They just woke up and their day was before them, and there was much to do. But always, particularly in this farm I worked on upstate, always, people would come by, neighbors. And Freeman, the man I was working with primarily, who ran the farm, he would stop and he'd go over and they'd sit on the fence for a while and they'd talk and have a very leisurely conversation. Often he would be telling them about my latest mistake, what I had last done that was like, you know—which when it happened, he got furious about, but then became food for entertainment and good stories. It helped sort of me lick my wounds and think, I'm actually providing you with a lot of good stuff here.

But watching just their relationship with work, and they never called it that. There wasn't that kind of consciousness. The way they worked with their animals, the way they worked with machinery and powerful—I mean, I was young, I was pretty fit, and I had to hustle to keep up with them.

Wendell Berry says, when the scale is right and the work answers the calling of the workers, what is needed, then such work as they would rather be doing anything else in the world, then the work comes to be motivated by love, and that changes everything. Love always changes things.

He says, when work is done for love—of the place where it is done, of the materials, the artistry and the product of the work, of the people it is done with and for—then the sign or evidence of it will be beauty. It's beautiful. Both the work and its result will be beautiful. Ugliness in work or in its results is a sign of something gone badly wrong. Something's not right here.

In my early years, when farming here was smaller—he's talking about rural Kentucky in scale and far more discipline of the eyes and hands than it is now—an adjective often applied to work was ""pretty."" A farmer would mow a field, cultivate a row, crop, and then look, stand back, and say, ""Oh, that's pretty work."" That word can give pleasure—is one of the happiest things we can know of our life in the world.

I would say, amen to that. When I think about the things that I learned, particularly younger, so important because I was young, you know, I was learning. I didn't have all this experience. I was learning from the people around me who were always adults, older than me, and people from all different walks of life. In the back of a laundromat, in the back of a kitchen, I was working with people who oftentimes lived hard lives. And they taught me lots of things just through conversation. I was a kid—paying attention, taking responsibility, being accountable, showing up, being patient, persevering.

When I worked in that restaurant, I'd come in after school and there would always be a huge pot from the morning breakfast of grits. Now, if you've ever made grits and then just let them sit afterwards in the pot, you know what I'm talking about. It takes the consistency of concrete. And I never—I didn't know enough, so I never just put it on to soak, right, which would have made it very light work. I didn't know how to do that right, so I would scrape and scrape and scrape. That was my—that was my beginning work each day. So perseverance, openness, honesty, being honest in our work.

That job on the farm, he asked me if I knew how to drive a tractor. And I came to that farm on my bicycle. I didn't even have a license, and I had long hair, and I was from the South. So he was looking at me like, I don't know. He said, ""You know how to drive a tractor?"" And I thought, that's probably important. So I said, ""Yes, I do."" And I thought, how hard could it be? The first day, he tells me, he doesn't just tell me, go get the tractor. He says, ""Get the tractor, back up, hook it up to the manure spreader, and then bring it around."" So I jump on the tractor, and he's there with a neighbor, and they're just talking, and they're just watching me. And I'm watching them watch me. And I'm like, okay, this is the moment. Figure it out. Figure it out. I can't figure it out. And he comes over, he says, ""I thought you knew how to drive a tractor."" I'm nineteen maybe. And I said, ""Yeah, that was a long time ago. I forgot a few things."" He just shook his head. Yeah, he enjoyed that.

Daido Roshi talks about, you know, in very practical ways. And that's part of the power of work. It's practical, right? He said there's preparation, and this is the whole—a whole body and mind thing. Work is a whole body and mind thing. It's not just, you know, being mindful. That's not enough. There's much more going on. So he says we should prepare. And then there's doing the work itself, and then there's completing the work, cleaning up and leaving no traces.

I was thinking of this building. I think of it often because it's such a marvelous building in and of itself and a testimony to the love of work. The people who built this building could not but have loved what they were doing. You see it, it's all over. And Siobhan, who's been helping us create this narrative of early Sangha members who helped to make this place happen, he's also done some research on the building. I just want to read a little bit.

The Arts and Crafts style of architecture that this building was designed in has its roots in Europe, 19th century. And it says in this idiom, the Arts and Crafts inspired building was a simple, functional and beautiful structure with all parts carefully integrated so that it would be a factor in the growth and happiness of the people who lived in it. So it was built very consciously in such a way that it would help encourage, strengthen the growth and happiness of the people who lived in it. In plan, the spaces flowed easily into one another in order to maximize socialization and to ease the burdens of maintenance. Well, I don't know about that. The Arts and Crafts aesthetic required the use of natural materials—wood, stucco, stone, plaster—with the quality of craftsmanship of great importance. How is it done? In addition to the importance of materials and craftsmanship, the building should be sited in a location that harmonized with its landscape.

We struck gold, all of those things coming together years ago when we needed to. Originally, for many years, this floor had a subfloor of pine, which was a subfloor, but they never finished it. They never put on a finished floor. And it had lots of peaks and valleys, significant peaks and valleys. And so it was time to put a floor on. And I was—and I didn't know about this kind of thing, so I was getting quotes from these different contractors. And I would listen to them, how they—their plan for leveling the floor in a way that would, you know, have some stability for years. And there were some of them that I just thought, that's just not going to work.

And there was one guy who came in and he talked and he, you know, talked. He wanted to go downstairs and look downstairs. None of the other people wanted to do that. And then we were back up here and we were at that back entrance and I'm talking to him about the project and the plan and I realized he's not listening to me. And what he's doing is he's looking at that pillar right as you walk in that's got these cross hatchings, and he's just looking at it and he's just touching it. And I said, you're the one. I did. I mean, both because his plan I thought seemed brilliant, but also I thought because you already love this place, you already recognize the love that was put into this and you want to add something to that.

Daido Roshi says our ordinary tasks can be wonderful opportunities to practice. When students reach a certain maturity in their zazen, their work, their life, all they do helps them develop an equivalent clarity and integrity. Work emerges as an active function of zazen.

Dogen said about Lehman Pang's poem that when he said ""spiritual power and wondrous function, carrying water, carrying firewood,"" he said, you should thoroughly investigate this teaching. Carrying water means conveying water. There is your own work, your own intention, and there is others' work, teaching others, and they bring about conveying water. What we do is our own work. What we do becomes others' work.

One way of looking at what we're in the midst of right now and all throughout all samsaric generations is when other people's work is not done out of love, then their efforts and the consequences of their efforts becomes everybody else's work. And oftentimes burden, oftentimes what is given is ugliness. Because people are not loving their work. There is no sense of artistry, of care, craftsmanship, of the importance of doing something and doing it well. Not in an uptight way, not in a perfectionistic way, but just for the love of it. Because it feels good. It feels good in the body and mind.

When I was working in a restaurant years ago, when I was in college, I was being asked to do way more than was reasonable, but that was the job. So I took it on. And I realized every movement I made has to count. In other words, I can't do any superfluous movements because there's too much. And what I realized was over time, as I was just trying to actually survive and get what needed to be done done, that it was kind of moving, flowing. I discovered it was kind of became a kind of elegance in the work and my movements. It wasn't what I was shooting for in the beginning, but it was like it was kind of coming out of that. And I remember beginning to recognize and thinking, oh, we can think of work in our liturgy, in service positions that many of you do in oryoki, and in those forms of practice, I think we do see and can experience a sense of dignity. It is dignified and again, not in a, you know, I don't know, stupid kind of way, contrived kind of way, but just a natural dignity of being that arises from doing something in such a way that is whole, that is complete, and that the thing itself is good, that's important, that the thing itself is good, because we can give ourselves wholly and completely to something that isn't good.

One way of thinking about it is that it's really cultivating in a sense—I think what we might strive for, aspire to, is that in our work we begin to really understand and experience what Buddhism teaches as ordinary mind, everyday mind, which in a way is the coming together, the culmination of everything that we're trying to do in practice. It is the essence of prajna paramita.

I remember when I worked on the koan, Nanquan and Joshu, and every ordinary mind is the way. And I worked on that koan and I worked on it, worked on, and eventually Daido Roshi passed me through it. And I realized, I haven't really seen this. I've had some insight, but I haven't really seen this. I had a sense that I was engaging something that was very deep, very big. And I imagined that I would spend the rest of my life really plumbing the depths of that. And I think I was right in that reckoning because it's still ongoing.

Dogen says, ordinary mind means to maintain ordinary mind in this world, in any world. Yesterday goes forth from this moment and today comes forth from this place. While going, the boundless sky goes. And while coming, the entire earth comes. This is everyday mind. I think of this as the perfection of work. If work was another paramita—work paramita—coming together, bringing together all the other paramitas, bringing together all of the precepts, all of what we do in practice. That's why it's really, honestly, one of, if not the most challenging aspects of practice to fully integrate, to fully harmonize, to fully embody, right? That's why it's so important that we practice it every day. Not just because every day we need to take care of things, but how do we take care of them?

Dogen says, ordinary mind opens the gate of the inner chamber because thousands of gates and myriads of doors open and close all at once. This is ordinary mind. This boundless sky and entire earth are like unrecognized words, a voice from the deep. The practice is doing that. It's opening that door, the boundless sky, entire earth, unrecognized worth.

When some of you have come here and have talked about, you came here maybe the first time and felt in some way that might have been hard to understand or explain, but the words that you used to explain that was that you had come home. I know that feeling. It's like encountering something and speaking unrecognized words. A voice from the deep that isn't in this place, but somehow the space is evoking that, bringing that forward.

Words are all-inclusive. Mind is all-inclusive. Things are all-inclusive. Sacred activity, when it's all-inclusive, is sacred. And what is sacred is beautiful. And what is beautiful serves, gives.

Is that why flowers are so beautiful? Is that why we're so moved by the creatures of the earth, by a spring breeze, by an open sky? Is that why they're so beautiful to us, so that we are moved by them? Are they providing us examples of that artistry, that depth, that inner chamber? I think so. And all of that without intention, right? It's not that it was all put there for us, but can we receive it as though it's being given to us?

And I really appreciate Daido Roshi for caring so much about that and really wanting to instill that, teach that, and make that an important part of what we did and our own tradition, which values that, recognizes that, has liturgy around that. The regard for a grain of rice, for how a meal is prepared, for how things are done, right? Because things that are done are just not things done. But it's my mind and body made manifestations. It's my love, it's my caring about myself, about this, about you.

Good morning.

This is from Master Hongzhi, who was a 12th-century Chinese master:

> Fully appreciate the emptiness of all dharmas,  
> Then all minds are free and all dusts evaporate in the original brilliance shining everywhere, transforming according to circumstances.  
> Meet all beings as your ancestors; subtly illuminate all conditions, magnanimous beyond all duality, clear and desireless.  
> The wind in the pines and the moon in the water are content in their elements without minds interacting.  
> Wind and pines or moon and water do not impede one another.  
> Essentially you exist inside emptiness and have the capacity to respond outwardly without being annoyed.  
> Like spring blossoming, like a mirror reflecting forms amid all the noise, spontaneously emerge transcendent.

He says, fully appreciate all dharmas, the emptiness of all dharmas. Then all minds are free and all dusts evaporate in the original brilliance. Fully appreciate all dharmas, then all minds are free. Whose minds is he talking about? Your mind and my mind? The mind of all dharmas. What does that mean? He says, then all minds are free and all dusts evaporate.

These dusts are the six dusts—the objects of our senses—which are called dusts sometimes in Buddhism because, in our attachment to them, to the objects of our senses, we get clouded, confused. Our mind, our original mind, is clouded, covered over. When they evaporate, he says, there is the original brilliance shining everywhere.

So what are these dusts, actually? How is it that they evaporate? Fully appreciate the emptiness of all dharmas.

Maezumi Roshi was Daido Roshi’s teacher, so one of our great grandfathers in the Dharma, would say, “Let us appreciate.” It was kind of one of his refrains, this very simple line: Let us appreciate. I find I return to that, to his teaching, this simple teaching. What is he pointing to? Let us appreciate. Just remembering.

There are a couple of early, in my practice, a couple of interactions that I remember. One, I was in a group of students meeting with a famous teacher and some of us had the opportunity to ask a question. One of my friends asked, “When I see something beautiful, how can I see it? How can I see it more fully? How can I appreciate it?” And another interaction was with Myotai Sensei, who was one of my early teachers here in daisan. I don't remember what the daisan was about, but I remember at some point she said, “For instance, if you would like to appreciate the gray of your robe…”

And these questions, I was kind of like, what are you talking about? My friend who asked the question about seeing beauty, I was like, what does that have to do with resolving my suffering? I don't understand. How is that a Dharma question? I think I couldn't see—how I couldn't see that my vision was clouded, my experience, I’d numbed. And yet I heard these questions. They stayed with me. They have stayed with me.

I think that at that time, I somehow also knew in me that I was divided, I was clouded, distracted, not able to see the world around me, and that that was part of my suffering. I knew I was suffering. This is part of the trap of samsara. It seems that a little bit of distance, a little bit of distraction, a little bit of numbing is protecting, protects. Maybe we do get a little bit of pleasure, comfort, but really we're distancing ourselves from ourselves, from our life, and that is suffering.

Let us appreciate. Maezumi Roshi says, how do we come closer? Coming closer, we can appreciate. Coming closer, there is a radiance. Coming closer, we come closer to ourselves.

Hongzhi again:  
> Fully appreciate the emptiness of all Dharmas. Then all minds are free and all dusts evaporate in the original brilliance shining everywhere, transforming according to circumstances. Meet all beings as your ancestors; subtly illuminate all conditions, magnanimous beyond all duality, clear and desireless. The wind in the pines and the moon in the water are content in their elements without minds interacting. Wind and pines or moon and water do not impede one another. Essentially, you exist inside emptiness and have the capacity to respond outwardly without being annoyed. Like spring blossoming, like a mirror reflecting forms amid all the noise, spontaneously emerge transcendent.

I chose this passage, these practice instructions from Hongzhi, because I wanted to speak about reverence and devotion. Last week, when I found out that I would be giving the talk, I was just kind of feeling around in myself—what would I like to explore, to offer, to talk about? And that's what I found. If I'm passing, paying attention, if I'm just practicing, well, this is always a live place. This is—maybe this is where practice is happening.

And when I read that passage, it was also, oh, and it is spring and we are celebrating Buddha's birthday. I also had the question, is this kind of speaking to the moment? I sometimes feel a question: is there an avoiding? I hear that from others in practice, and turning inwards? I don't think so. I think maybe that's not quite the question. This is exactly what we need more than ever. And we need other things.

In this ango, we're studying the eight gates of training, Daido Roshi’s offering practice. We can understand the eight gates—each of the eight gates, take them as practices of coming closer, different ways to come closer. Each gate is a practice of cultivating reverence, devotion, learning to appreciate, learning to appreciate more fully.

Hongzhi is giving us practice, instruction, guidance. The practice is to appreciate all dharmas, he says, to fully appreciate as they are. What has to happen for us to come closer? What's happening when we come closer? There is letting go. We have to let go of something, move through something, loosen what it is that divides, holds us separate. What is that? What needs loosening?

Hongzhi says, wind and pines, or moon and water do not impede one another. How would they impede one another? How do we impede one another in our relationship? They are in relationship, but so close.

When I read Hongzhi's practice instructions—there's a whole series of them, several dozen—always they include turning inwards. There he's speaking about zazen: to turn in deeply, cultivating stillness, cultivating the empty field. He says to be intimate, and always in each of them, I think there's also at least a line about turning out. Turn inwards and then turn out, in intimacy and not knowing. Is there also kind of turning in and turning out at the same time? When we really come close, is turning in—what is turning out? When we meet, truly meet a dharma, a thing, we meet ourselves.

Of the eight gates, zazen, in a sense, is the most direct. I think it's helpful to remember that it is one of the eight gates. It is a gate of practice, certainly a practice of coming close. Can we think of zazen as a devotional practice? Cultivating reverence in zazen?

In thinking about zazen and some of the other gates of practice, it's always felt to me like what we learn in zazen—the coming close, the learning that we can be quiet, the learning that we can concentrate our mind, we can be present with one thing, present with ourselves—that that informs the other gates of practice. But we also learn in other areas of practice. I think for some of us, there are kind of natural places of entry: art practice, body practice, work practice. We also learn to give ourselves over. We learn to enter caretaking practice, work practice, this practice of coming close in work, in our human activity of work.

Recently, Shugen was introducing caretaking at the beginning of retreat, and she said very simply, you know, each of us will be given something to take care of. What happens when we're given something to take care of? What happens when we take care of something? It changes our relationship with it. There are so many things that need taken care of—to take care, there is a letting go, there's a giving of ourselves.

I feel like we don't say this so much anymore, but there used to be—we used to talk more about leaving no traces. Maybe there are still signs in the bathroom that say, “Leave no traces.” I just don't see them anymore. Kind of an emphasis on leaving something finished, so that you're leaving it, letting it go, and leaving it complete, in a sense. Why? What does it do? Does it create when you do that?

I was thinking about the ushers straightening the zendo. So there are a couple of people, a couple of residents who are assigned as ushers, and they both hand out the books. But then when we all leave the zendo, their instruction, their service is to straighten the zendo. And, you know, when we leave the zendo, usually we're all pretty good about straightening our own seat, putting the cushion back in the middle. You could turn around and look at the zendo and say, yeah, it's good, it's straight. But the usher's instructions are to come back and to straighten each cushion, to smooth each zabuton, plump up each zafu, put it back in the middle of the zabuton. When I learned to be usher, I was told if there was an obvious seam on the zabuton, to put the seam towards the back. If there was a label or a name tag, to put the label towards the back. If the zabutons have a label or a stain, to turn it over.

And the ushers straighten all the seats in the zendo, and then they go and check the Buddha Hall, straighten the Buddha Hall. Sometimes they know the Buddha Hall hasn't been used since the last time they were in there. Why? What happens? Do we take care of things for others, for the next person to come along and see, appreciate, feel that? You do feel something when the zendo is well taken care of, or anything is well taken care of. Do we do it for ourselves, that the ushers have this practice opportunity, an opportunity to come close, to study a dharma, to study these dharmas, appreciate them? Do we take care for the things that we're taking care of so that they can flourish in their own way?

What happens in caretaking when we hold ourselves back? Some of the things that I, just walking around, will notice, I will see something and I'll say, “Oh, that's someone else's job. Someone else will take care of that.” Or “I don't have time.” I come in kind of in a hurry. Or “I'll get it next time I walk by, pick it up.” What happens when we don't walk by? We pick up a piece of trash and carry it to the trash can next time we get to a trash can, straighten the umbrella that someone left to dry.

Hongzhi's friend Dahui would say, all of these are first-class times to make efforts to arouse and alert yourself and awaken—awaken opportunities to come out of ourselves, to come close.

Liturgy is the gate of practice which maybe is most obvious that we are cultivating reverence, devotion—a place where we actually talk about that. When I introduce this much of introduction in liturgy and beginning instruction, people who are new here, I talk about reverence. When we bow, we're expressing reverence, cultivating that virtue. But how is it that liturgy is a practice of coming closer, of appreciating always, kind of in every practice? That is the practice, right?

So when we're chanting, it is a meditation practice to just chant, to be wholehearted, to be complete. That is the instruction for officiants: simply don't be doing anything else. The first time I heard that, Shugen was talking to a group of us, and I may have been the only senior there, so the only person who was actually officiating. And I remember he was talking about liturgy and he said this, and then he just kind of paused and looked at me. Then he went back to talking.

What are we cultivating reverence for in liturgy? When we're bowing to the altar. You could say we put a Buddha on the altar so that we can bow to the Buddha, bow to awakened nature. And for me, in liturgy, it's always, whether I'm doing it by myself or doing it in sangha, it's always, sort of in a simple way, just remembering that I'm not alone. Liturgy, we can offer the world to the world. We can affirm the wholeness of things.

I wanted to say a little bit about Buddha's birthday. You know, when we come to Buddha's birthday, I will always—this is, I think, the only sort of holiday that we celebrate, sort of Buddhist holiday that we celebrate. You know, everything else, we just do zazen or we do sesshin, right? That's like how we celebrate, which is great, right? And I don't know, this one feels different.

So just a little bit. I just looked some stuff up. There are some stories about the Buddha's birth, and so one of them is that when he was born, he was born sort of as a child, fully grown, and that he took seven steps on lotus blossoms that appeared for him to step on, and he pointed to heaven and earth. So that the baby Buddha that we bathe, that's why he is in that pose. Those figures were made by Kaijin, who was a monastic here for many years. For some years, I don't know how long, it was sort of in her—monks don't really retire—but sort of in her retirement, there was less and less that she could do that felt productive, and that was a struggle for her. And for a while, what she found is that she really enjoyed making these ceramic figures. And I think she made a lot of Jizos, and there are a few of them around here and there, you see them still. She died quite a while ago now.

So the Buddha is said in some stories to have pointed to heaven and earth, pointed up and down, and said, “Between heaven and earth, I alone am the honored one.” Another story says that when the Buddha was born, there were fountains of water that rained down from the heavens. One was warm and one was cool, to bathe the baby Buddha and his mother who had just given birth to him, Queen Maya.

I looked at just what a couple of contemporary Asian teachers say about this ceremony. One said that bathing the Buddha is an opportunity, that we're purifying our own body, speech, and thought. This teacher says in doing that, we might experience reverence or joy. Another teacher said the ritual of bathing the Buddha has a humanistic meaning. It not only expresses the reverence of Buddhists for the Buddha on the occasion of his birthday, but also gives everyone a chance to introspect themselves so that they may reduce bad seeds, increase good seeds, open their minds, raise the seeds of enlightenment, make life more meaningful, and bring happiness to all sentient beings in this universe.

So maybe that's what we were doing this morning.

In art practice—the gate of art practice—which for me has not been a natural place of entry. But I feel like what I have learned in art practice is kind of exactly this: appreciating that it's when I take time to do art practice and just sit with one thing, as we're doing this ango for our assignment—sit in the woods somewhere or walk in the woods and just listen and just look, kind of allow myself to be open and wondering—that when I can allow that, then something sometimes happens, if I stay long enough.

This ango I'm writing. So it's like, sometimes, like, well, if I just keep writing long enough and listening and looking and holding myself open, then sometimes something opens. Sometimes something comes out in my writing. Sometimes the expression helps, it seems, helps me to come closer. Sometimes something comes out and sometimes not much.

I saw this in one of Hojin Sensei’s retreat descriptions recently. She said, “Our path into expression, which will be informed by the silence and stillness of zazen, to help loosen the woven web of knowing that constricts our heart and mind and that often pressures us to yield to a certain result.”

All of these practices, we could say, are ways to loosen our woven web of knowing—this woven web which constricts our heart and mind and pressures us to yield to a certain result. How do we loosen this woven web of knowing?

Master Dogen said, “When you reflect on your life activities, are they intimate with zazen or remote from it?” When you reflect on your life activities, are they intimate? How do you know if they are intimate or not? This isn't a question that's like a value judgment—it could be hard for a lot of us to avoid that—but it is a place of study: is this skillful? Am I coming closer? Is this intimate or not? Or is it unskillful? Am I moving further away? Am I holding myself apart?

The skillful or unskillful, I think, can be a really helpful kind of guiding question. Awareness. If it is coming closer, how is that? If it is not closer, how is that? Can we feel that? When it is dividing and distancing, how does that feel—body and mind—to pay attention to that? Can we tell the difference? Because then we can choose. Then we can move closer, move into—into our lives.

Hongzhi says,

> Essentially, you exist inside emptiness and have the capacity to respond outwardly without being annoyed. Like spring blossoming, like a mirror reflecting forms, amid all the noise, spontaneously emerge transcendent.

We do have the capacity to respond without being annoyed, without resistance, without any discord. And we get annoyed. I appreciated what Daio said yesterday: just like, sometimes it's just grumpy. I felt like this line kind of brings us back. This is not just pretty poetry, right? Yeah, we get annoyed. For me, I feel like these days, a lot of the time it's just a little bit. It's just a little bit of tightening, a little bit like I do have an opinion, I do feel a little resistance. But we do have the capacity to respond without being annoyed.

And he says that we can do this amid all the noise. Amidst all the noise—there is a lot of noise, but what is the noise? I think it's kind of the same question as at the beginning: what are these dusts?

And emerging transcendent—again, not to be kind of intimidated by the language. That is no other place than—no other person than—yourself.

I read this recently from Shishin Roshi, who was one of Daido Roshi’s Dharma brothers. He says,

> Because we have not developed confidence and trust in ourselves, we continue to look for a flash of insight or sign outside of ourselves. Rather than shedding the skin of our old habit-ridden selves and entering the unknown. In this unknown realm, we cannot rely on any of our old tricks for maintaining separation, which is the actual cause of our confusion.

I just thought it was helpful in the way he says that it's because we've not developed confidence and trust. We are developing, can be, should be—in coming closer, developing confidence and trust in ourselves. Seeing it is not outside, is not anywhere else. We don't need to look, wait for something from the outside. Come close, look here, enter here, learn to trust.

So I'll end with Hongzhi one more time:

> Fully appreciate the emptiness of all dharmas, then all minds are free and all dusts evaporate in the original brilliance shining everywhere, transforming according to circumstances. Meet all beings as your ancestors; subtly illuminate all conditions, magnanimous beyond all duality, clear and desireless. The wind in the pines and the moon in the water are content in their elements without minds interacting. Wind and pines or moon and water do not impede one another.  
> Essentially, you exist inside emptiness and have the capacity to respond outwardly without being annoyed. Like spring blossoming, like a mirror reflecting forms amid all the noise, spontaneously emerge transcendent.

This is from the Entangling Vines Koan Collection.

Once, at the time of the Buddha, seven wise women were taking a walk through a charnel ground. The eldest pointed to a corpse and asked the others, ""The corpse is here, but where is the person going?"" One of the younger women replied, ""What's this? What's this?"" The other women all saw clearly and attained enlightenment.

This is a collection that comes from the Linji School. Not much is known about its compilation, but a lot of the koans come from the other classical collections: Miscellaneous Koans, Blue Cliff Record, and Book of Serenity. And there's just the case here; there’s no verse, no commentary, no pointer. Just: ""The corpse is here. Where's the person going?""

We end each evening remembering that life and death are of supreme importance. When a student enters the zendo for the first time as a student, they say, ""I come here realizing the question of life and death is a vital matter."" Why does Buddhism so emphasize this?

One of the things I appreciated when I first encountered the Dharma was how it spoke of, and seemed to turn towards, things that we would rather not turn towards—how it acknowledged what we'd rather deny. There was something very refreshing, very affirming in that: fearless to face what we would like to avoid. If you're lost in the woods, the first thing that we need to do is acknowledge, ""I'm lost."" If we're sick with an illness, we need to acknowledge, ""I'm sick,"" so we can take the next step.

Where's the person gone? Spring brings life to the mountain. Summer is rich and verdant. Fall gives us a dazzling display. Winter is cold and quiet. These cycles—earth cycles, cycles of creatures, cycles of life—birth and death, coming and going. It's an ancient cycle. It's eternal, it's universal, it's inescapable.

Why do we fear this? The Buddha wanted to know why. These essential realities are true for every living thing. But as human beings, why do we fear this? And fearing, what do we then put our trust in? What do we turn towards? What do we rely upon?

Well, there are different ways that Buddhism speaks of that, but if we think of it in terms of desires, there's the desire for just sensory experience, sensory pleasures. Right? The thing about pleasure is, it's pleasurable. Things that feel good, feel good, right? It seems built in, right? It seems to have a purpose. Things that are not good don't feel good. And so there's a sort of evolutionary, biological intelligence to that—you know, don't go towards the things that are not good for you; go towards the things that are. But then, we get that all mixed up. So much so that when we enter the training, in Buddhist practice, the teachings are there to actually help us understand what actually is good. What actually should I be moving towards? What is skillful? Something we don't always know.

And then there are the desires for existence—just to be. And, the Buddha teaches, there's the desire for non-existence. And I've seen that present in different ways, whether it's the desire for non-existence in this moment—because existing, being, this mind, these patterns, these attachments, I would just like to be done with them—or, at its sort of extreme, could be the desire to cease to live altogether.

A baby is born; a human being is brought into this world, human consciousness. That is a toddler, adolescent, youth, young adult, middle-aged, old person. And there's a sense that there's somebody in that person that is that person, that maintains themselves, that person all the way through. You know, when you think about yourself as a child, you might think, ""Who was that stranger? They had my name. But why’d they have my name? They weren't me."" We don't think like that. We think, ""That was me when I was young, this is me now. When I'm older, I'll be me—older."" But what about when I die? What happens to me then? Where does ""me"" go?

There was a practice in old times, in the Buddha's time, of practicing within a charnel ground, where people who had died would just be laid out. There are, in fact, very detailed—more detailed than you might want—meditations to meditate on a corpse as it is actually decomposing. And the Buddha is very explicit with this: different stages that the corpse goes through as it basically is disassembling. The teaching or the practice of that was both to recognize—because he said we kind of get fooled by the packaging, right? Which is kind of nice. It is nice, right? But we think that's all it is. And so it's sort of like, okay, well, take off the package, and what is it? Well, it's, you know, kind of gooey and smelly and all kinds of stuff—and to sort of disenchant us, our attachments, not just with the body, but with the body as ""me,"" and my clinging to the body as me.

Because, you know what? It's going to get older, and that body's going to change, it's going to get sick, it's going to change even more, it's going to die. Now it really changes. And so that attachment to the body itself is primordial, ancient as we can imagine. And so these practices were to sort of address that directly. Those didn't travel so well when Buddhism left India. Asian practitioners didn't seem as enamored of that practice as in the Buddha's time.

Non-attachment to the self—this sense of self. So there's someone, if you think of it, that is listening right now to this talk, right? There's a sense that there's someone in your body who is listening, hearing, reflecting, reacting. There is someone who is sitting on your cushion. There's someone who will afterwards chant and bow, and then that someone will go downstairs and have lunch, and so on—all through our lives. And the Buddha said, yeah, it does seem like that. It sure does. It seems like that to everybody. And so we take it as a kind of inarguable, you know, something that doesn't even need to be argued—it just seems self-evident to the self.

You know, if you look up ""self"" in the dictionary, in a Western dictionary, it's got a very, very long passage section. There are many things that are associated with the self—many things where the self is the prefix of something more. It's at the center of things, and it's understandable, it is our actual experience. I'm looking out at you. Well, you're not me. I'm looking out at you. And there's a distinct experience that someone's doing that—I'm doing that—and that you're looking back at me. So there must be something going on on both ends.

And what the Buddha realized is that that sense of self is just that—it's just a sense of something. You're sitting and you become aware of yourself sitting. That's a sense of something arising. It's like a sensation, it's a perception. And the Buddha said that's all it is—it's a perception. It is something our mind does, it's something we experience in the mind, and we impute into that a sense of a reality, a permanence, an essence, something that exists in and of itself. It keeps showing up—how could it not? And the Buddha said, as soon as that arises, then you have everything. Everything that we see now in the human world, you have, because there's a boundary.

And that sort of essential priority of that self is not just to live and survive, but to be—to be and to establish itself in beingness. And then, having the self, being this person in this boundary, what do I do with all of you? What do I do about that? Particularly if you infringe. Particularly if you do something or say something that seems to threaten me. Right? You offer some helpful criticism, right? Something is hurt, right?

Evelyn Underhill, in the book that we recently studied on mysticism, she says, ""What is it about human nature that when we experience something that is hurtful, that event comes and goes, it's gone in an instant, but the self continues to be hurt? Something is hurt and continues to be hurt long after the cause of that injury is gone."" That's the self—a sense of self.

So the Buddha realized that it's empty—it doesn't exist like that. It exists in the way we experience it, as a perception that comes and goes, but it doesn't exist as anything more than that. And so that's why Buddhism, there's a lot of teachings and practices of turning towards, facing, remembering—remembering what we want to forget. Time swiftly passes by, opportunity is lost.

I remember being a child, a young person, and waking up every morning to hear my father, who was a heavy smoker, hacking, hacking, coughing, coughing, coughing—all of it out. And at one point, I remember I was a teenager. I was laying in bed listening to that morning ritual and thinking, ""He thinks he's going to live forever."" I hadn't encountered Buddhism before, but it just seemed like—I mean, I didn't understand addiction, I didn't understand how addictive cigarettes were. I just thought, he's making a choice. And why would he choose that unless he thought he was going to live forever?

And so there are meditations of visualizing yourself, your person, on your deathbed, dying, to just hold that in your mind. What happens now in your dying process—just to visualize that you're not there to fix anything. It's just a mental image. But we create mental images all the time that seem very real to us. We react to them, we talk to them, we act out of them. So now you're employing that—but deliberately, mindfully, and for a good purpose—to face that inevitability that we would rather not, and to try and make it real in our mind, and then to take it a step further and visualize yourself as that corpse, lifeless.

And if you've ever been with someone who is in the dying process, very close to death, unconscious, not responding, not reacting, not giving any of the signs of life other than breathing, which is becoming increasingly erratic, and then that moment when life seems to have departed, and the dramatic shift of that—even when the person is unconscious and is completely still, unmoving, unresponsive—the very palpable change when it seems as though something has left—what is that? So Buddhism understands that it's consciousness. And it's not you, it's consciousness. It is the continuity that has been going on forever and, in different lives, has been assuming different forms and continues because it has no end. But it's not the self, it's not the person.

So here, when the elder says, ""The corpse is here, but where has the person gone? Where is that person? Where is that self?"" And another nun says, ""What's this? What's this?"" And they're all enlightened. So the student of that koan has to enter into that. ""What's this?"" It's not intellectual, it's not conceptual, it's not an idea. ""What's this?""

The Buddha said, we impute a sense of self into this body. ""This is who I am. I am. I exist. I am this. This is mine."" And then I extend that to my possessions, my relationships, whatever I want to belong to me. To ask, ""Where has the person gone?"" can already imply that there's a person. They've gone somewhere. Let's go find them, right? Are they a ghost? Are they in heaven? Or are they in Buddha heaven? Are they in Buddha hell? Buddhism has hells. They're like pretty juicy hells, really. Buddhism lacks no imagination. In the hell realm, there are multiple hells, all kinds, for all kinds of lives. You don't want to go there. Even the best one, you don't want to go there. I'm telling you.

There was a poem that Maezumi Roshi liked very much. I think it was sort of taken as his death poem. Something—I'm paraphrasing, I couldn't find it, I don't remember it completely—but something like, ""After I die, you can call, but I won't answer. I won't have gone anywhere."" And yet we do take care of this body, this Buddha body, because it's your vehicle, it's your vessel. Take care of it, right? It's the body you practice in, you meditate in, you love in, you work in, you do good for the world in. But what about those attachments we have to it— that attachment to self? And of course, our culture, society, you know, companies, businesses want us to be attached to the body. It's good for sales, right? So we glorify youth. We disparage aging.

But you know, the funny thing about aging—I heard somebody say, ""Nobody wants to get older, but it's the club you actually want to be a member of,"" right? Nobody wants to be excluded from that club. But where's the person? Where did the person go?

So some people resolve that, or try and resolve it, by wanting to live forever, right? That's probably been going on for as long as—maybe forever. Wanting to live beyond. It's okay, I'm going to die, but I can keep living, right? Somewhere, somehow. Or just not wanting to let go of this life.

A very important experience I had when I was a teenager was I had an uncle who was, you know, had some good qualities, in many ways was not a very nice person. He lived kind of harshly. And he was dying. He was dying of cancer and he was dying. Everybody knew it. He was in the hospital. He was in his deathbed. He was not having it. ""Don't talk to me about death. I'm not dying."" He was not having it, and he would not die all the way to his death. And that was a very powerful experience for me. It's like, oh, that's a way to go. And the aftermath of that was because he didn't accept his dying, he did not do certain things to take care of people who had given him a better life, like his wife. He would not do certain things, so she suffered quite unnecessarily after he died because of his clinging. Self-clinging. That's the nature of karma. Where is the person?

Dogen says the great way of all Buddhas, thoroughly practiced, is emancipation and realization—liberation through realization. Then he says, ""Emancipation means that in life you are emancipated from life, and in death, you are emancipated from death."" Well, everybody lives and everybody dies. So what is he talking about? He says there is detachment from life and death and entering into life and death. This is the complete practice of the Way. There is letting go of life and death and vitalizing life and death. This is the thorough practice of the Way.

And so we can speak of emancipation as to be free of all of the various forms of our greed and our anger, our pride and jealousy—all the things that bind us, the kleshas that we act out of and cause all kinds of trouble, our false views, our confusion, our indifference.

Indifference is non-attachment—not attaching. It's not grasping, it's being free of anxiety, free of trying to control. It's not clinging to inner experience, it's not clinging to outer experience. It's not clinging to this self, it's not clinging to others' selves. Detachment doesn't mean distant, it doesn't mean cold. It's immediate. It's right here. It's just not clinging.

And he said, and so there is vitalization—that when we let go, there's vitalization. Attachment has a dampening quality. It dampens, right, because our attachments are constricting. It's like trying to stuff something alive into a box, to domesticate it, control it, to know it, to have it, right? And so it loses its vitality. It becomes dim, it becomes distant. It's our holding on that causes things. When we let go, there is no box. It becomes vibrant. It doesn't become vibrant—we just experience it in its vibrancy.

And so he said, from within life and death, we are liberated from life and death. It's the only way. We think we'll be liberated from death by never dying. I mean, think about it. If you had the choice to live forever, would you take it? Think about that. Would life be sweeter, more precious? Would you use it better? If you knew that there were an endless, infinite number of tomorrows, what the hell does today matter, right? You've got forever tomorrows.

This is a complete practice, Dogen says, which means it requires a complete person. I mean, think about when we're fearful in our lives, when we have anxiety. And I think, I will propose, that if we really pay attention carefully, we'll see that there is a very subtle, sometimes not so subtle, deep underlying anxiety of existence, because we know it doesn't last forever. We already know that, and we respond to that in a whole host of ways, many of them not so helpful.

So think: if we acknowledge the fear of death, of life, then it's hard to enjoy life, right? Because we're fearful. It's hard to experience it because it seems to get in the way. It's hard to be free because we're not. And then, of course, it's going to be hard to face death. How can we face death if we haven't really engaged and understood life? And then what if we're afraid of death? It's going to be hard to live, right? It's going to be hard to grow old. It's going to be hard to experience illness. It's going to be hard to be with others as they are getting sick and growing old and dying. It's going to be difficult to be joyful in life because there's this specter that has not been examined, not been attended to, that basically is not understood. That's what the Buddha said. We fear it because we don't understand it.

I mean, one way of thinking about death is, you know, it's a pretty august group that has preceded you. Right? Some notables there. Not the first time.

There's another koan from this collection in which a poet went to see Master Huang. And Huaitang said, you know, the passage in which Confucius says, ""My friends, do you think I'm just hiding things from you? In fact, I'm hiding nothing from you."" And then the Zen master said, ""It's just like this in the great matter of Zen. Do you understand?"" And the poet said, ""I don't. I don't understand what you're talking about."" 

So later, they were out walking in the mountains where the air was filled with the scent of locust blossoms. And Huaitang said, ""Do you smell the fragrance of those blossoms?"" And the poet says, ""Yes, I do."" And Huaitang said, ""You see, I'm hiding nothing from you."" Later, the poet came to visit again. And Huaitang said, ""I'll die and you'll die, and we'll end up burnt into two heaps of ashes. At that time, where will we meet? Where will we meet?"" And the poet didn't understand. And it is said that later on he was on a trek and he woke up from a nap, and as he woke up, he saw it, he realized it. Where will we meet again?

We so easily fall in. You know, Buddhism acknowledges—the Buddha recognized—the deepest, most persistent belief that we have is in me and you, in the self. He said, you know, all of the different things that we disentangle ourselves from and free ourselves from and realize as empty, and even realizing that the self is empty, directly experiencing that and experiencing that again and again, it will continue to arise.

I remember reading an old but contemporary master who said, ""I have seen that the self is empty, but every time I stub my toe, ow, I hurt.""

How could Huaitang hide the scent of the blossoms? They're there for everyone. Everything is like this. When the mind becomes more clear and settled, the world appears more vital, more alive, more immediate, unhidden, undulled. Here, here, here.

Dogen says, ""Realization is life. Life is realization. At the time of realization, there is nothing but life, totally actualized, made actual. Nothing but death, totally actualized.""

I remember when my dad was coming close to the end of his life. He had cancer and it was not a good prognosis. He knew he was going to die of it. And we met one time and he was very anxious, very frightened. He was afraid of how he was going to die. He was afraid of being in a lot of pain, and he was feeling very vulnerable. He said, ""I don't know how to do this."" He said, ""I've never done this before."" I said, ""I know. And I think if you can be here now with this, and then you keep doing that—just be here, right?"" Because he had been an alcoholic for much of his life, so his habit was to not be here. It was to dull himself, to turn away, to deny that. And so I said, ""If you can just be here and then keep doing that, I think at the time of your death, you'll know what to do."" I wasn't going to give him instruction in zazen. I didn't want to offer him a teaching of the Buddha. The Buddhist teachings have complete integrity. And you don't need to use any language, of course, to be here.

Because we have such a habitual impulse to not be here, we have to train ourselves. That's why we've been talking about mind training during the weekend. I can recognize I need to be here. I'm keep going away, I'm turning away, I'm fearful. I don't want to experience this. I need to be able to be more mindful. But I don't—I can't—because I haven't developed that. I can have moments, but they're fleeting, and then the fear takes over. So I need to develop the capacity to actually do that. That's what training and practice are.

Dogen says such activity makes life holy life. It's a complete practice. Dogen says for a complete person, it makes life holy life. Nothing is missing, nothing has been dimmed, it's not dull. And it makes death, holy death.

You know, practitioners, students that I've talked to who are approaching their death and sometimes are experiencing pain or medication, and they want to be alive into their dying. I've had students who said, ""I don't want to miss this, I don't want to dull this. I want to be present. I want to be able to experience, to practice into this.""

""I'm hiding nothing from you,"" Huaitang said. To be a complete person, to practice with your complete mind, to not divide, to not separate, to not be. The Buddha said, ""When you're sitting, don't think, I am sitting, I am meditating, I am concentrating, I am letting go,"" right? Because that's just re-establishing, reaffirming, strengthening the sense that there is a self and that there needs to be.

Because we could think, well, how the hell is all this happening if there's not a self? How could I have done all of this in my life without a self? You just did all of that without a self. We are doing this right now. Without a self. The self is the illusion of something that isn't what we think it is. It isn't as it appears.

And so the teachings say, yes, there is something that appears—it seems like a sense of self. So let’s just agree on that. Now, what is the nature of its existence? How does it exist? Because without investigation, it seems to exist in the way we think: it's solid, it's fixed, it's permanent, it's got a soul, it's me. So then it makes sense for me to attach to it because it's me. But the Buddha said because of that, we have dukkha, we have samsara, we have human beings—intelligent human beings who have Buddha nature, who have fundamentally enlightened mind—acting like monsters, creating evil, actual evil in the world, cruelty, hatred, and not accidentally: consciously, strategically. That's the pain of the Bodhisattva, is to actually see that more and more clearly—the foolishness of how we can be. And yet we have this incredible intelligence, this fundamentally compassionate heart, this capacity to free ourselves, to be a Buddha.

Huineng said that there's fundamentally no difference between being an ordinary being—an unenlightened, deluded being—and being an enlightened being. When an ordinary being believes in a sense of self and attaches and strengthens all of those binding emotions and views that cause a lot of trouble for self and other, they start out as a Buddha—they're an enlightened being—but they look out and they see the world is just filled with ordinary human beings, right? Expendable. A lot of them are just in the way. When an ordinary being sees—frees themselves of that grasping, of those false views, of those attachments—then they look out and they just see a world of Buddhas, and too many acting unknowingly.

And so Avalokiteshvara hears the cries of the world, hears the suffering. She's that courageous. But you know, it's not even courage for her. She just hears. She doesn't wake up and think, ""Okay, I'm going to be courageous today."" She just wakes up and hears and sees and she responds. But as we, on the path of enlightening ourselves, have the heart of Kannon Bodhisattva but are not quite fully actualized, sometimes we have to wake up and say, ""Okay, be brave, have courage, have faith. Don't give up. Everything is possible. Nothing is set, nothing is fixed, nothing is permanent."" Even in the worst actors, they're suffering. They may know it, they may not. They may care, they may not. They're causing harm. Yes. That needs to change. Yes. What can I do? Yes.

And so we have to vitalize ourselves again and again and again. We have to start over again and again and again, right?

There's a—you know, the dualistic mind is like, you know, sort of—when I was a kid, teenager, I had friends. There was a big lake in Georgia we used to go to. I had a friend whose family had a boat. So, you know, sometimes we would ski, you know, sometimes we'd tie an inner tube. But why do all of that when you could just hold onto the rope and have the boat drag you through the water? Particularly after you've had a couple beers, right? So we would do that. So it would just drag us through the water, right? You know, and you're just drinking all this water. But then at a certain point—so it's hard, right, because you're being dragged through the water, and the boat's speeding up and they're all laughing—but at a certain point, you start planing and you're just skimming across the water, right, like a dolphin.

Why did I think of that? There was a connection that I have lost. Maybe it has something to do with starting out, you know, slog—having to slog our way through for a while until it gets easier. But, you know, samsara kind of stays the same, but it doesn't. You know, it's kind of like the path itself.

I remember sitting in this zendo more than once in a misery—in a misery at the bottom of a well. Dark, alone, waiting to be saved. Nobody was coming to save me. And thinking, oh, this is so hard. I don't know if I can do this. I don't know if I can do this. And then I would reflect—it happened a couple times—where I would start thinking about, you know, like, what if I just give it up? You know, go back, go back—to what exactly? Was that easier? And every time I thought that, I thought, no, that was hard. That was hard because there was no path. I was just at the bottom of a well. And that was just it—having a path. It's not the same misery. It kind of feels the same, but it's not.

And so to think of ourselves, our own practice that way, to think of the world that way. You know, Buddhism—one of the interesting things is for all of its fearless facing of life and death and suffering, of all the things we'd like to avoid, in a way is extremely—I don't know if optimistic is the right word, but really sees human beings as fundamentally on a path towards enlightenment. Every human being. Why? Because we have a fundamental aversion for what is destructive of life. And we have a basic affinity for what is life-affirming. And so through successive lifetimes, there's a sense that we are inexorably moving towards the ultimate affirmation of life, which is enlightenment—the total actualization of life and death, the complete embodiment of a liberated being—and that everyone comes along, no one is left out. I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.

And it takes time. Because it takes time. It takes time within this lifetime. And so that's something that practitioners have to essentially grapple with, right? Because we're not used to that. Like, we'll engage something that's difficult, but there's a very specific goal there. You're basically promised. It's not like that. What you're promised is you have Buddha nature, you have the capacity to do this. And the rest, in a very real sense, is up to you. But, you know, take some traveling partners with you—it makes for a very different journey.

And so Buddhism is so perfectly turning towards life, which is now—I said on Friday night, it's the only show in town, right? And it also has this long view, right? Because if we just reduce everything to this moment, then everything rides on this moment. You can't fail, you can't misstep, you can't do anything. But if there is an ongoing succession of moments, then when you fall, it's okay. Here's another moment. Stand. When you get lost, it's okay. Next moment, find your way back. When you give up on yourself, next moment, find your faith.

Dogen said, it's like riding in a boat. You raise the sails and you steer. Although you maneuver the sail and the pole, the boat gives you the ride. So take care of that boat. But it's just a boat. And without the boat, you can't ride. But you ride in the boat, and your riding makes the boat what it is. The boat isn't a thing that you got; it's something we create every day. It's like the boat of this monastery, right? This is a monastery. But where is monastery? Is it in this hall? Is it in the dining room? We create this every day. We're creating it in this moment. It's the boat, and your riding makes it what it is.

So he says, investigate such a moment. Examine that—the implications of that. What is actually going on? What is this boat? What is this ride? How am I steering it? At just such a moment, there is nothing but the world of the boat. The sky, the water, the shore, are all the boat's world. Your world, our world, which is not the same as a world that is not the boat's. There is no other world. Thus, you make life what it is, and you make birth your birth. You make life your life.

And that isn't just a matter of, you know, thinking positively. It isn't that with your mind, you're literally creating everything, and if you stop thinking, everything is going to disappear into a void. It's not that. It's that the world is what we experience it to be. And if our experiencing of a moment, of every moment, is cloudy, is bound, is fearful, is angry, that's the ride we're getting.

But to shift the direction of that boat has to be honest. It has to be genuine. You can't just say, ""Okay, I'm going to be happy and not sad. I'm not going to be angry anymore."" Try that, right? You will not succeed. And not because you're not trying, not because you're not a good person—because it's not sufficient.

We make life what it is. We make birth what it is. And isn’t that what’s so painful—is when we see people who are in a position to create such a good ride for themselves and others, run it into the shoals. It hurts. It should hurt, right? But to carry that hurt, to bind ourselves to that, becomes paralyzing.

And so, as practitioners, as you lose your skin, as you increase the capacity to feel, to experience, to engage in dukkha and suffering, as we are bringing forth compassion, loving-kindness, sympathetic joy, equanimity, we have to let go. We have to let go, right? Otherwise, we'll just go numb again. And so that really works together, right? So in a sense, as we move more into our lives, the stuff of practice becomes more important. Whether we're doing it through the Buddha way or another way, to not cling is an essential path. Buddhism doesn't own that. It's not proprietary. It belongs to everyone. So shall we take advantage of that and spread a little around when you get the opportunity?

This is from the Book of Serenity, Dijiang: Planting the Fields.

The pointer: Scholars plow with the pen, orators plow with the tongue. We patch-robe mendicants lazily watch a white ox on open ground, not paying attention to the rootless auspicious grass. How to pass the days?

The main case: Dijiang asked Zhishan, ""Where do you come from?"" Zhishan said, ""From the South."" Dijiang said, ""How is Buddhism in the South these days?"" Zhishan said, ""There's extensive discussion."" Dijiang said, ""How can that compare to me here, planting the fields and making rice to eat?"" Zhishan said, ""What can you do about the world?"" Dijiang said, ""What do you call the world?""

Hongzheng's poem: Source and explanation variously are all made up. Passing to ear from mouth, it comes apart. Planting fields, making rice—ordinary household matters—only those who have investigated to the full would know. Having investigated to the full, you clearly know there's nothing to seek. Zhifeng, after all, didn't care to be enfeoffed as a marquis. Forgetting his state, he returned, same as fish and birds, washing his feet in the Kung Lang, the hazy waters of autumn.

So, for those of you who have been here for the weekend, this is an example of the koan, which is an important and perhaps extraordinary aspect of Zen practice and a body of literature, of religious and spiritual literature, that has the express purpose of being practiced—of being an aspect of meditation—which is really true of virtually everything in Buddhism.

When you think of Buddhist artwork, for the most part those pieces of art are intended to be used in meditation. And so the koan—they have these classical formats: there's a pointer, there's a main case (which is the koan itself, where the student sits with as a meditation), and there's the verse. Each koan is pointing to some fundamental aspect of the student. It's a way to very directly and ultimately non-conceptually, free of the intellect, free of ideas, to have a direct encounter with one's self, with nature, the nature of things, the nature of the world.

Buddhism traces its history to Bodhidharma, the Indian monk who came to China and who is said to have presented Zen as a special transmission outside the scriptures, that doesn't rely on words and letters. It's a direct pointing to the human mind and the realization of Buddhahood or enlightenment.

And so what about all these words and letters? What about these sutras that are so abundant within Buddhism and certainly in the Zen tradition? I mean, here's a bunch right here, and I'm adding to it. So what about all of this?

How is Buddhism in the South? Dijiang asks his student Zhishan, who has come to be a student. ""There's extensive discussion."" And extensive discussion tends to lead to more discussion. Meanwhile, time is swiftly passing by when there's no real affinity with those teachings, or they're just words. They might be intriguing, they might be interesting, they might provide interesting conversation, but that might be it.

But for somebody within whom something is stirring, those words—the teachings that a person encounters—can ignite a fire or fan the flames of a fire that's begun to burn. They're not just words. Hopefully, ultimately, and maybe even in the immediate, the student is not primarily interested in a discussion.

Dijiang lived in the 9th and early 10th century China, was a student of Zhuangshi, and Zhishan was one of his students.

The pointer says, ""Scholars plow with the pen, orators with the tongue."" People use different things to do different things. Patch-robed mendicants just lazily watch a white ox on open ground. The white ox is the self. So the monastics study themselves lazily, in a relaxed way, are watching the self—studying this self on open ground. Let it be open, not constricted. There's no need to confine this ox. It comes into practice confined, right? We don't want to confine it further, but we do need to pay attention or it's going to wander off into the woods, into the weeds. It'll get lost.

So when Zhishan came to Dijiang, Dijiang asked him, ""Where do you come from?"" And the footnote to that says, ""Can you say he doesn't already know where he comes from?"" That is, Dijiang is not really asking him where did he sleep last night, or from where did he travel. Where are you coming from right now? Are you coming from yesterday? Are you coming from tomorrow? Are you coming from confusion? Do you remember the question I just asked you? Where is the you that seems to come and go right now?

Zhishan said, ""From the South."" He's a monastic. He's been in monasteries, training in the South of China. Dijiang said, ""How is it going down there? How's Buddhism these days in the South?"" And Zhishan said, ""There's extensive discussion.""

We could talk about Buddha Dharma all day and night and nothing would change. We all enter practice with our thinking minds, right? Having spent so much of our life with that thinking mind and our thoughts, we trust them, we might love them. We will find them hard to let go of. But if the person is ready, then something is stirring. There's already some understanding about those thoughts, this mind, about how far it can take you, where it can take you, where is it that you want to go? And that's where, when we encounter the teachings for the first time—you know, it's said that when the student is ready, the teacher appears. In a certain sense, the teacher's always there. The teacher's always ready, just waiting for the student to appear. And sometimes that begins with encountering a teaching, some words, and feeling something stir. It's like meeting some ancient part of yourself. And then in that moment, it's like an awareness—like there's already something that you know, something that's being, like a string on an instrument that's being plucked, and the string next to it resonates, vibrates in tune.

Sometimes it's as though a person hears those words for the first time, and it's like you've been waiting your whole life to hear those words. Somebody understands.

When I was young, my girlfriend was a little older than me and she had a car. I don't know how I got her to do this, but I talked her into going to different churches on Sunday. And because I was not a church-going lad, after a while, for a long while—you know, I was a teenager, so I knew pretty much everything—I thought, ""Religion is bullshit, you know, that has nothing for me."" But then I thought, well, you know, there are a whole lot of people who would disagree. So I thought, what's going on in there? So I'd get her to—we'd go to different churches in Atlanta. There wasn't a lot to choose from, frankly. But we'd go and I would just listen and watch and think, is there something going on here? Right? Is there something that I don't—I'm an outsider, I don't understand really what this is. But I was just listening. I was just hearing. I was trying to sense, is there something alive? 

And then when I first encountered Buddhism, it was like, ""Oh, yes.""

There's a story that Zhishan was traveling with two of his monastic brothers, Fayan and Wudang. And they came to Dijiang's monastery. It was snowing and cold, and they got sort of cloistered there for a while because they couldn't travel. So the first night, they were huddled around the charcoal burner trying to get warm, and they were ignoring Dijiang, which is not polite, and they were just having their own conversation.

So Dijiang sort of shimmied up and said, ""I wonder if I could ask you monks something, a question."" They said, ""Sure, if there's something you want to ask, we'd be happy to help out."" And Dijiang said, ""Are the mountains, rivers, and earth identical or separate from you elders?"" And Zhishan said, ""Separate."" And then Zhishan said, ""Identical, identical."" And Dijiang held up two fingers and then he walked away.

And Fayan said, ""What do you think he was getting at, holding up two fingers?"" And Zhishan said, ""He just did that arbitrarily."" And Fayan said, ""I don't know. Don't be so quick to insult him."" The next day, they took off to leave. And Fayan, who went on to be an important teacher in his own right, said, ""You brothers go ahead. I'm going to stay behind and see if Dijiang has something to offer. If I don't find that, then I'll come and find you."" They all came back. They all ended up coming back. And Zhishan went on to become a successor.

Are they separate or the same? There's extensive discussion going on down South.

So there's a question, in a sense, in Buddhist practice: what is the role of your thinking mind? Of course, you know, our thoughts, our distracted thoughts, our kind of habitual thinking, our obsessive thinking, you know, those are cloud-making, right? They really obscure the natural clarity of our mind. They make it very difficult to develop mindfulness and concentration. So we have to work with that mind, with those distractions. That's pretty clear and obvious, and I think every meditator understands that.

But at a deeper level, what is the role of the more powerful aspect of our mind, which has the ability to reason, to think, to think critically, to engage something and try and understand it? What is the role of that? Does it have a role?

And one teacher said, you might wonder how logic and reasoning can cause us to realize what is beyond concepts. How can that which is based in concepts help us to go beyond concepts? And how could such an intellectual approach take us beyond our intellect? Usually, we think of this as meditation's role, right? To let go of all of that and move beyond.

But there are schools of Buddhism and lineages and teachers who believe that the role of reasoning is important, emphasized. And I should say that there are differences of opinion around this, right? There are teachers and very important, powerful, respected lineages and teachers that feel that it has a very minimal role. But in here, this teacher is saying, because it's difficult to realize the true nature of reality and attain liberation without first developing certainty in emptiness, then reasoning is important. Reasoning is emphasized.

And I would say not just certainty—that is, having faith in something that we don't know yet, we haven't experienced. And so there are teachings that try and cultivate, through reasoning, a faith in emptiness. And I would also say what's important is, in that process, to understand what does that even mean? What does emptiness even mean? Because it's just a word in English. And if, when we hear that word, and as I think almost probably all of us did—I certainly did—I started imagining different ways: what is emptiness? It's a big black hole. It's outer space. It's a tunnel you fall into and never come out of. You know, it's like, what is emptiness? And it's none of those things.

So to actually develop a good understanding of it, having an opinion that things are empty, or a general understanding of emptiness, isn't really going to do much good. Emptiness doesn't appear to our senses, right? We can't touch it. And so we don't ordinarily think about it because it's not something we encounter in our senses. Since it is one of the most profound and unfamiliar topics, we need explanations and study to come to terms with it.

We already believe there are so many reasons that things exist. That's where we start. Of course things exist. And each of these reasons need to be examined so that we can develop confidence that maybe that way of seeing things ain't necessarily so.

And so in practice, particularly in our tradition and with Bodhidharma's teachings on being outside scriptures, there's a tendency to think meditating, being free of all thoughts, being free of all rational thinking, is better—right? Is better than having thoughts, than thinking, than having rational, conceptual thoughts. So we rank them. But ultimately they have to be unified, or we have to realize them as unified. If we're going to be active, integrated, living bodhisattvas on an enlightening path, we're not going to leave our thinking mind behind.

So to actually really understand it and not put it in rank. Of course, in the beginning, we're so default to the thinking mind that we do need to be sort of dedicated to freeing ourselves of that and developing this more stable mind, but not to judge it in the ways that we tend to do. Do not judge by any standards, we chanted this morning.

And so we tend to, in this way and other ways, make assumptions about what practice is, about what we should be doing, about what is right and wrong, what is good and bad. And a lot of times we're just making that stuff up based on what we already know, based on the way we've lived our lives, what we already think is true and what is not true.

Of course, we have to use standards in many aspects of our life. We have to guide ourselves in zazen. So in a sense, the standard that we guide ourselves with are the teachings: am I practicing according to the Dharma, if I want to be practicing Buddha Dharma? But we can forget or lose sight of the fact that those standards are created. They don't exist in any absolute sense. That's why Buddhism really speaks in terms of what is skillful, what is helpful, rather than what is absolute truth or absolute non-truth. Because those standards by which we judge things become part of our identity, our attachments.

So the angry mind, the greedy mind, the greedy heart uses the standards that arise out of such a mind, out of such a heart, to see the world, to experience things, to see other people, to relate. And anger and greed and pride and jealousy—the kleshas—will always create more separation and will ultimately always be used against someone, something. Those kleshas, by themselves, in and of themselves, in a sense motivated by those very strong, deeply embedded emotions, lead us to create ranks and hierarchies and elevate and degrade and exclude and include, and ultimately to create a whole—as the Buddha said—a whole mass of suffering.

I was listening to a historian recently, and she said, you know, in every society, in every culture, there's the question of who has the power. Is it the church? Is it a government? Is it a dictator? And of course, in our country, what was established a long time ago is it's supposed to be the people. That's where the power lies—it's the people.

She said that the nature of power is when somebody has it, they want more. Frederick Douglass said, ""Power does not yield in and of itself."" Right? We don't want to give it up. And so then the question becomes, for a Buddhist: for whose benefit is that power being wielded? To what end? What is it being used for?

You could say that in Buddhist practice, you're developing what is sometimes referred to as a spiritual power, right? And it is a kind of power. When your mind settles, there's a kind of power. You feel it. When your body comes into alignment, there's a power. You might think of it as energy. You might think of it as a loss of tension. We might sort of describe it to ourselves in different ways, but it's a kind of power that's being brought forth, that exists within us. For whose benefit is that power? To what end?

This historian was talking about Trump responding to these tariffs for which the world and the stock market and economy is, you know, tanking. And he sent out a note saying, ""This is a great time to get rich, richer than ever before. Only the weak will fail."" And there we have it. Kind of sums it up. Who wants the power and for what reason and for whose benefit?

And so hundreds, thousands—hundreds of thousands of people gathered yesterday, many of you. Thank you for your service on all of our behalf, to try and get things clear. There's extensive discussion. It's exhausting.

The Buddha said, one of the four forms of speech which is not right speech is idle chatter. Oh, my Lord, did he ever—could he have ever guessed how much idle chatter was possible to be endured? It is not neutral. We know that. Even when the words themselves are clearly not neutral, just the noise itself is not neutral. It has an effect to exhaust, to tire, to numb.

Zhishan says, ""There's extensive discussion."" Dijiang says, ""Well, how can that compare to me here planting the fields and making rice to eat?"" How can that compare? Is he just talking about ranks? ""What I'm doing is much better than having discussion."" Well, that would seem obvious, but in a koan it's never what seems obvious. Because if it's obvious, everybody would get that. And what difference has that made? None. And so we always have to look deeper.

How can that compare? There's a moment in which there is no comparison. The subject and object fall away. This moment is not standing in relationship to another. Think about when you're bored. You know, what is boredom? You're sitting and you're bored, right? Where's your mind? Where's your breath? In that moment, are you actually sitting? Because boredom can only happen when this moment stands in comparison to some other possible moment that's a whole bunch better. When there is just this moment, how could there be boredom?

How can that compare to me here planting the fields and making rice to eat? He's talking about a way of being, about a way of planting a field, planting rice.

I was reading this article about this company that's one of many who's building robots, and they were touting the humanoid form and teaching it to do, like, household things like washing dishes, sweeping a floor, those things so that you never have to do them again. Oh, my God, I've been waiting. How far can we go to degrade and minimize and belittle the ordinary things of living? Well, clearly, so that we—because we have better things to do. Like TikTok. Right? It's frightening because it's so seductive. I won't have to do that anymore. I won't have to wash any dishes. I won't have to clean my bathroom.

Has that person ever actually cleaned their dishes? Have they ever actually cleaned a bathroom? That's what you're given the opportunity to do here when you come here, is to actually clean a bathroom in a way that cannot compare. Not because it's the brightest, cleanest bathroom ever and you have won, but because there's nothing outside of that. There's no before, there's no after.

And so he says, ""Well, what can you do about the world?"" And he says, ""What do you call the world?""

I've been reading Ed Yong's book, An Immense World, and he talks about—I'll only read a little bit of this—but he talks about the very beginning: ""Imagine an elephant in a room, and in that room there's a real elephant."" He says, ""It's not the elephant in the room. No, it's an actual elephant. It's an elephant. There's a mouse, there's a robin, there's an owl, there's a bat, there's a rattlesnake, there's a spider, there's a mosquito, there's a bumblebee. And there's a woman. Let's call her Rebecca,"" he says. They're all in this room.

He says, ""The elephant raises his trunk like a periscope. The rattlesnake flicks out its tongue. The mosquito cuts through the air with its antenna. All three are smelling. All of them are in the act of smelling what there is to smell in that room. The elephant sniffs. Nothing of note. The rattlesnake detects the trail of the mouse and gets ready to strike. The mosquito smells the alluring carbon dioxide on Rebecca's breath and the aroma of her skin.""

And he goes on to talk about how each of these creatures, these living beings in this room, are in the same room at the same time, having very different experiences. What do you call the world?

He says Rebecca has the clearest eyesight of everybody in the room—until the lights go out. Plunged into darkness, she's in trouble, but some of the other creatures are now ready to go.

He says these seven creatures share the same physical space, but experience it in wildly and wondrously different ways. The same is true for the billions of other animal species on the planet and the countless individuals within those species. Earth teems in sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal can only tap into a small fraction of reality's fullness or completeness. Each is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense world.

And that's really important, I think, as practitioners, for us to bear in mind, because the teachings also often talk about that we're going to experience reality as it is, as though there is an objective reality out there that we can experience without our senses and that we will experience that same objective reality—like the elephant and the bat and the robin and the mosquito.

Buddhism is concerned with the human world. And so we have to practice with this human form using our human senses. And in fact, realization, enlightenment—even though the thing itself of enlightenment, what is realized, is beyond concept—it's not realization until it comes into cognition. Until it comes into cognition, there's no realization. There's nothing that has been realized. And so in that sense, what is ineffable, what is beyond any sense organ, has to, in some strange way that words can't really describe, come into a sense of something kind of interesting.

Our world appears to us as the world. And historically, when other creatures have an experience—like when we test intelligence of animals, we test them according to what we think intelligence is. And if they can't do those, perform those functions, then we think, okay, this animal doesn't have any intelligence. If you set the standards of the test, you are sure to rank high, right? If you're deciding what counts, isn't that kind of like the reference field of the self? The self decides, sets the standards for what matters, what doesn't, who's in, who's out, what's smart, what's not, who's worthy, who's not.

He says there's a word for this. It's called ""umwelt."" It's the field in which we have sensory awareness. And I was thinking, you know, a person who lives by anger, lives by greed, who is thrilled, whose umwelt is ""richer than ever, and only the weak will fail""—if they were in the same room as an enlightened being, a bodhisattva, could that person appreciate, have any sensory experience of the bodhisattva's world? They certainly have the capacity because we all have the same nature. But is their umwelt so different that they actually can't experience that, that the suffering of that other person is outside their umwelt? Their senses are not tuned or not practiced or not alive to experience.

And remember, one of the sense organs is the mind, which means thought, which means belief, views. So the mind is sensing things through our thoughts and creating logic and reason and worlds and ideologies. And so in that way, of course, a person whose life, whose mind, whose umwelt is very limited, is going to replicate that by creating a very confined and constricted and limited life and world. And all of those creatures—two-legged and more—who are not recognized as having intelligence or having the qualities that the standards within this other umwelt have established, they don't matter, they don't count. When the umwelt of a country is defined by race or gender or wealth or power, then even an elephant could deceive itself into believing that its world is the world.

So I wanted to—I've been drawing a little bit from this book by Wendell Berry that I've been reading. I finally finished it, so I can't promise this will be the last time I draw from it. But he speaks to this in a way that I found useful. He's actually talking about Albert Schweitzer, the Christian missionary, musician, physician, philosopher, and about—he was sort of talking about the material progress, technological, industrial progress, and ethical progress.

He says it became obvious that there was never a possibility that ethical progress would or could ever develop in union or in parallel with material progress. Material progress was never going to wait for ethics to catch up. I think that's just a very true and succinct way of describing—it's just right. Can't hold back progress. And progress means something very—it's a very particular umwelt, right? Ethics, you know, if you can squeeze it in. But that's not really what's important here.

And so Schweitzer came to a realization of what he called ""reverence for life,"" which he described. He said a person is ethical only when life as such is sacred to them, and that of plants and animals, and when they devote themselves helpfully to all life that is in need of help. That is reverence for life. It's large. It includes everything, right?

So when we think about, you know, what is good for humanity, what do we need to do to take care of the human species—all of the things that are important—but as though we're alone, as though if we can just make it good for humans, then everything else will be okay.

He talks about people who have revered—this is Wendell Berry—who have revered life and those who still revere it, and that there have been people forever, since the beginning, and there are still many who revere life. I would say, venture to guess, there are a few in this room. It's hard to practice Buddha Dharma for long and not to begin to experience life in a different way and begin to touch something that we might even timidly, shyly, even reluctantly begin to think of as sacred. I was very timid about that. I was like, ""I don't know about that. I don't know."" That was sort of a loaded word for me. But there was a point at which it was just undeniable—there's something going on here. There's something going on here.

And he says to those for whom life begins to be understood as reverent, he says it has appeared to them to be a great miracle. That's why there's reverence. Unaccountable on the terms of available knowledge—can't explain it. He says that is because life—life itself—is not a substance. It's not a thing. That's why it's a miracle. That's why it is of reverence. He says air and light are oak and iron in comparison to life itself. And he says because of this, because it's not a thing, because it's not a substance, he says life itself has never been isolated or captured or confined. You can't buy it. It's not a piece of real estate. You can only give it value in your heart, right? There's no stock on Wall Street.

He says we can see how generous and abounding is the commonwealth of life in comparison to that merely of humans or humanity, and how fairly—we could almost say how democratically—it is portioned out among the creatures: a mouse, a horse, a butterfly, a fly, a microbe. They all have their own portion of life.

He says his life is not isolatable, is not isolatable or empirically knowable. This is just another way of saying it's not reducible. It can't be reduced. It can't be reduced to money, to a house, to a job, to a position, a role. It's not isolatable. It cannot be made into anything that it's not. It's not a thing. It's not something that we can have only for ourselves or something we can compete for or take away from others and so have more for ourselves. Our life can be made more abundant, as Jesus said, but not by any quantifiable amount. Wendell Berry is a Christian. We cannot have life for ourselves alone, but only in common with other living creatures.

We were talking earlier in the week how you—you can't have morality by yourself. Doesn't make sense. You can't have language by yourself. We can only have it together. Doesn't exist as an isolatable thing. And in that way, it's not quantifiable, right? How much morality did you have today? Right. Can you gain a little of that moral weight? It's not like that. But we know it when it's present; we see it when it's not. But that's not morality. It's what we do with our morality or our lack of it.

He says we and our kind must live, if we are to live for very long. In order to live for very long, we need to obey absolutely nature's requirements to keep all of her places healthful and whole. And to waste nothing, we need to use sparingly, carefully, kindly, and gratefully all that we must use.

Buddhism has been practicing this way for centuries: to take care of what we have, to have just enough. When we take our formal meals, oryoki, it means the right amount. And here specifically, we're talking about food, but it's in relationship to my hunger. What is the right amount? What is the necessary amount? The amount that is reverential of life? What is the amount that is obeying nature's laws? Because they don't change, right? We can't bend them.

And we can say that we have to live according to our own natural laws. We call that Dharma. But the thing is, as human beings, we don't have to. And when we don't, those laws don't bend, right? We can defy impermanence, but impermanence is a natural law. It's not debatable, right? We can try to defy death, but that's just magical thinking, right? We can think that attachment is the same as love, but it's not. These are basic truths, basic laws.

When we live, when we obey them, live in accord with them, we flourish, life flourishes, life has reverence. When we don't, we desecrate what is sacred. As we are not whole in ourselves when divided from other humans, Wendell Berry says, so we are not whole as humans when divided from all other creatures. So we are not whole as creatures when divided from the earth, from a home country, and the landmarks and the reminders of a home country, from those places of sacredness that we each have. And if we do not have them, they're there.

This is a place that is sacred for many of us. Why? Is it the architecture? Is it the building? The architecture is quite marvelous, right? If we were in a warehouse, it wouldn't be quite the same. But sacredness ultimately is not in the space—it, in a sense, draws. If there is natural beauty in the space, it draws that out, magnifies it. But what makes this space sacred, I believe, is what has been happening in this space for 45 years and in a sense, by extension, for 2,500 years.

And so then, as we—those of us who practice here—something starts to happen. There's a kind of a bonding, a binding, a kinship, something alive, a reverence that goes in both directions, a kind of nourishment. Sometimes people speak of it as coming home. These are not quantifiable things. You can feel it, but you can't possess it. Nobody's given it to you, but you are definitely part of it.

He says we are now down to one significant choice. We can take our stand either on the side of life or on the side of death. Now, of course, Buddhism sees these as non-dual, because they are. So another way of saying this is we can either live in a way that is in accord with the nature of things, or we can live in a way that is not in accord with the nature of things. This will never be presented to us as one large and final choice, but only as a succession of small choices, continuing to the 7th and 700th generation.

I think that's an extremely important point, right? Because when we see the world in a state—I mean, don't you just want the final solution, right? The ultimate fix that's just going to, like, fix it. And what Berry is saying is what we understand as practitioners: you don't get to the top of the mountain in a leap. You have to walk one simple, small, seemingly insignificant step at a time. And in the same way, to be a practitioner means we have to make choices each day—to sit, to practice, to be mindful, to care, to take responsibility, to examine. And we have to keep making those choices. But we can do that because they're just today's choices. You don't have to make one choice forever. Nobody has. Nobody can do that. It's just now, it's like every time you're sitting in a moment, your mind wanders, you make a choice, right? And then you just do that again. You do that. And the more we do that, the easier it begins to be to make that choice until it's not really a choice anymore, it's just your life. And that life has reverence.

And I think that's really important in terms of, like, yesterday's rally. That was happening all across the country. It was happening in other countries. Did it work, right? Did it work? Has everything changed? No, everything has not changed. Has something changed? Yes, because what happened today or yesterday created karma. Because you had hundreds of thousands of people with minds, with intentions, coming together, sharing something and expressing it in some sense, I would venture to say, of things moving frighteningly out of accord and trying to bring it back into accord. Let's actually obey the laws that we live within—of nature, of the earth, of Buddha nature, of a civil society.

And so as a practitioner, to ask ""Did it work?"" is not the right question. That's not a helpful question. It's rather, is this a good use of my time? Is this a good action? Is this an intentionally good action? What do I want to do with this? Not what is the consequence of it? Because that will stop us.

So I'll let Wendell have the last word. He says, ""If we worked for the world's life in good faith, with sufficient love and knowing how our work would become good—"" I have to read that again. ""If we worked for the world's life in good faith, with sufficient love and knowing how our work would become good, our work itself would be good. Because we're working for the life of the world, and we're doing that within good faith—we could say good understanding, clear views—and we're doing it with sufficient love, compassion, concern. Sufficient. He doesn't say total, complete, absolute—sufficient.""

And he says, ""In this way, it would become beautiful, it would make us happy. And not with the future happiness of political promising, it would make us happy as soon as we began to do it.""

Maybe those who are coming to practice for the first time have had a sense of something, even when it's difficult, that in those first moments, it is the beginning of something that is good, even if you don't yet know why or what or how.

This is from Bodhidharma's Bloodstream Sermon:

Buddha means awareness, the awareness of body and mind that prevents evil from arising in either. To invoke means to call to mind, to call constantly to mind the rules of discipline, and to follow them with all your might. This is what's meant by invoking. Invoking has to do with thought and not language. If you use a trap to catch a fish, once you succeed, you forget the trap. And if you use language to find meaning, once you find it, you can forget the language.

To invoke the Buddha's name, you have to understand the Dharma of invoking. If it's not present in your mind, your mouth chants an empty name. As long as you're troubled by the three poisons—which are greed, anger, and ignorance—or by thoughts of yourself, your deluded mind will keep you from seeing the Buddha, and you'll only waste your effort. Chanting and invoking are worlds apart. Chanting is done with the mouth. Invoking is done with the mind. And because invoking comes from the mind, it's called the door to awareness. Chanting is centered in the mouth and appears as sound. If you cling to appearances while searching for meaning, you won't find a thing. Thus, sages of the past cultivated introspection, not speech.

So, I've been thinking a lot about liturgy, and I wanted to give a talk on liturgy. And so I started to work on that, and I realized I can't. I can't talk about liturgy because it's experiential, for sure. And it's hard to teach this invocation of our mind, where we are in our mind. So, I'm going to do my best to speak about liturgy.

We had a precepts retreat yesterday, and the word ""opening"" came up. And that really struck me, this word opening—opening this door to awareness, being opened, being uncovered, unfolding. Seems like the right season to talk about opening. After all, that's sort of the force that's happening. Things are opening.

What is it to be open? What is it to be open to liturgy and be opened by liturgy? And so this is one of the eight gates that Daido set up—this gate of liturgy, which he calls, in his chapter in the Eight Gates, ""Making visible the invisible."" If that's not a koan for us, what is? Making visible the invisible.

Liturgy for me today—and I hope maybe you'll feel it—is really helpful in this time, in this present time, since it is perceived and subtly answered that our thought, what we do with our mind, has a lot of reverberations and a sense. Like what we chanted this morning is, we're all doing good speech together. We're creating a ritual of good speech and putting that out there, letting that reverberate.

Kaz Tanahashi did a book on Zen chanting. And he wrote, ""A Zen chant is like a compass that sets us in the direction of the awakened life. It is the dynamic audible counterpart to the silent practice of zazen. And it is a powerful expression of the fact that practice happens in community.""

So, Daido says in this—he has this book called The Eight Gates of Zen, for those that are new. That's our training matrix, ways that we train based on the Eightfold Path of the Buddha. And he starts off—I'll just say a little bit about his words:

""Just as in the arts of painting, poetry, music and dance, so in Zen liturgy, we manifest that which is known to us intuitively and subconsciously in the form of a visible, tangible reality. In this way, liturgy tends to make palpable the common experience of a group. There is, however, very little explanation of liturgy generally available. It is rare to see a substantive work on the subject in Buddhism or in any other major religion, because it is experiential.""

It's a very direct experience. And I know in my first encounters with Zen liturgy, my brain was crackling. I mean, even to read, ""it's the common experience of a group,"" I'm like, what does common mean now? What is experience and what's a group? I don't know. It puts everything into question. I can't take for granted that I understand any of these simple words, anything, as well as to presume anything about this mysterious, non-self espoused in Buddha Dharma.

So there's a whole different cast on words. I remember when I first came to the monastery, just like some of you this morning, right into liturgy, the morning service, and the person greeted me at the front door. They said, ""Welcome."" And they said, ""We're going to start with morning service. There's going to be some chanting and bowing. You okay with that?"" And I was like, I don't know, what does that mean? Like, what kind of bow? Like, bowing? I don't know. Sure, I can bow. Full prostrations. I was like, okay, yeah, okay. So, yeah, I'm okay with that.

And so the bell starts, and it's like the whole community just started, like, moving around like we do. Some people were sitting, and then everyone knew, like, it was time to stand up and take this place. And I don't know, it was very earthy. It was like we were all just—and everyone was barefoot. Like, that really was so exciting to me that we took our shoes off and we're just, like, raw, touching the earth. I used to make latkes with my grandmother. She used to say, ""Take your shoes off. It's going to taste better."" And the food tastes better. So I was remembering that. I was like, oh, okay, this is going to taste really good. We're barefoot, no hats. You know, everything just sort of in.

And I felt like, oh, there's this, like... there's like, a ritual taking place here. Like, there's incense happening and instruments, and some people had robes. I didn't. And people had positions, and they seemed to know what to do. And I was just really like, wow, this thing's just going along really nicely with precision and with care. And something spoke really powerfully to my heart and mind in those moments, which I can't articulate, but maybe you feel it, too. It just starts to, like, move in us, right? That's the liturgy happening, the ritual and how we appreciate ritual.

And this felt celebratory, and it also felt kind of sublime. And everyone was silent. Some people were looking down. And so I was kind of peeking because I didn't know what was going on, and I didn't know about lowering my eyes. That was something to really trust. And then I received a sutra book. And then there's these words, like a Heart Sutra. And I was like, a Heart Sutra? What could that be? A Heart Sutra? And then I heard, ""Form is emptiness and emptiness is form."" And so the chant's going along, and I'm still on that phrase and seeing, like, did anybody hear that? Like, what is that?

And then the Identity of Relative and Absolute. Like, what is that truth? What is truth? Like, this is the truth, not a lie. And I'm like, what's the truth and not a lie? And do I agree with that? And all kinds of stuff, sound syllables, just like, ""No mo san..."" And I was just like, okay, I'm here to do it. I'm going to do it. So I just tried to keep opening and opening.

And I remember, I'm bowing. It's not like I—I don't know if I had bowed before. It was different in the religion I was brought up in, but I didn't know where everyone went. Like, everyone dropped down to the floor. And I was really nervous about that because suddenly you can't see anything. So I was again peeking out the side. And then it's like raising the Bodhi mind. It's like the Buddha's on—you're holding the Buddha on the palm of your hands and you raise the Buddha by your ears, you're raising your Bodhi mind. That's what I found out later. And putting your hands down. So I did that too. I did everything.

And there was this feeling of like just open and just surrender, doing the best I could, trying to stay in curiosity and wonder. And you know, a lot of us come into Zen with our backgrounds in religion and Zen is said to be non-theistic. So it doesn't take up whether or not there exists a God as being relevant to seeing the nature of oneself, one's nature. But a lot of us have a lot of discomfort with bowing. And nothing's external in Zen liturgy. So it's all an expression of identity. So when we have a Buddha on the altar, we're identifying with our own wakefulness and these are just reminders of who we are. So it's identity.

But there's a lot of—many people have discomfort. And even with rituals, like, I like the sitting part, like the talk, but I don't like the liturgy. In fact, my teacher, Daido Roshi, used to sneak out when he was in training in ZCLA. He would leave when liturgy started. And so we have these people that watch the zendo and they would see him going. He had this pattern of like, liturgy started and out he went. And he said he would go to the diner and get a sandwich and then come back when the teacher was going to talk. And so Tetsugen and his Dharma brothers would get ready and Maezumi would say, ""Let him go."" His teacher would say, ""Let him go. I see it. Let him go.""

And he did this for a while and he was just watching him. And then somewhere along that line, his son became ill, had a brain tumor, three-year-old son. And Daido went in to his teacher and he said, ""Well, would it be okay if the Sangha chanted for your son on the healing list?"" And there was Daido, like, oh boy, you know, liturgy. And he was, at that point, he was just open. Maezumi went right for it. And from that point on, he was so moved by liturgy and what it was doing for him and the Sangha, the community, like putting all this energy towards his son that was ill, that it became very—one of the most important practices for Daido. So that's why it is a lot of what we do here.

And, you know, sometimes we have discomfort with ritual, but all throughout our day, if you look at it, your day—isn't there ritual? I mean, you get up, you put your feet on the floor, you maybe go and make something to drink, or you go to the bathroom. That's your ritual. And then you have a certain drink. And then maybe you take a shower. And then maybe you sit, maybe you will sit, maybe you dance. I don't know. And all through the day, there's order that we make in things we do. That's ritual, right? But somehow we come here and it's like there's too much ritual.

So this is where it involves staying open. Because we can't base things on what we might assume or what we've been brought up to. At least if we can be open, we can say, oh, that's coming up. Let me ask a few more questions. Be curious. Is this what I did years ago that really turned me off? And da, da, da.

And so Maezumi Roshi, I wanted to share with you—he writes a chapter in his book on ""Let Us Appreciate"" on ceremonial action. He says it's interesting to reflect on how many of the most basic routines of our lives are conducted in an orderly way within a particular form. When our actions are conducted in this way, they become ceremony. What is ceremony? And then he says in Latin, ceremony is ""ceremonia,"" which is related to ""cura,"" which means cure, the act of healing or of being healed. In other words, ceremony is an act that cures or heals or by which something is healed. In having a ceremony or in doing ceremonial action, we must ask what is healed by what?

You know, sometimes when people are ill, I say, there is one who is not ill taking care of the ill person even as we're sick. And I remember that myself as I'm laying down, tucked in the covers, drinking water, doing what I have to do. There is one who is not ill, taking care.

The word ""heal"" means to be healthy, to be whole and sound, to make our life healthy is ceremonial. In order to live a healthy life, we live ceremonially every day, regardless of our culture, country, or race. From morning to night, we live our lives through rituals, don't we? We get up, we wash our face, we brush our teeth. And Dogen has a lot of fascicles—Master Dogen—on these very rituals we do; we brush our teeth and eat, go about our simple routines in an orderly way. Work can be an act of ceremony. Wouldn't that be nice? Like, if you think of your work as like, I'm going to a ceremony, and you go in the office, you say hello to everyone. That's part of the ceremony. It's part of the ritual. ""How you doing today?"" ""Oh, really? What's up?"" So you can think now of your entire day as being in liturgy, in ceremony. It's nice.

The definition of ceremony also includes the word ""law,"" the laws of life. From morning until night, our life is a continuous ritual governed by rules, regulations, and laws. Behaving informally, we follow the laws or regulations. What are the laws and regulations that are essential to living a healthy life? What do we follow? What do we abide by? It's interesting, he says, who do you think creates the casual, disorderly way of life? I do. The ego does.

Ceremony can be understood as a form of discipline by which we avoid self-centeredness, which causes us difficulties. And there's much more if you want to go to his book on Let Us Appreciate.

So Daido speaks about making visible the invisible. Give you a chance to let your brain crackle with that for a moment. And in his book he says—this is from ""Celebrating Everyday Life""—what does it mean to make visible something which is invisible? He says, essentially it means to bring that something into the awareness of the six consciousnesses, which we chanted this morning: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. And in addition, the five awarenesses: hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching. And then the five organs, that is your nose, tongue, and body.

And so he says Buddhism identifies mind itself as an organ that perceives. The organ of perception and the object it perceives, together with consciousness, produce what we call reality. So you need an organ of perception, an object of perception, and consciousness. If any of those are not there, there's no reality. So a thing becomes real—what we call real—when the organ of perception, its object, and consciousness come together. My eye, the object that it sees, and consciousness combine to form a tangible reality.

He says when you consider mind as one of the organs of perception, the concept of reality expands beyond the boundaries usually accepted in the West. He says the object of mind is thought. Mind, thought, and consciousness thus create a reality. Making visible means we are able to perceive through the organs of perception that something is there, though invisible. What is it that is invisible? What is the common experience of the Buddhist community that is restated in our liturgy?

So just before we start a talk, if you remember what we just did, the big keisaku started over here, got our attention, vibrated—bong, bong. We're all silent, hands are going to gassho, which is an expression of unifying one reality. And then we chant this gatha on opening the sutra:

""The Dharma, incomparably profound and infinitely subtle, is rarely encountered even in millions of ages. Now we see it, we hear it, we receive and we maintain it. May we completely realize the Tathagata's true meaning.""

I think one of the most important words is ""now."" Now, this present moment. We see it, we hear it, we receive and we maintain it, making visible the invisible. The past is gone, future hasn't happened yet. Neither of those is reality. Only in this moment, right? This is it. Right now is what we have. This strange and wondrous now that just slipped—and there's now, and just went, and now and now and now and now and now and now. Because we can't grasp it. Because it doesn't have a length, it doesn't have substance. If that ain't wondrous, I don't know what is.

So this is a gatha, which is a short poem or a verse—gatha on opening the sutra. So, opening. What is opening for you? What is opening for you? Most of us want to be open. We definitely want to have openings. People come and tell me, ""I want an opening,"" but it's happening all the time. Maybe it's allow access, not playing at the entrance.

We brought this up in the precept. Somebody said opening is to be impacted by surrendering, accepting. What exactly is being opened in this sutra? What is the sutra? So, to see the Dharma, we need to let go of our limited ways of measuring things. It's just not... We see it, we hear it, we receive and uphold its power boundlessness openly.

And Buddha woke up out of the sleep of what he thought he was, into the reality of what each of us really is now. The origin of this sutra—there's a lot of... I didn't spend a whole lot of time, but it is in the Lotus Sutra and chapter on Expedient Means, skillful means. But it's said it has origins in China. They found something very similar in about 500 to 700 CE, but the counts vary. Anyways.

Our true nature is vast open space. That's our true nature—boundless. We hear it, so we may feel some things pushing against, which might be our beliefs, our strong-held beliefs, our positions, which we can inquire about. So what might I need to open before we start? You know, we say these talks tend to be dark to the mind but radiant to the heart. So there's a little hint. These talks tend to be dark to the mind but radiant to the heart. And they require a different kind of listening. Maybe that's part of the meaning of opening and opening the sutra.

The sutra is the scriptures. It's also said to be the words of the Buddha. The Tathagata is another name for Buddha. But sutra, like there's ""suture"" when we get stitched up, is exactly what it is. It says, ""interwoven of strings in vertical and horizontal."" That's sutra—interwoven strings of vertical and horizontal. Isn't that what our human life is? Could we be the sutra? Could you be the sutra? Is that the sutra we're opening? Is this a verse on how to open ourselves to the dharma, to everything interwoven up and down because we're not fixed?

So it's a fast-moving system of momentariness being woven up and down. Constant flow, a dynamic, moving, vast network. A tapestry of threads merging into a constant flow. Looks like this. Looks like this. This kinhin is called a walking sutra. That's what we are. We're all stitched together. Walking, walking, sutra—interwoven steps like stitches.

One teacher wrote, we have to see that clearly, then taste it, to see the real picture of our life—a huge network of interwoven time and space. Even though we see the momentariness or instant that we exist day to day, it consists of a huge network of interwoven time and space. An instant has this kind of vast structure. So if we have clinging or grasping to our own prejudice, if we grasp at our desire at the expense of everything and anyone else we know, it's really... How's that going? It's difficult to open our life. It's a sticky network. And so we can feel that. We can feel it's like a spider web. You know, there's certain things that will get stuck. So we have to practice to open ourself to see the real picture of our life.

And zazen is that, of course. That's where we can practice very directly to open ourselves. Thought arises, we don't judge it. Or maybe we do. We see that we don't have to. We let it go, we open to it. And we open to coming back to our breath, surrendering, allowing access to those fast-moving networks of interwoven time and space.

Now we open our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, and see what's true. And that truth that we see is called the Dharma. Whatever comes to us that we see to be tested and real and true is the Dharma. And Daido used to give us a warning, if you remember. He says, if any teacher tells you, ""I have the truth,"" he said, ""Run for your life. Run for your life."" We need to find out what is real and true and test it in our life. That is opening the sutra.

If, as we open this sutra, the huge network of interweaving time and space, if we do that, we find it is incomparably profound and infinitely subtle, sometimes called ""penetrating Dharma."" So Dharma is a very full Buddhist term. I'm not going to go into Dharma, but just kind of give you these three principles that are, I think, important for now. It's the principle of existence, this Dharma—all phenomena, visible or invisible—and the teachings of the Buddha, mainly compassion that extends everywhere, is the Dharma.

And all of this is at a state—as a category, a state of always functioning at super speed, constantly supporting, helping, and nurturing all beings. If you come to see this state of being, realizing this is true is Dharma. It's said that we will be completely, constantly supported and helped and nurtured. We will feel that.

It's said, the inside needs to be like a hollow, like a reed. You know, sometimes teachers used to speak of kinhin as a hollow reed. Walking, like when we walk kinhin, walk like you're a hollow reed. So we say, you know, let go of counting. And it's the same as zazen. We're just walking. So when thoughts come up, we're not hollow anymore. We're filling ourselves up. You know, should I do this? I can't wait till we go to lunch. Da, da, da, whatever. And we let that go, and we walk like we're hollow. A hollow reed. I like that. It's helpful. Nothing to grasp.

This, too, is a meaning of dharma. Constantly supporting, upholding, helping, nurturing all beings. And the inside is hollow. Not unfeeling, just empty of grasping—that kind of hollow.

The Dharma, incomparably profound, very profound. Some translations say ""penetrating,"" but originally it says ""profound"" or ""profundity."" Deep, unfathomable. This is one of the characteristics of the Zen arts—sublime profundity. And I think of it—I always think of it as when I have a pot with a certain glaze, or I've seen pots with certain glazes, and you look in and you can't tell where the bottom is. You just can't tell the bottom. And it has its form, but you can't see the bottom. You can't see the depth of it. I think of it like that kind of profundity. We cannot touch it, but we can be there. If we can open ourself, open our heart, we can see it and be present exactly in peace and harmony. Right there. This now—it's what's speaking of—is profound, infinitely subtle, wondrously inconceivable. We can't pin it down what it is, but it's working with us. If we can open to it—that's when we fill ourselves with all the things we fill ourselves with—but if we can open, open to it.

Katagiri Roshi continues: ""Meeting it objectively, we cannot know what it is. We can't explain it. Speaking subjectively, we can experience it exactly, we can know. Yet it is with us. Difficult to say what it is objectively is called subtle. Very subtle, infinitely subtle. Our mind cannot pin down what it is. And we can experience it and know it is always with us.""

So Dharma is supreme, incomparably profound, unmatchable, beyond comparison, and subtle, very subtle. Because we can experience it, we can teach it to people, we can transmit it. This is our responsibility. Each of us, whatever Dharma you realize, we let move on. Whatever goodness it brings, we have to transmit this Dharma. And it's rarely encountered, even in millions of ages. Some say kalpas.

What's a kalpa? Now we see it, hear it, receive and maintain it. We rarely meet with, even in hundreds of millions of kalpas of ages. So aren't we the lucky ones? We don't understand how rare it is. I don't. I hear that a lot, but I really—it's beginning to get to me like, wow, it is rare. I mean, 9.5 billion people on the planet, the Dharma to be encountered—it doesn't have to be through Buddhism—ages. Kalpa, that's an expression of time. That's boundless, eternal. Let's just say it's a... when somebody—when you write ""long time."" Very rare for us to be born as human beings. Very rare for us to have the opportunity to meet and listen to Buddhist teachings and practice zazen together.

So those of you that showed up today, I'd love to meet each one of you and say, what was it that you turn to the Dharma? This opportunity to express ourselves as we are. And then maybe we make contact, that it's important to have our spiritual life. We do make contact and to take care of it. And then that spurs us on to pay attention in zazen, which I feel is happening more and more, more and more.

Even those of you—I mean, some of us have sat before. I realized when I was a newcomer, there were a lot of newcomers. Some of us have meditated before in various ways, but it's rare, and we may not get this opportunity again for millions of ages. And now we see it, we hear it, we receive, we accept, and we open to be impacted and maintain it.

And so there's this spiral of practice. We practice it, we realize it, we actualize it, we manifest it, we practice it, we realize it, we actualize it, we manifest it, and that continues endlessly. That's an enlightened life. Buddhism does go for the long view. And when we see the real picture now, that affects the past and it affects our actions going into the future in this now. So it's all one reality. So whatever happened in the past can actually be worked with now and affect that past and how it moves forward. That's how we change things, change karma, work with our karma, our actions, what we make of ourselves through our actions.

""May we completely realize the Tathagata's true meaning."" That's the last line. May we completely realize the Buddha's true meaning, really taste the truth of it, of what the Buddha was saying about our nature, our Buddha nature, being perfect and complete, lacking absolutely nothing—all beings, all things. In that way, never fail to cover the ground upon which they walk.

If practice does have a goal, it's to see the reality of each being—like that included. Putting this one on your cushion doesn't mean we don't have stuff to work on. So don't get confused about perfection. Wondrous and difficult to grasp and not different from the ceremony of our everyday life, day to day.

This is what it is to meet the Dharma, to see it, to hear it, receive and maintain it. And then when we experience that, we can't help but want to understand it more deeply. We keep wanting to deepen ourselves and the Dharma, to realize the Buddha's true meaning once we taste it. That's why Trungpa says, if you start on this path, be careful, because you won't be able to turn back, because now you know something, and it's harder to go against what you know to be true that you've seen and realized. It's hard to turn back. We can try. It's really hard.

So some people, they say, ""I left practice,"" and then they come back, and I'm like, no, you didn't. Not at all. You know, yeah, maybe you didn't show up here, and I haven't seen you for 20 years. But here you are. You haven't left. You never did. You couldn't. Sorry. It's too late. First day you walked in—too late.

So this verse is saying something so vivid and directly about our life. Stay open and let it be this unknowable mystery that it is.

Maezumi Roshi's words: ""When we carefully understand our lives, every bit of life becomes ceremonial action, an open, orderly, ordinary life. And we should take care in this way. This is liturgy. This is ceremony. Do you see?""

And in closing, I'll just share a prayer by—make sure I—by somebody named Dana Faulds. She's a practitioner, I think in—yeah, she's a practitioner. She writes—like, I like her writing because she writes about Dharma, and that can get kind of syrupy sometimes, but I think hers is okay. You'll see. I like it.

I pray to stay open today.
Open to the unrestrained energy of now.
Open to mystery and power.
Open to whatever comes.
Open to routine and surprises.
Open to moving past my first reactions.
Open to my imperfections and the divine spark that underlies them.
Open to the wonder and the everyday grace of life unfolding as it does.
Open to events and circumstances that I like and that I don't like.
Open to fatigue and the overflowing energy.
Open to listen and to speak.
Open to love in all the ways it manifests.
Open to give and to receive.
Open to the seasons, changing priorities, rearranging, nothing staying the same for very long.
Open to letting beliefs dissolve into the etherium.
Open to the direct experience of truth.
Open to forgetting and remembering.
Open to life and open to death.
Open to seeing old patterns and letting them go.
Open to fear and to courage, ease, difficulty.
I pray to stay open.

Thank you for listening.

This is from Dogen Zenji, who is a 12th-century Zen master who wrote ""Instructions for the Cook,"" the monastery cook—Tenzo Kyokun, Instructions for the Cook. So we're going to cook the supreme meal today.

""Never change your attitude according to the materials. If you do, it is like varying your truth when speaking with different people. Then you are not a practitioner of the Way. When you prepare food, do not see with ordinary eyes and do not think with ordinary mind. Take up a blade of grass and construct a treasure king's land. Enter a particle of dust and turn the great Dharma wheel. Taking up a green vegetable, turn it into a 16-foot golden body of Buddha. Take a 16-foot golden body of Buddha and turn it into a green vegetable. Handle even a single leaf of green in such a way that it manifests the body of Buddha. Then this in turn allows the Buddha to manifest through the leaf. This is a power which you cannot grasp with your rational mind. It operates freely according to the situation in a most natural way. This is a miraculous transformation, a work of Buddha that benefits sentient beings.""

So, cooking our life, making our supreme meal together.

Yesterday we had a video here called ""Watching the Rock Grow,"" which I was very inspired by seeing—my teacher, my first teacher, Daido Roshi. The film was made in 1990 and it was about how the monastery was founded and how he set up a training center. What ingredients he had to put in his pot and build this incredible meal of training and practice of the Buddhadharma on this hemisphere—fairly new to Zen. Zen was fairly new to this country, and all these teachers came and were forming centers. So it was the very formative years. It was the year I arrived at the monastery, 1990.

And how he had so many flavors to deal with—bitter, sweet, sour, delicate, strongly scented, weakly scented. And he created these eight areas of training to study this self. One of Daido's teachings, which I'm sure he heard from Dogen and also felt very deeply, was this: engaging and training fully in our everyday activities with mindfulness, dedication, attention to the smallest detail is the enlightened way—it is enlightened in itself. That kind of practice. Take a green vegetable, turn it into a 16-foot golden body of Buddha.

He just loved the teachings of Master Dogen. When I came to Zen Mountain Monastery in 1990, I was there for only a week, and I was made the monastery cook for a year—which I felt very comfortable doing. I loved to cook. And, you know, I came from a clay background, so I was used to working with large amounts of material, and people were part of those ingredients.

When I had one of my first dokusans with Daido Roshi, he said, “I want you to read this fascicle by Dogen Zenji called Instructions for the Cook. It's in a book called Refining Your Life by Uchiyama Roshi.” If you saw the video, I should show it again, but he had a big gap in his teeth—he’s very toothy—and he smiled at me with his big toothy grin. And he said, “We'll get you to see how to take a lettuce leaf and handle it in such a way that it manifests the body of the Buddha.” And I'm like, brand new, wet behind the ears. I was like, “Yeah, sure, okay, right, sure, okay, whatever that means.” And I believe that he assigned it to every cook, and we still do.

One former cook said to me, “It's not reading that book that's difficult. It's actually doing it, what it says.”

So what is it showing us? I'll just pull out parts today about how we prepare this life. What are the ingredients we're finding that we have—our happiness, our depression, our grumpiness, people, things. How does that all become part of the ingredients? Those ingredients have no fixed position. They're ingredients—how can they work for us as we're making this supreme meal together and individually, our life, moment to moment, with all that's presented to us, working in this relative world as well, of this and that, of discrimination.

Uchiyama wrote, “In the world of discrimination, there are valuable things, worthless things, new things, shabby things, beautiful things, ugly things, attractive things, disgusting things. When this is the only way we see, eventually there will come a time when our life circumstances on balance seem bleak and dismal. On the other hand, if we handle the most mundane items with care and appreciation, our whole system of valuation is turned on its head.”

I really like that—our whole system of valuation is turned on its head when we just don't stay in these discriminations of “this is valuable, this isn't; this is worthy, this isn't; this is new, this is shabby; this is beautiful, this is ugly.” And we handle with care every part of our cooking.

I came across this term as I was studying called “nyoho practice,” which I didn't know about in all these years. It says nyoho practice is looking for opportunities to act in accord with the Dharma in the midst of our daily lives in very practical, physical ways. We view no act as too mundane or insignificant to perform with care. Now, we always say, before you leave the zendo, straighten your cushion, bring your cushion up to its fullest and put it back, because that has an effect. When you come back in, if you see an all-mashed cushion, like someone just got off, it feels different than when it's in its upright position, centered on the mat, the mat's nice and neat. These things have an effect.

We view no act as too mundane or insignificant to perform with care—closing a door, anything, stepping into a subway. And no object or being we encounter is beneath our respect or attention. No object or being we encounter is beneath our respect or attention.

So just to hold that for a moment as a practice—it's saying nyoho practice is something we practice. And as we do it in that way, our whole valuation would turn on its head.

So Dogen has this teaching, which we're working with this ango—all-inclusive study, encountering everywhere. So whatever we're meeting, we're doing this primarily through art practice, but our lives, cooking our lives, whatever we meet. You know, we hear that a lot—“that's our teacher.” But in a sense, yes, that's what it's saying—that everything we meet can teach us something if we have that kind of openness, as it said, that openness of mind.

So he's inviting us to be alchemists. Yeah, alchemists, shape shifters, transform our lives with all of our ingredients into awakening.

So most important, when we function as the Zen cook of our life, we leave out the attachment to ourself. That's one of the ingredients that Dogen speaks of. When we function as the cook of our life, leave that attachment of self, like anger, like the three poisons. Like, anger is considered a poison. When it's self-centered, self-motivated, it can be a poison.

If we take out our attachment in anger to the self—anger, the same emotion, the same energy—can be the fierce energy, very fierce energy of determination or care. So, you know, I think anger gets a bad rap, like “don't have anger.” It's a very powerful force. It's just a word, but used in the right way where we're not attached to ourself, it could be a very positive force. And it could also mean we care so much.

Take out the self-centered aspect of greed—that becomes a desire to help. We just don't want it for ourselves. And we drop the self-orientation from ignorance, and that becomes a state of the knowing, of unknowing, that allows us new things to arise.

So Dogen wrote this fascicle in 1236, just to give you a context. He finished it in 1237. He was 37 years old. Okay, who's 37 here? This is like his—I don't know how many he's written already since he was—he was born in 1200 and he started writing these fascicles when he was 25 or 26. Can you believe it? It's kind of like Martin Luther King and his writings—started so young. Something was coming through so powerfully.

And it said that he had a reputation for being a strict teacher, so the number of his followers and disciples was rapidly increasing. I found that interesting too—he was known as a strict teacher and things increased, like people came to him for something, some kind of guidelines, or it offered something, his strictness of holding to the Buddha Dharma. It helped people focus and see what was real and true—that's what I imagine.

And of course, just as the Buddha said, you get more people together, you need more protection, more guidelines, more ways of practicing together that everyone understands. This is what we do here. This is how we comport ourselves—regulations, they're called—so we can all practice together with as few difficulties as possible. But we're people, so things will come up within communities and we work with them.

So these are guidelines for the kitchen, and that's how they were born—because things were happening in the kitchen. And so Dogen used to say, “Dharma is food and food is Dharma.” And usually that position in the kitchen was given to a Roshi or a senior monastic. But such is the case—I just arrived and I was the cook. So we just took whoever has a way-seeking mind, which is all of us here, so you could be the cook. Okay. And sometimes you didn't know how to cook—those were... We all had to go through that with someone. Broccoli, broccoli, broccoli, broccoli, broccoli, broccoli, broccoli. Then something else might come in—it's great. It's a great position to nourish the community.

And Dogen, on the back of Uchiyama's book, he said Dogen had three secrets for enlightenment, to generate these attitudes of mind which we can all use today:

A joyful mind—Kishin.
Parental and nurturing mind—Roshin.
Magnanimous mind—Daishin.

So living with a joyful heart, cultivating this joyful mind. A caring with the deep concerns of a parent—a parental mind. And performing all activities with compassion.

I was just thinking of Yukon—he's one of my Dharma brothers who died last year in February. Those that knew him, he was quite funny and always like a trickster in a way, always joking around and getting—he had this way with people. And I used to tell him, I used to say, “Parental mind, Yukon.” When I wanted him to shape up, I'd say, “I want to see your parental mind.” He'd snap to, like, “Oh yes, parental mind. Take care of things. Don't just keep joking around. Take care.” And that was part of it. But do it in such a way that he was taking care, nurturing.

Dogen puts it like this: “The aspects of these attitudes are to see that working for the benefit of others benefits oneself. To understand that through making every effort for the prosperity of the community, one revitalizes their own character.”

So I'll just say a little bit about this joyful spirit mind. Ed Brown—Ed Epsey Brown, who also was from San Francisco Zen Center, started this restaurant, Greens, and Tassajara Cookbook—that's Ed Brown, if you have that one. That was a great cookbook. So he would teach these different mind spirits. He said, “Joyful—consider this carefully: All of the myriad circumstances which brought you to the front door of this temple today to engage zazen, you made this opportunity, you walked onto the path and to encounter this Dharma. As we just chanted, the Dharma is rarely encountered even in millions of ages. What a rare gift that you gave yourself today, that you are encountering the Dharma. It may not seem that way, but hey, all of Brooklyn isn't here today, so it is pretty rare. But you are. And we can be grateful and spirited by this movement of raising the Bodhi mind.”

Every moment we have lived, every choice we have made up until this moment—if one decision was changed, we can't say our path would be the same, could we? One decision might be different. We made all these decisions, every choice up to this point, which you may not have seen as a choice, but that's the way it lined up, brought us to here, this moment.

And one aspect of joyful mind that Daido Roshi always emphasized—or should I say roared, which we heard in the film yesterday—was, “Put your entire being into your activity. Just give it your whole body and mind. Don't hold anything back.” Like a plant, when the sun's shining, they just, like, turn towards it. You don't see a few petals, like, “No, not today.” They just go right to it, right? He says, “With that kind of turning, do what you're doing, what you're doing. Completely.”

We see that's no small thing. I mean, get up and do kinhin—to really just walk, do you see? Like, we go off in our head and we're not just walking, we're thinking about this and that and hamburger and whatever. But to just walk, we have to really be meticulous in our effort, understand why what we're doing. And most of us have had this experience of a joyful mind, direct experience, wholeheartedly engaged in activity. I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it.

And we know other things happen. We have annoyed, angry, not wanting—what is this moment mind? The world becomes narrow, necessarily completely filled as that. Like when we're annoyed, that's it, that's the whole world, right? All our thoughts. Sometimes we forget we're actually aware of that, sometimes we're not. But if we're aware of it, we're aware we're annoyed, we're aware we're angry. That's good. That's good. It's all-inclusive. It's not going to a particular state because all of those aspects of our enlightened nature—annoyance, anger—so there's wisdom there. There's wisdom in all those experiences, or what we call, you know, anger, depression—there's wisdom there. And that, if we can see that, if we can care about that attitude, is what Dogen's saying. Just care about the attitude we're in, meet it with awareness. Then we have the possibility to see what's happening in that state and relax a bit and meet this more directly with our senses—not with our stories, just senses.

And right there, we can find a bit of joyful mind in that awareness. Do you know that? I'm sure maybe you know that. And especially when we could say it to someone who we're with and we're really annoyed or angry, and we could say, “Like right now, I'm really annoyed and angry,” it kind of takes the lid off the pot. We're not going to blow.

Dogen says, “If this is not yet clear to you, it is because your thoughts run around like a wild horse and your feelings jump about like a monkey in the forest.” You might have heard zazen in the beginning called us working with our monkey mind. It's like a monkey that's swinging in the jungle, and we grab a thought and we swing, and we grab another thought and we swing and we swing and we swing—and the less we interrupt, we just keep swinging from, Daido used to say, from cradle to death, we keep swinging on vines.

So when the monkey and the horse step back and reflect upon themselves, freedom from all discrimination is realized naturally. This is the way to turn things while being turned by things.

There was a film made about Ed Brown, I don't know if any of you have seen it, called ""How to Cook Your Life,"" a documentary by Doris Dörrie, who did ""Cherry Blossoms"" and a bunch of other—""Enlightenment Guaranteed,"" yeah, Doris Dörrie. So she did this very raw footage of Ed Brown talking about being a cook. And it's very raw, and Ed's there talking to his students, and he's telling his students that he is a human being. And he says he's like all human beings: “I get irritable, I get fed up and I get frustrated.” And this is not sweetened in the film—she's just, you know, he's saying it to his students.

At one point in the film, he becomes really annoyed with his students because they don't know how much salt is required in a bread recipe, and he just goes ballistic. And he did a retreat at the monastery when I was the cook in 1990, and I witnessed him do that. And yet I felt something different—like, it could be taken to feel like that's really excessive what he's doing right now, and his fed-upness. But I really thought he was demonstrating clearly, knowingly, an important part about how our lives are discovered in details.

Because he knew what he was experiencing. And he just brought it out, this awareness of fed-upness and anger. And he just folded it in. He folded it into the tomato sauce, you know. I used to say to Daido, “I don't think I can cook today—like, I'm having a moment of, like, I'm upset, I'm, you know, disappointed. And I said, I don't think I should cook because people are going to, like, eat and they're going to feel, like, disappointed, and they're going to get my upset.” He said, “No,” he said, “alchemize it, transform it. Like, when you're actually cooking, is that what you feel?” And I said, “No, I'm so excited, like, it feels great. I'm in there cutting the carrot.” He says, “Exactly. Just take all of those ingredients, put it in the pot and it'll change. But when you try and keep something out, that's not going to work.” It's a good teaching.

Dogen points out, we only have the moment-to-moment details to sincerely care for. That's it. All in the details. We've heard that our life is details and that's what we sincerely care for—all of that, all of it, moment to moment.

He says, “Prepare the meals of your life day and night in this way, without wasting time. If there is sincerity in your cooking and associated activities, whatever you do will be an act of nourishing the sacred body.” If there is sincerity in our actions, in our cooking and with our activities, whatever we do will be an act of nourishing the sacred body of all beings, of everything. But then, you know, those poisons—it becomes very self-centered, and what are we seeing? Not everybody's getting this wonderful meal that we have the potential for.

He says this is also the way of ease and joy for the Great Assembly. Uchiyama says it's called life that is lived fully and completely—nothing held back—the supreme meal.

And there's another story of Dogen, you may have heard, where he meets the cook on the boat going to China. So Dogen was going to China to see if he could find authentic Zen training because he wasn't feeling it in Japan. And, by the way, there was a potter on that ship, I learned. So when I was in clay, and the Chinese had developed glazes before the Japanese had developed—they were using mostly raw firing—and on the ship was a potter named Shigematsu, who, in this book I was reading on pottery, spoke about this guy named Dogen he met who was going for Zen teachings, and there was a cook there, and they were all having this conversation. So when I got to the monastery and Daido said, “Master Dogen,” I just went like, “The guy on the boat!” But I didn't follow him then. I went for the other guy. I wanted the secret glazes from China.

But Dogen was so impressed with this cook on the boat that he visited him at his monastery. And when he got there, he was drying mushrooms out in the courtyard, and it said the stones on the courtyard were so hot that they burned one's feet. Ever go out, like, when the patio is so hot, it's just like burning your feet? So that's how hot it was. And this old man, who was 70—I don't like to say that now, like, “really old, 70,” nae nae—but he had a cane, an arched back.

Dogen asked him, “Why don't you have an attendant dry the mushrooms for you?” And the Tenzo answered, “Others are not me.” Dogen asked, “The sun is hot. Why do it now?” And the Tenzo answered, “What time should I wait for? I have taken this position in my old age. This is the fulfillment of many years of practice. How can I delegate the responsibility to others?”

Dogen writes, “I again asked the Tenzo, ‘Honorable Tenzo, why don't you concentrate on zazen practice and on the study of the ancient master's words, rather than troubling yourself by holding the position of Tenzo and just working? Is there anything good about it?’” And the Tenzo did what you just did—laughed aloud and replied, “Good man from a foreign country, you do not understand practice or know the meaning of the words of ancient masters.” Hearing him respond in this way, I suddenly felt ashamed and surprised. So I asked him, “What are words? What is practice?” And the Tenzo said, “If you penetrate this question, how can you fail to become a person of understanding?”

Very Zenny, huh? You ask a question, and you get a question right back—the boomerang. Any good teacher will throw you a boomerang as a student. You throw it out, and it just goes right back. So that's a good way to test a teacher—if the boomerang comes back, “What?”

So Dogen withdrew with a deep appreciation of the Tenzo's practice and the manifestation of Buddha Dharma. “What should I wait for?”

So part of training is knowing what it's time for. As you see, we have a Zen clock, right? We start—boom, boom, boom, boom—9:25 Dencho starts. We say, “Arrive at 9:15. Give yourself some time to settle in.” Jikido lights the candle at a certain time. It's always our practice, no one else's. So we're always learning what it's time for. When do we take the soup off the stove so it doesn't burn? There's a time for things. We have to pay attention to what it's time for, as in our care.

When is it time to speak to someone in an important way? I always look at that with my teacher. I see—when do I talk to Shugen about this? Not now. But I could feel when there's a receptivity happening, and it's the time for it. Otherwise, I might get burned in a certain way. I don't mean in a bad way—he doesn't do that—but it's not the right time. I do it to myself, actually.

So, you know, Daido lived in the parsonage, which was where the Jizo House is—there's another building there now—but he lived right on campus, so he saw everything. It was a little house, tiny little structure, but his living room was all windows around, so he could see from his living room right into our zendo, the monastery zendo. And so one day we had this phone that he would call, and we called it the Bat Phone because he could call us directly. And when we heard that ring, we knew it was Daido calling—we should answer the Bat Phone.

So it was in the morning, I was attendant up front, and the Bat Phone rang. And so I run down, I get it. He said, “The jikido's late.” I said, “What?” He said, “I could see from my living room, they lit the candle late. It's your responsibility to know what it's time for and tell them.” I was like, “Whoa, wow. Why the demand? Who was that for? Who was that for? And then how did I transmit that to the person?” And I looked at my watch and I was like, “Damn, he's right.” And I knew it was a little over, but I was, you know, okay, you know, but it was a little over. And it was repetitive, too. It wasn't the first time. And this time he saw it.

So what is it time for in the kitchen? Of course, you know, Daido and Dogen taught all of life is zazen. So zazen needs to come off our cushion into our life. And zazen is paying attention, right? Staying present. And of course, in the kitchen, knives are sharp, potatoes and mushrooms are very slippery to cut when they get wet, vegetables rot, things can burn—all these details and caring and a timing, and there's joy to be in accord with the Dharma in time, in the midst of our daily lives.

And often, when people go to a retreat at the monastery, the kitchen is one of the places they'll end up, you know, because we get a simple task for caretaking—caretaking, that's the name of it—cutting a vegetable, simple, deceivingly simple. Sometimes just doing these physical tasks, and we get this chance to practice wholeheartedly just on this one thing.

Once I gave someone—I needed all these onions, and I gave them a whole bunch of onions to cut, big bowlful, in fact. And I just watched them, I was so inspired. They did it all, they were bawling and wet and just, you know, and they did it like there was nothing else to worry about, like that was their entire—they totally did it. I was so inspired. And it was like onions, you know, and I could see their joy in doing it, like they weren't bothered by what an onion does. It was remarkable. They were just naturally engaging.

And then this parental mind—this mind of treating all things as being sacred, with respect, affectionate, caring for what we're handling. How deep is a love like that? It's parental mind. Taking up a green vegetable and turning it into a 16-foot golden body. Taking a 16-foot golden body and turning it into a green vegetable. With a nurturing mind, a parental mind, we can make all things, all activities alive and vibrant.

So to really strive to treat things like that in all our affairs, particularly with people, with each other—that parental mind, with good care and deep respect, no matter what the ingredients are before you. Not so easy.

I always love this part. It says, “Take special care lest a mouse accidentally falls into the pot. Under no circumstances allow anyone who happens to be drifting through the kitchen to poke their fingers around or look into the pot.” We know that happens a lot, especially at the monastery—we're always hungry. So we'd always used to—and we had the kitchen, it was a big passageway, and so people would submit, “Ooh, cookies!” And you know, you're the cook and you're like, “All right, take one,” you know, but you got 50 people walking through—there goes your cookies. So it's a good rule, a good regulation.

I don't think Dogen was talking about some cosmic magical power. He's saying, with respect to anything, act in a way where we're seeing with loving eyes, handling things as sacred, and something happens—we feel it. It's not rational. We feel it.

There was a woman that came to a Zen training weekend, and then she sent a little video of her husband vacuuming. She sent him for a gift, and when he went home, he was vacuuming, and he never did it before. So she took this video and she said, “I don't know what you people did, but I love it.” And suddenly, like, just in, like, he started to see, like, with loving eyes, I suppose, and care, like he cared if the place was clean. But she never saw him vacuum. So she goes, “I don't know what you did, but that was him,” right? He just turned it on himself, turned it.

So where do we draw the line of any activity being less than sacred? Like when you're parking your car, do you line it up straight? And do you notice, like, if I leave room, then this guy can get out or someone else can park there? That awareness, that parental mind. Putting your shoes on the shoe rack straight, not, like, on the floor, like all different directions—he says, “Sounds pretty simple.” To let it register. And Uchiyama says, “And see how it feels, handling everything with equal care.” This also includes being prudent and aware what is needed.

Dogen says, “See the pot as your own head and the water as your lifeblood.”

And then this magnanimous mind, he says—big mind, it's sometimes called—he offers this advice to the Tenzo: “Like a mountain, stable and impartial, exemplifying the ocean. It is tolerant and views everything from the broadest perspective. Although drawn by the voices of spring, do not allow your heart to fall. With this attitude, we engage in activities fair-minded, impartial, not swayed by our judgments, good or bad. Your attitude towards things should not be contingent upon their quality. A person who is influenced by the quality of the thing, or who changes their speech or manner according to the appearance or position of the people they meet, is not a person working in the Way.”

So what is this impartiality, this non-discriminating mind? Dogen goes on to say, “Nurturing mind makes things sacred and worthy of respect. Magnanimous mind makes all things equally sacred and valuable. Where the mind is stable and imperturbable. While the mind may whip the waves of the ocean surface, magnanimous mind lets us remain a full, vast body down to the depths.”

And just because magnanimous mind makes things equal, equally sacred and valuable, doesn't mean we ignore the differences—the differences between people, between things. The mind is broad and impartial enough to include and encompass differences rather than pretending they're not there.

That's important. Yes, we have to discriminate stones from lentils—I don't want to eat stones; we've got to know what a stone is, and it's not a lentil. But are we taking stones from lentils or are we taking lentils from stones?

Dogen expresses this when he describes cleaning up the kitchen: “Put those things that naturally go in a high place onto a high place, and those that would be most stable on a low place onto a low place. Clean the chopsticks, ladles and all the other utensils. Handle them with equal care and awareness, putting everything back where it naturally belongs. Keep your mind on your work and do not throw things around carelessly.” But that's so fun sometimes. Don't get too rigid. I mean, you gotta, like, fling things around sometimes—I do. With a little music too, you know. Anyway, I think you get the point. It's not about rigidity, but it's just the respect and the care. And some things want to be flung sometimes. Can we kindly, lovingly make differences part of our life practice?

He says, “Do not arouse disdainful mind when you prepare a broth of wild grasses. Do not arouse joyful mind when you prepare a fine cream soup.” I was just thinking of you. I'll tell you why. “When there is no discrimination, how can there be distaste? Thus, do not be careless when you work with poor materials and sustain your efforts when you have excellent materials. Never change your attitude according to the materials. If you do, it's like you're varying your truth when speaking to different people.”

Our habit tendency is not to use ingredients we might think might ruin the meal. Sometimes those are the best. The thing we think might ruin it might be the best. We want to throw them away, maybe hide them in the back of the refrigerator, on the back shelf, out of sight, behind everything else. But Dogen instructs us, take the ingredients we think are going to ruin our meal and figure out how to use them that they improve it.

So just look at the world situation too—what we think is going to be ruined and is being ruined—and figure out how to use it so it can improve. Apply it to any situation.

I know some of you know I was making a bean soup and Yukon was with me in the kitchen. We were like Mutt and Jeff, you know. But I found—and we were cleaning out the refrigerator, and you know, you build a soup as you're cleaning, and you got a little piece of this and you cut it up—and we came across a half of banana. And I'm talking about a pot of soup. So I said, “Peel it and put it in the soup.” He says, “I'm not putting that in the soup.” I said, “It's a bean soup. Bananas go with beans. Like, put it in the soup.” We got in such a fight over, like, a little piece of banana that even when he was sick and dying, he made a joke and he says, “I can't believe you put that banana in his soup”—till his last breath.

So how about it in regards to a person—times we might seem that we can't find a way to use somebody's particular qualities which may seem toxic and harmful to what we're trying to do. We may make a clear decision not to use their particular ingredients in the meal—we can make that decision, and we don't ignore or deny the ingredient. But we can still make a choice without denying it, acknowledge it, remain aware of it. We may even appreciate it in another context, but we decide at that moment we won't be using it. And then to refrain from saying that about someone's life—“I don't want to be like that, I'll leave it out on the table.” It's still going to be there whether we like it or not, so why deny the flavor?

So cultivating bigness that doesn't judge, like we sit a period of zazen and we might say, “Oh, that was really a good period of zazen.” Then we have another one—“Oh, I couldn't even get to two in that period. It was terrible, useless. I sat this morning, I just saw my mind was busy, busy.” You saw that? Do you see? That's awareness. That's precious. Don't judge the ingredient, just see it for what it is.

Dogen ends his instructions with these words: “If anything should be revered, it is enlightenment. If any time should be honored, it is the time of enlightenment. When you long for enlightenment and follow the way, even taking sand and offering to the Buddha is beneficial. Drawing a figure of Buddha and paying homage also has an effect. How much more so if you act in harmony with the minds and actions of your ancient predecessors, how can you fail to bring forth their virtue and practice? After all, enlightenment's job is compassionate activity. Zazen is compassionate activity.”

How is it then, when we act, when no act is viewed as too mundane or insignificant to meet someone or perform with care, that no object or being we encounter is beneath us in terms of being worth our respect and attention? Because everything matters. Everything's connected.

So let's keep cooking our supreme meal together. Thank you for being here, for listening.

Just get up and slide your zabuton. Yes, I'm talking to you. Yeah. So we can see each other. Yeah, it's fine. You can use that whole area there.

Good morning and thanks for springing forward. We're still doing that, yeah. So today I wanted to... We're in Ango, which is a 90-day training intensive. For those of you that are new, it goes back to the time of the Buddha. It's a time where we really increase our contact with the Dharma. And we're studying the Eight Gates of Zen, which is a training matrix based on the Eightfold Path of the Buddha that my first teacher, Daido Roshi, set up as a way of training students in the Buddhadharma. When he created that, it was fairly new to this country. There weren't many resources—there was no internet, not many books. So he put together this way that we could train. If you're reading it, you might see some things are outdated or different now, so it's just interesting to look at.

One of the gates of training is art practice, and the residents are reading for... We chose for our academic study that we do once a week here to read together ""The Zen of Creativity,"" written by Daido Roshi. So I don't know, this talk is something about the creative spirit—that we are creative beings, that we're constantly creating. It's not just making things like paintings or sculptures, though that's a part of creation and a valuable part and brings immense joy and goodness to us. But what are we creating? What do we stop creating?

We're a part of a vast web of interconnectedness, and we keep hearing this in the training from the Avatamsaka Sutra, the diamond net of Indra—that we're all intimately connected. That's how vast we are. And this web isn't all tangled up. Some people think of like a fishing net, all wound up. No, it's a vast, functioning, pulsating creativity. And so, yeah, we are always creating, always communicating. Part of what practice is about is becoming conscious and aware of what we are doing and what is our intention. What's that emerging from? As a practitioner of peace, as a bodhisattva, we want to practice good, create good.

And we do. See, in one moment—from the moment you woke up till breakfast—we can be in any realm, we can create any realm. We can be in hell in a moment, we can be in heaven, we can be an animal, we can be a hungry spirit. So we're training to bring the whole being into awareness, to recognize our creations.

He starts off: Creativity is our birthright. It's an integral part of being human, as basic as walking, talking and thinking. Throughout our evolution as a species, it has sparked innovations in science, beauty in the arts, and revelation in religion. Every human life contains its seeds and is constantly manifesting it. Whether we're building a sandcastle, preparing Sunday dinner, painting a canvas, walking through the woods, programming a computer, interacting in the subway—the creative process, like a spiritual journey, is intuitive, nonlinear and experiential. It points us towards our essential nature, which is a reflection of the boundless creativity of the universe.

Zen Buddhism, and particularly the Zen arts, are a rich source of teachings to help us understand and help us cultivate our creativity. And as we know, Buddhism traces its history back to Shakyamuni Buddha, who lived over 2,500 years ago in India. The Buddha spoke upon his own enlightenment and saw that each and every being, as well as the great earth itself, is perfect and complete, lacking nothing. He pointed out that our idea of a separate, limited self is a painful delusion. That's that interconnectedness, right? So everything we think, do with our mind, with our body, with our actions—body, speech—has an effect. Sometimes we don't think about that with our thoughts—""No, no, they're in me. That doesn't go anywhere."" Hmm. Wonder.

He says the self is empty of any intrinsic characteristics. So what kind of expression comes out of that realization? All the Buddhist teachings are skillful means to help people discover these truths for themselves.

Then in the 6th century, there was a monk named Bodhidharma. Some of you might see him—he's often depicted kind of growly and grumpy in these paintings of him. He doesn't have eyelashes because it's said to stay awake, he pulled them out and then threw them to the ground and they became the first tea plants. I don't know how true that is—that's in the legend—but he is considered to be the first ancestor in the Chinese lineage of Zen. He came from India to China. So this is 6th century CE. He defined Zen by four points. He said: Zen is a special transmission outside the scriptures. So it's not anything we read or find in books. It doesn't rely on words and letters. It's a direct pointing to the human mind and the realization of enlightenment.

So the Zen arts are a form of that direct pointing. What is this direct experience, direct pointing? D. T. Suzuki said, ""Experiencing reality directly without relying on concepts, beliefs or external interpretations. A state of immediate, unmediated awareness."" Direct. Smells good. That's even extra, right? It's cold. That's extra. Just very direct.

We've all had these unexpected, unsuspected moments of just simple presence where our heart and mind just relax for a moment. There's a gap in our continuous thinking about things and doing things to things, but there's a gap where we relax and there's a simple presence with things. And there's a direct experience that happens a lot in nature—before we say, ""Oh, how beautiful,"" but when we just encounter it, it's like right before anything, before the mind moves—maybe for a moment—and we just dissolve for a moment with a boundless heart and mind. Could even happen with a person, where that seemingly separate, solid, static sense of self turns into kind of a healthy emptiness for a moment. Just a healthy emptiness not filled within ourself.

In this regard, I was thinking about one of the first practice instructions on Zazen I heard from Daido Roshi, where he said, stop attaching—I mean, stop creating as a creative. He said, ""Stop creating by attaching."" It was interesting because this week, Kien, one of the monastics, sent—Daido had this rant that he did during an introduction to Zen training about zazen. It's 23 seconds, and Kien found it and sent it to me. So I'm going to read you Daido's little rant that he did—and some of you might be going, ""Uh-huh, I remember that, it's the same thing every time.""

""The first and most fundamental of the eight gates of training is zazen. And some of you just received instructions in this. Don't confuse zazen with meditation. Don't confuse it with mindfulness or mindlessness or focusing the mind or quieting the mind, or concentration. Zazen is not meditation. Zazen is a way of using your mind, a way of living your life, and it's a way of doing those things with other people. And at the same time, there is no rulebook to go by. You have to go deep into yourself to find the foundations of it.""

Zazen brings us home constantly to the moment—to stop creating and directly experience. But that's the first step of what zazen is about. It does not take place on the cushion. Ultimately, it must manifest in everything that we do. It is our very life itself. And step by step, as our practice deepens and we travel through the stages of training, that zazen evolves into a whole way of living your life and using your mind.

So in Zazen, the goal isn't to stop the thoughts that arise or create a blank mind, but rather to observe—see without judgment or attachment—returning to the present moment with the breath as an anchor and using counting, sometimes breaths, to lead the way so we know where to return and we can just see what's happening. We're not forcing the mind to be empty or still. Thoughts and sensations naturally arise. The focus is on observing thoughts and emotions as they arise and pass, without getting caught up in them or judging. That's the stop creating. Once we attach and keep going with it, we're creating more and more, more.

In the tradition, it's called *papañca*. I love that one—just rolls off your tongue. It means proliferation. We proliferate, we make it go and go, and we create more and more, when it just simply has arisen and we see that and we let it be. Later we can take something up.

And then we embody the body. This mountain posture—so integral to calming the body, to quieting the mind. Because sometimes the body doesn't say anything about us. It's not judgmental. Did you ever hear your body, like, it may do things, but it doesn't talk and say things about us. It's just our body, right? So together, when they start coming together, that can be a big support. Because we realize our mind is going all over, creating all over, but our body is stable. It's okay, it's here, it's in its mountain posture.

So in Zazen, we stop imposing ourself on the world. And this happens with the attachment to our habitual thinking—just going over things again and again, creating again. Stop creating. So I've come to feel this ""stop creating,"" Daido Roshi speaks of, is to leave the mind in its natural state. That's what it does. Brain, if you call it, just in its natural state, don't do anything. When thoughts and sensations arise, just let them arise. And then we just reconnect with our breath. I know that's something there, right? But just find your breath again. Just let it dissolve. And when they fall away, just let it fall away. Try not to manipulate.

At times, we kind of fall through. We fall through these appearances that keep coming. We just fall through it. We fall through ourselves, the usual habitual selves. There's a gap we fall through. We just see it for what it is, how we keep creating.

Buddha invited us to come see beyond this notion of a self. So in the gate of art practice—yeah, we're, this Ango—see, I got all kinds of notes here—yeah, we're working with... Since all things are impermanent, in a constant state of change, as it is, appears as something constantly new and different, moment to moment. So because there's nothing fixed, or there's this great basis of underlying emptiness, things can arise as anything whatsoever. And they have a duration, an amount of time that they'll stay—like this has been around for a while, but it's going. But it seems like it's not—this stand, this floor, this building—everything is changing. And so that can be for a long duration or a very short duration. Sometimes we see impermanence very quickly. Just watch a cloud. It'll just show us impermanence very quickly.

So in our art practice, we're choosing something where we can see its changing nature clearly—like an apple or a leaf or a flower petal or a flower—and that's our teacher. For 90 days, you just stay with that one thing and you make a connection with it and you just express in some medium—painting, drawing, movement, singing—however you want to. And of course, you run into the same things you run into in Zazen. With this one thing, you see everything—you see the whole reality in this one thing, all-inclusive study.

There's an Evelyn Underhill, who's a Christian mystic, speaks of the mystic's way of perceiving. And she says:

""Look for a little time, in a special and undivided manner, at some simple, concrete and external thing. This object of our contemplation may be almost anything we please—a tree, a plant, an apple, a distant hillside, a growing plant, running water, little living things. Look then at this thing you have chosen and willfully yet tranquilly refuse the messages which countless other aspects of the world are sending. And so concentrate your whole attention to this one act of loving sight. And that's the only thing that's sort of in your conscious field. Do not think, but as it were, pour out your personality towards it. Let your soul be in your eyes. Almost at once, this new method of perception will reveal unsuspected qualities in the external world.""

So if you can follow that, you're with your apple, but you don't know its name. So you're just there, with this intimate, with this living thing right before we put things on it, and you just let it teach you. And from the outside, everyone's going to... When she says ""ignore the messages which countless other aspects of the world are sending,"" think about that in our life, all the messages that we're sent, that we think we should be, how we should be. An apple's red, sky is blue—no, Giacometti says it's lavender. Don't think, as it were, but just pour out towards it and see what happens.

I love this. Daido gave us—many of you know this assignment—many years ago, and I worked with a potato for 90 days. Did you ever live close to a potato? One potato for 90 days—you can't... So you have to be surprised what's going to happen. You just have to meet it, keep meeting it, just like the person you live with. You know, we can just get into this habituation, but we forget this is a living... this is a living creation we're in, and we're putting this right now together. And that's how it is with our partners, with anyone we meet. We're always putting it together, we're creating it. So how do we get that freshness, that meeting, that thing anew?

As our teacher, she says, an intensified... I don't want to say what she says here because I don't like that she's telling me what I'm supposed to feel, but anyway—it seems as though the barrier between its life and your own, between subject and object, has melted away. You are merged with it in an act of true communion. And you know the secret of its being deeply and unforgettably. Who are we talking about? We're merged. So whose life, secret life, are we learning about, deeply and unforgettably? Don't go further than the tip of your nose. Yeah.

Elizabeth Bishop said, ""What one seems to want in art, in experiencing it, is the same thing that is necessary for its creation: a self-forgetful, perfectly useless concentration.""

So this interconnectedness, this mutual arising, interdependence... I remembered one time Robert Thurman spoke about this, and the Buddha speaking about this in a very unusual way. And I found it. And it kind of goes along with one of our student's writings, Kay Larson. And so she writes:

""The great chain of interdependence and mutual arising, posited by the Buddha and elaborated in the mystical visions of the Avatamsaka Sutra, which characterize the seamlessness and wholeness of life and art perfectly joined—the art of living perfectly joined, never separate for a millisecond, hierarchies dismantled, their power dispersed, never separate, effortlessly healed action that extends throughout time and space, like the Buddha, as an expression of the mind's inherent freedom,"" she writes, ""the mind ground as the seedbed of creativity, the tree that speaks of truths without endless unboundedness, glimpsed in its absolute aspect.""

So the setting for the Avatamsaka Sutra is mind's dawn, and the Buddha's just awakened, as I said before, from his dark night of meditation—a night made dark by his clinging to his fixed views that he held about himself and the limits of his mind. That's why it's dark. And now, through the power of his meditation, he penetrated the veils of the self one by one by one, until he has passed through the seeming solidity of Siddhartha Gautama. As he lets go of the subjective and contingent aspects of his own being, he enters the realm of boundlessness beyond words—a mystic realization of harmonic unity and identity, just like we chanted this morning. And he looks up in the clear light of his Buddha nature, and he sees the morning star. Boom.

Here is Robert Thurman, how he rephrases the Buddha's post-enlightenment dilemma after he realizes himself. Now, you have to understand, Robert Thurman has a lot of sense of humor as he's teaching Buddhism, so I really appreciate this.

Say you are the Buddha and you're free of suffering and you're totally great, as happy as a clam, as happy as a bee, and at one with the universe. And then you see all these miserable people, yet what would you do? What would it do for you to go give them a big grin and a big hug or smother them with joyfulness? They'll just get freaked out and paranoid and say, ""What does this person want?"" So instead, a Buddha has to develop some strategies, some art, to first of all open the person's imagination to the fact that there is a world where they don't have to be miserable all the time. And then he has to help them with a method of how to move from their paranoid corner of misery into the great ocean of bliss of the universe that you, as a Buddha, perceive.

So the Buddha becomes the world's first performance artist, and he takes on roles intuitively chosen to convey an experience that is more than the sum of words that anyone could say about it. He's got to do something different. He can act freely because he set himself aside. He has pierced through those veils, those illusions—not only of selflessness, but the illusion of that solid, substantial, historically determined ""me,"" concocted from my conditioning, your conditioning. He's seen his essential nature as a mirage of the mind. And he's not entered any unusual or extraordinary or otherworldly state. He has simply let go of his encumbrance. That's what we're practicing—what's in the way. And art practice shows us that. I mean, how many of us have so much around art, you know, and making a mark or a movement, right? We're loaded. So it's a perfect training gate to set ourselves free.

Now the Buddha's free—free to meet others where they stand and adopt whatever tactics are most effective to liberate people. And that's what we try and find with who we're dealing with. As much as we know, we keep trying to find those ways to be liberated. If we feel it, then we can do it for another person.

And here's Thurman again:

""The point is, in terms of art, when we go into the magical aspect of the Buddha, you look at the lifetime of the Buddha and see how every breath that the Buddha draws, every gesture the Buddha makes, every word the Buddha speaks, is an artistic manifestation in the sense that none of it is driven by any sort of selfish impulse on the part of the being that was formerly Siddhartha Gautama. Everything he does is a communication of compassion to other beings, creating doorways to open up their imaginations and then their whole being to enlightenment, to nirvana, to peace, to being at peace. You have to present peace first as a work of art, and that allows people to perceive it, and it opens up the possibility that they can experience for themselves.""

So we treat ourselves as a work of art, and we work on this work of art to find peace, to create peace. And people will perceive it, and that opens the possibility that they can experience it directly for themselves. This is something we can create. This is our art.

As a human being, who would want to seek Nirvana if they couldn't imagine that such a state of freedom, that there is such a state of freedom from suffering?

Kay writes: ""Do I take the cue from the Buddha and regard my life as a work of performance art that conveys intimately and decisively the state of my awareness and the condition of my compassion? Can I act when need be? And if not, what gets in the way?""

The Buddha is an artist because he has penetrated the veils of self, because he has tapped the enormous creative resources of his Buddha nature and thus is free of mental encumbrances. ""No hindrance in the mind, therefore no fear,"" promises the Heart Sutra.

The Buddha at his awakening saw that all beings have the Buddha nature—perfect and complete, lacking nothing. Doesn't mean we don't need a little work. As Suzuki says: ""Perfect and complete, lacking nothing. And we all could use a little work."" Thus we are all artists expressing our true nature fully, through the ongoing, minute-by-minute activity of composing our lives out of the flux, out of the floating world. Some of us may realize it and some of us may not, and some of us may create art consciously while others do not. But realization or lack of it doesn't change reality one bit. There's an artist in each of us, and that's Buddhism's great contribution about human creativity.

We are deeply connected and affected by others creating. I listened to Shugen Roshi's talk on Ango opening and he said—I like this comment—he says, ""Don't put the handle of creation in someone else's hands. Create the cause and conditions that give rise to good karmic roots. This we can do. We can give rise to creating the good causes that create good karmic roots."" And part of Sangha's work is to create that together. And then you take that to your many others—your family, your work, your ride on the subway. We're constantly making art. It's beautiful.

Thank you. Thank you for listening.

How auspicious, the beginning of spring.  
How auspicious, the one house of the ancestral teachings and lineage.  
How auspicious, the Buddha Dharma prevailing widely.  
How auspicious, the temple gate prospers.  
How auspicious, when many disciples assemble to meet themselves and to encounter the moment the world comes and honors our way.  
How auspicious, how auspicious, how auspicious, the beginning of spring.  
How auspicious, how auspicious, the founding of this temple, Karinji Fire Lotus.  
How auspicious.  
I changed that last part. He wasn't predicting we were going to be here. Maybe so.

Welcome to everyone. I wish I could talk to all of you and see what brought you here today, but obviously it's the Dharma on some level. And welcome. This is the beginning of what we call Ango, a 90-day intensive training period. This goes way back to the time of the Buddha, when there were the monsoon seasons and the rains would bring the level of water up. The monastics used to travel—it was primarily a monastic community—and they used to travel from sangha to sangha to learn new things, work with different teachers. So this is part of an ancient history, over 2,500 years ago.

It was a great time to work with the Buddha, because the Buddha and all the disciples would be in one place. That was rare, because nobody could travel anywhere. So we recreate, re-enact, if you will, these Ango training periods in the spring and the fall.

We've gone through this winter, and there's always—I don't know, there's something about this spring one. It's always like coming out of the dark days of winter and just in tune with the earth and what it's doing: this revitalization, this sprouting, this growing, this budding, this greening coming. You can see the small shoots pushing their way through.

When they would gather, they would set up like a university. They would have tents and temporary housing and all stay in one place. The emphasis was on collective practice. I still think that's true, that our Angos are about collective practice.

You know, I was reading this thing about how do you clean potatoes? I love potatoes. I have a real affinity for potatoes. The best way to clean potatoes is to put them in a pot of water and just let the dirt fall off. But you put them all together so they bump around and hit each other, and that's how the dirt falls off. I thought that's kind of like sangha: we all get in a pot, all of us, these potatoes, and just bump around, and that's how we get kind of clean. It just falls off. Just begins to fall off.

When we want to generate these virtues of ours—our ability to be patient, generous, loving and kind, and have a joyful effort in practice—we also have to know the other side. We have to see where we're not generous, where we're unkind, where we're impatient. That's how we learn patience. And what a better way to be in this pot. That's where we really can find out new things.

Maezumi Roshi used to call it a rock tumbler. But I like the potatoes better. If you've ever had a rock tumbler, they all bump together and smooth out their hard edges.

So it was a great time to really develop mindfulness, alertness, concentration, embodiment—all towards being of benefit. To bring more goodwill and a loving heart into the world. That's what the practice was about: to end suffering. End suffering in ourselves and in others. These are all nice words, but the day-to-day doing that and remembering how we act with our speech and our body and our thought, that's the work of each one of us and our intentions and how we might want to live.

I sent out a newsletter, if you got it, with a quote from Thich Nhat Hanh that I really appreciated. He says, ""When we say, 'I take refuge in the sangha'—that's community—it's not a statement, it's a practice."" I really appreciated that. It's not a statement, it's a practice.

Refuge—the word in Japanese is ""ki-e""—to unreservedly throw yourself into something. Almost like when a child is on the stairs and you say, ""Jump! Jump!"" and there's just that trust—they just go into your arms. It's that kind of ""ki-e"": unreservedly throwing yourself into the Sangha treasure, the Buddha treasure, the Dharma treasure.

Buddha was constantly offering specific teachings and ways of training and practicing so we could be revitalizing, actualizing who we are, and really making contact with our innate wisdom and compassion. That is who we are. And to keep the pointing towards the wisdom and the compassion.

He would say, ""More Dharma is more Dharma."" And that's what we say: having more Dharma in your life is more Dharma. Yesterday I said, it's really delicious, the Dharma, but nobody can taste it for you. We each have to engage it on our own. He said, it is the antidote for confusion, overwhelm, anxiety, not creating more harm—this practicing.

The point of this season was to intensify practice. It's not like there's always practice going on, but this is to intensify. I always clarify, because people, when I say ""intensify,"" I feel everyone gets all tense, like, ""Wow, I'm already so much,"" and there's an element of panic. That's not intensifying. It's to deepen. It's to focus our concentration, our contact with the Dharma.

One of the reasons why we need to get the mind into concentration is so our sensitivity to what causes suffering can be seen more clearly, can be made bright. This is needed now and always.

If we're going to practice, step on the path for each of us to know, just have a sense, like, why do this? Why sit down on a cushion for 25 minutes or 30 minutes here in your home and just look, be still? Why? When you get just a sense of that—and it doesn't have to be a sentence or something linear or an idea, but just a feeling for that, why that might be helpful and actually see and experience why—it'll keep strengthening your practice and your wanting to encounter the Dharma, the teachings.

So it is to deepen and also to look at what you're already doing. Where are these places to deepen? Sometimes it's just—I've heard people say, ""I'm not very nice. I'm not a kind person. I want to be kinder."" And it's just taking that up, looking for those places that we can. That's deepening, that we can just make a little shift, which ripples like crazy when it's for good. That kind of goodwill, it has a tremendous effect, tremendous reverberation. We don't always see it, but we will feel it. And you'll see it felt by others. If that's what you're working towards, it'll be verified by the universe.

So it could be coming in to sit here during the week. Maybe you are close by, or you can get here and you come one morning or evening a month or a week or each day, and you just commit for 90 days. So you were each looking for—and even if you just walked in today and you had beginning instruction, that's enough. Maybe you're just going to try this at home. Set yourself up at home and sit down. That's the intensifying, that's turning towards the Dharma that's so needed.

Find what qualities we each personally need to be developing, and then that comes into the pot. What qualities do we need to abandon? What can we let go of? What is not serving? What habits do we have that we feel like, ""Oh, that keeps taking me the other way, a direction I don't want to go in, that's painful."" Maybe we can just intensify, learning how to release and go in a different direction.

This is part of what Buddha called the customs of the noble ones: to know what to develop and what to abandon. He calls it the customs of the noble ones, which is each of us. He says that we learn how to delight in abandoning whatever we have to abandon and to delight in developing whatever needs to be developed. Delightful, either way.

When the Buddha was teaching his son Rahula, he said, ""Look at your actions before you act. Look at your intentions. If you think that what you're going to do or say or think is harmful, you've got to tell yourself, 'No, don't do that.' If you don't foresee any harm, then you can do it. If while you're doing it you see that some harm is happening that you didn't anticipate, you stop. Otherwise, you keep doing it. Then when you're done, you reflect on the long-term consequences of your actions. If you see that there was any unforeseen harm, then you resolve not to repeat that mistake again. If you don't see that there was any harm, then you can take joy in the fact that you're training your mind well and you haven't harmed anybody at all.""

So this is very careful, tender, pointed work that we're doing with ourselves when we take this path of turning around, turning the light backwards. Of course, it's not easy to take a good look at our actions. When we actually can and take responsibility, we feel that delight. Even though it may hurt and it's hard to see, there's a measure of joy. It's like, ""Oh, there it is. There it is. I can do something with that."" It's a great relief. And we learn how to trust ourselves. It's not our fault, but we're responsible.

Remember, as you'll go along in the Buddhist teachings, that at the basis is emptiness. There's no fixed condition. Nothing is fixed. It's in a constant state of movement. We're in a constant state of change. I think we can see that all the time, how fast we can be in one state and it changes—luckily. Otherwise, why practice? If we're fixed, there's nothing to practice, we're stamped, we're fixed—but we're not. We're not fixed.

So we bring everything that troubles us, holds us back, obscures us, to the path—our pain, our lack of confidence, our, you know, when we do hurt someone, we take responsibility. We bring that to our path and we open it up. It's not to define us. It's how we learn and grow. What a teaching.

I remember going off the path and creating some harm. I wasn't really very conscious. I thought I was, but I did make some mistakes. It took me a while to make sure I could trust myself first before I could open up further. I really had to get that trust back that I wasn't going to repeat, in the way I had, what I'd done. And that I can trust myself more and also draw back blame, because blame never works. You can't blame anyone. It changes. If we really begin to bring it to our path and understand the teachings and karma, then there's a possibility we really gain some wisdom through it. That's the important part.

I didn't kill anyone—just to clarify—it wasn't that egregious, you know, but it was just one of those things we do to each other.

Each Ango, we have a theme, and for this spring, it's mountain training—it's the Eight Gates of Zen. This is my original teacher's recasting of the Eightfold Path of the Buddha: right view, right understanding, right livelihood, right speech, and so on. He created these eight gates, which are:

- Zazen  
- The teacher-student relationship  
- Liturgy  
- Moral and ethical teachings  
- Creative expression and the body, the miracle of aliveness in the body  
- Dharma study, Buddhist studies  
- Work, our right action in the world  

He said, their gates are where we enter. But he said, there are no gates. There's just this life. But we create these gates so we can enter and experience the richness of our life through a particular focus. As we go further into them, hopefully we'll see how they're all interrelated. Buddhist studies is body practice. The highest art practice is our moral and ethical life. That's an art of how to live well. That's the greatest art practice—that it's an art to work with our body, that right action is zazen—all of them interpenetrating.

We'll have what we call a chief disciple, who's a student that has reached a certain level of training. This year it'll be a monastic named Dayo. He's up at the monastery, and you might see him here during Ango. He's been here before, but he's kind of like the lead person, setting example to the sangha in the most humble way they can. It's said the shuso, when it's a monastic, is supposed to be the one that cleans the toilets at night and nobody knows about it. So we'll see if that's what he takes up. But it's kind of like this secret practice, like you don't see what they're doing. They're doing things, but they don't make a big fuss about it.

Then at the end of the Ango, he'll do his first talk and challenge the sangha in what we call Dharma encounter: take up a koan from the tradition, and everyone gets to ask him questions about his understanding. It's called the hot seat.

So there'll be lots of offerings, plentitude of offerings here and at the monastery. You can weave in and out of here. Please, this is your place. You know, this is only here for us. Right? Some residents are here that I'm very grateful for, that are living their own work life and serving the sangha by keeping this place going. Many sangha members and students come. But it only exists for us to practice the Dharma. So it's yours. I hope you can come as much as you can. Like today—it's great if this was always this full.

We have a regular zazen schedule through the week, which you can come to now that you've had beginning instruction. We'll have an introduction to the Buddhist precepts in March, which I'll be doing. What are the moral and ethical teachings of a tradition that doesn't have, say, a God or something external that we look towards? How do we know what's right and wrong? How do we guide our lives? What are the precepts?

We're doing renewal of vows ceremonies, whether you've taken vows or not. It's called Fusatsu. A lot of liturgy—one of the most liturgical ceremonies in our tradition, quite beautiful—where we acknowledge our harmful karma and our good karma that was ever created by me since of old on account of our beginningless greed, anger, and delusion. We can learn how to be at one with it, which means that response-ability to what we create with our body, mouth, and thought. It's not like it goes away, but we can at least get closer and intimate with it and say the yes—like, ""Yes, this has happened,"" whether we've done it or it's happened to us. It's an acknowledgment. Yes. And we can be at one—atonement—with it.

Those will be happening. I'll be showing two films that we created. One is called ""Watching the Rock Grow."" Have you ever seen that? Watching a rock grow? If you stare at it long enough, you'll see it happen! But this is a film about Daido Roshi and how he formed the monastery in the early years. It's going to be kind of interesting to watch that again with you. You can see, like, this has been so many people and thousands and ancestors. This is our 45th anniversary as a monastery, 25 as a temple here on State Street. Just all the hands and eyes—you—that have contributed to making this place a place of practice. So I thought we'd watch that together and then have a discussion. It's on a Saturday from 2 to 4. A couple of us thought, that's a good time, like it doesn't take up your whole day, you're not eating dinner yet—come watch a film.

The other one will be the Mountains and Rivers Sutra, which combines visual images, natural sounds, music, and Daido merging his artistic expression with a spiritual expression with the Dharma. So it's an opera, so it's sung—the Mountains and Rivers Sutra. This was all based on people that came to the monastery. Someone was an opera singer, someone was a writer of operas, and so they created this opera of the Mountains and Rivers Sutra with Daido's visual things. We'll talk about art practice—whatever you would like to—about this aspect of artistic and spiritual expression coming together.

I will do face-to-face teaching for students and those of you that are formal participants, whether or not you are a student, and whoever else I can see so we can meet. It's a meeting in private on your practice and that includes, of course, your life, but it's brought into the Dharma. As you're sitting and things are coming up or getting clearer, we can check in with one another. Sometimes we don't know, we feel so alone. Sangha helps with that, to be able to see some of the potholes and some of the ways that we move forward. That'll be offered.

We'll be doing a Born as the Earth, Touching the Earth retreat led by some of our Jukai folks. Dogen said, ""These mountains and rivers, these buildings, these sidewalks, belong to those who love them."" He didn't say about the sidewalks and the buildings, he just said, ""These mountains and rivers,"" which means phenomena, ""belongs to those who love them."" If we love something, we'll take care of it, he hoped.

So Daido would take us on these wilderness retreats so we can get close to the earth. We like to maintain that in this city, that it's not that there isn't a wildlife here. This trip will be called River to River, meeting the waterways that surround us as New York City dwellers. Actually, our water here comes from the reservoir right by the monastery, right down the pipeline. We'll do work together and body practice sessions, really trying to see how we live one undivided life through these areas, these aspects of ourselves, how that comes together as one undivided life.

The Buddha knew that practicing more intensely gives us greater opportunities. You feel it right away. I'd also like to talk more about liturgy, especially now in the world, and how liturgy can be so helpful with grounding, with overwhelm, with just giving voice to what's coursing through us and opening up to something larger, to the larger wisdom aspect. It's helpful.

Buddha said, more opportunities to recognize the Buddha mind that is steady and continuous, regardless of fluctuations, regardless of conditions, because we don't know, we can't control those, but we can work with ourselves. That's always been so hard. But sometimes it's when those conditions are that way, we find something true in our integrity and we deepen there.

He said, ""Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work, but to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in our heart—calm, seeing, contemplating, having responding-ability."" We're encouraged not to get lost in the congestion of mind, remembering that we have a path. It's called Marga, having a path. We want to keep exposing the unshakability of the awakened mind. We need each other, and we need to practice that because we forget. I forget. We have to forget. We have to remember, keep remembering what we have, who we are.

It says if we look after and care for our mind really well, then we're not the only one who benefits. The act of generosity and kindness is both to ourself and to others.

The Buddha uses the image of this story he gives of two acrobats. You might know this. There's one acrobat who's the teacher, and then there's an assistant who is a young girl. The teacher says to the assistant, ""Okay, if you get up on my shoulders, because they're acrobats, and we'll get on top of that bamboo pole, we should look after each other so that we can both come down safely."" And she says, ""No, no, no, I disagree. That's not going to work at all. Each person should look after themself so that we can each be safe and come down safely.""

It's kind of interesting, right? At first you're like, Oh, that sounds really selfish, you know? And I always thought that on the airplane too—you know, put your own mask on first and then go help people—because we're not... Obviously that's kind of not nice, you know, put it on them. But it's like, we can't be useful if that's going to help us help more. Then we balance ourselves first because we can't balance another person, can we? So we can't look after other people's balance. We have to look after our balance so that we don't knock somebody else off balance, is what he was teaching.

He says, ""When we're helping ourselves, we are helping others."" Buddha said, ""Looking after oneself, one looks after others. Looking after others, one looks after oneself."" Yeah. Takes courage. I have to summon courage.

I was at Ayo Yetunde's retreat the week on microaggressions, on just basically being aggressive and how we've handled that in our lives and on this planet, in this particular country. She speaks about Indra's Net, this realization of how we are all interpenetrated and interconnected. Whatever we think, that our actions don't matter, but it does—it affects everyone everywhere. You know, they say when a butterfly flaps its wings in France, we feel the breeze here. I think this is bearing out all over.

I wanted to read this inescapable mutual mutuality that's ever present. It's from Resmaa Menakem. He wrote ""My Grandmother's Hands,"" ""Quaking America,"" and ""Monsters in Love."" And so she writes—Ayo articulates it so beautifully:

""We are conceived into the net, born into it, and exist within it. We will die in its entanglements. In the meantime, can we enhance the ways we live in this vast and abundant community of kin, near and far? Casting Indra's Nets calls us to live out of and into the best parts of who we are, because we are all kin. She urges us to return to our basic goodness and choose mutuality over brutality, time after time, moment after moment, breath upon breath. If you're ready to be part of this transmutation, please turn to practice.""

So that's what we have in store for us, this Ango. I wanted to give us time to enter together. There's a formal entry, but I'm calling forth here just an entry into walking the path of peace, not creating harm, practicing good, and actualizing good for others that we can all do together. Not any kind of formal entry, just by your own yes. You can be able to offer incense today and also sign the scroll. We'll have a few more posted.

I also wanted to bring in briefly just something Martin Luther King said about this net of mutuality, lest we forget. Let's bring him in:

""And don't forget, in doing something for others, that you have what you have because of others. Don't forget this. We are tied together in life and in the world. And you may think you got all you got by yourself, but you know, before you got out here to this temple this morning—you are dependent on more than half the world. You got up in the morning and you go to the bathroom. You reach over for a bar of soap, and that's handed to you by a Frenchman. You reach over for a sponge, and that's given to you by a Turkish person. You reach over for a towel, and that comes to your hands from the hands of a Pacific Islander. And then you go to the kitchen to get your breakfast. You reach over to get a little coffee, and that's poured in your cup by a South American. Maybe you decide that you want a little tea this morning, only to discover that that's poured in your cup by someone who's Chinese. Or maybe you want a little cocoa and that's poured to you by a West African. Then you want a little bread and you reach over to get it and that's given to your hands by an English-speaking farmer, not to mention the baker. Before you get through eating breakfast in the morning, you're dependent on more than half the world. That's the way he says God structured it. So let us be concerned about others because we are dependent on others.""

So much wisdom that we can draw from. Let's point ourselves towards getting wisdom.

To close, we'll do this ceremony and we're going to be chanting what's called the Jizo Shingon Dharani. Jizo Bodhisattva is one of the principal bodhisattvas from the tradition—actually, I think you're all Jizo Bodhisattvas. Jizo Bodhisattva is... so they're not external, like they're us, they're qualities that we possess as a protector of those who are traveling, of women, children, all beings. They tend to go into hell realms and help people. So when your friend is in hell and you just are right there with them in presence, that's Jizo, Jizo Bodhisattva. Just these acts of guiding people and stepping in when you need to.

So this is a Dharani, a short calling up of those qualities. It's a repetition: ""Um ka ka Kabisa ma e soaka, um ka ka Kabisa ma e soaka..."" We'll just go.

I looked at the number of people today and I thought, oh my gosh, if we're all making incense offerings, this is going to be a long service! So I thought students, formal students on behalf of the sangha can make this offering right now. Then we'll leave these haku boxes out and anyone else can make an offering as the service ends and before we go up for refreshments or at any time before you leave. What it is, is there's powdered incense and you just unite with it and you put a little on. The burning charcoal's on the left—so don't pick up the charcoal, that's not the incense. It's pretty clear. I'm saying that because some people have picked up the charcoal—I have!

So pick up the powdered incense and you make an offering there. You hold in mind your intensification, your dedication, your intention. It may not be formed, but just feel it, that'll carry it through.

So we'll get up, we'll hear a drum, and then we'll start the chanting and we'll go from there. Afterwards we'll have a chance to meet upstairs informally. Everyone can come up and have some refreshments, and there are some students you'll see. So feel welcome, if you're new, to meet people and talk to people about what's happening a little further.

Yeah, I'm just really glad you're here and that you came, and that we can form a community like this and support one another and know that this is here for you.

Thank you. Thank you for listening.

37827,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-03-01 12:59","31R","","Zen Center of New York City","Thunderous Silence","","Hello.

When I was at the monastery recently, I started to read Hakuin's book, by Norman Waddell, called Wild Ivy. And Hakuin actually wrote a lot about himself and his practice, to just articulate his process. I've been reading it because, as some of you know, I've been integrating art into teishos, into talks. It's something that Hakuin did, and it's part of the Ebaku line of Rinzai Zen, where they had an art expression within the lineage—shakuhachi and there were many painter priests.

So I thought, let me read about Hakuin and see if I can find anything about his lectures and when he pulled out the brush. I haven't found anything yet, but I did find that he painted a lot, and he wasn't a trained painter either. He had such a wide variety of expression. He could be very kind of realistic, and just be very bold with just splatter, you know, just from the hara, the belly, you know, whatever teaching was needed. He worked a lot with the laity and the illiterate, you know.

So I wanted to reread his Song of Zazen that we chanted, so you can just hear this again. He calls it a song of Zazen, which is kind of nice.

All beings by nature are Buddha
As ice by water, by nature is water
Apart from water, there is no ice
Apart from beings, no Buddha.
How sad that people ignore the nearest and search for truth afar.
Like someone in the midst of water, crying out in thirst.
Like a child of a wealthy home wandering among the poor,
Lost on dark paths of ignorance, we wander through the six worlds.
From dark path to dark path we wander.
When shall we be freed from birth and death?
For this, the zazen of the Mahayana deserves the highest praise,
Offerings, precepts, paramitas, nembutsu, atonement, practice,
The many virtues all rise within Zazen.
Those who try even once, wipe away immeasurable crimes.
Where are all the dark paths then? The pure land itself is near.
Those who hear this truth even once and listen with a grateful heart,
Treasuring it, revering it, gain blessings without end.
Much more if you turn yourself about and confirm your own self-nature.
That self-nature is no nature.
You are far beyond mere argument.
The oneness of cause and effect is clear, not two, not three.
The path is put right with form that is no form.
Going and coming, never astray.
With thought that is no thought.
Singing and dancing are the voice of the law,
Boundless and free in the sky of Samadhi,
Bright, the full moon of wisdom.
Truly, is anything missing now?
Nirvana's here before your eyes. That’s peace.
This very land is the Lotus Land, this very body the Buddha.

That was Robert Aitken’s translation. Hakuin lived from 1685 to 1768—a very dynamic teacher. He was credited with single-handedly revitalizing the Japanese Zen Rinzai School after 300 years of decline. He was so fired up, this guy! And from a very young age, he had a lot of loss.

He heard somebody—I don’t know if it was a teacher, I can’t remember who—but somebody gave this fire-and-brimstone, threatening talk about, like, “If you do something wrong, you’re going to end up in these hell realms.” He couldn’t sleep for weeks as a young kid, and he would ask his mother, like, “Am I going to…? Where am I going to end up?” It bothered him so much. And then she passed away, and he was kind of on his own. So he went into a monastery very young.

He placed special emphasis on brush teachings and koan practice, and he even invented a lot of new koans himself. Some of them we know, and we even see them on tea bags—like, “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” That’s Hakuin’s. And that’s in our koan system. The teacher will say, “Show me, don’t tell me.” And then there’s a whole series of Hakuin questions about this one hand clapping.

So as I said, he was very invested in spreading the teachings to laity and the illiterate. He wasn’t shy about people having kensho—people should have a direct experience of their nature, in a thorough and illustrative way. He wrote:

Never ask your teachers to explain. But when your activity of mind is exhausted and your capacity for feeling comes to a dead end, if something should take place not unlike the cat springing up upon the mouse or the mother hen hatching her eggs, then a great flash of livingness surges up. This is the moment when the phoenix escapes from the golden net and when the crane breaks the bars of its cage.

And he’ll paint this, too. If you can’t understand it by words, he’ll illustrate it for you.

When a person faces the great doubt before them, there is in all directions only a vast empty land without birth and without death, like a large plain of ice extending 10,000 miles, as though seated within a vase of lapis lazuli, surrounded by absolute purity. Within their heart there is nothing, there is not the slightest thought or emotion. It is just as though they were standing in complete emptiness. At this time, when they advance single-mindedly without retrogression, suddenly it will be as though a sheet of ice was broken or a jade tower had fallen. They will experience a great joy, one that never in many years has one seen or heard.

So this is his teaching poem, this Song of Zazen, meditation. It encapsulates the merits of Zazen, and he encourages students to focus on the immediate presence—right here, right now, the immediate presence, just this very moment. He speaks of the many virtues and practices within the Zen tradition and says Zazen contains them all. A form that is no form, as he speaks of in the poem—a form that is no form, where singing and dancing are the voice of the law.

Anyway, this somehow led me to thinking about silence and noble silence. Noble silence is *mouna*—M-O-U-N-A—the Buddha spoke of, which is measurement, which is about measurement and our willingness. He says measurement—Buddha pointed to the measurement of words when practiced leads to more meaningful and powerful speech. So when we’re in silence, in that measuring of words, when we do speak out of this silence, the words are much more powerful.

So what is our willingness to encounter silence? I was just like, what is silence? You know, sometimes it’s got so many different faces because, you know, Audre Lorde on one hand will say, “Your silence will not protect you.” So that’s speaking to a certain kind of silence, where we just don’t say things when maybe we should, and it’s protective. And then Rumi will say, “Let that silence take you to the core of your life.” And Hakuin speaks of this thunderous silence. And I don’t know, it just was something to contemplate.

It’s come up a lot because I have to speak a lot. And I choose sometimes to just remain silent. And so I’m like, what is the silence? What is the silence? When is silence not being silent, actually? And it’s hardly touchable.

In the practice, we could say silence might correspond to having a right view. Seeing impermanence is silence—is seeing the silence of things, that thunderous silence that it’s impermanent, that everything is appearing and disappearing and changing from moment to moment, that kind of silence.

Shunryu Suzuki talks about presence as that which carries us through the difficulty of ups and downs. When you suffer, you should suffer. When you feel good, you should feel good. It’s the willingness to engage with any set of circumstances, to directly encounter the most difficult aspects of our own selves, that gives us the true joy that is part of the meditative practice.

I was thinking about that and how when we enter that silence, that true feeling of feeling, engaging with feeling good or just suffering purely, there’s a measure of joy there, because we’re actually doing that so fully. If you’ve ever felt that, it’s a right view, it’s right understanding. We’re in alignment. Without calling it something, we taste it differently. We taste it differently—appearing and disappearing, changing from known. I could know for myself this feeling, and it was joy that emerged, a kind of joy.

Does it sound like I contradict myself, then? I contradict myself, as Whitman would say. But impermanence is not something we see objectively. It’s something that we taste directly. Impermanence makes me silent—makes me silent, because impermanence is very quiet. But we’re silent, but at the same time we’re many words, many explanations, many representations, many dynamic actions, physical, mental—all this is present. And silence seems to be something very deep, yet very active.

In Japanese, the word for silent is mokurai—mokurai. And moku means silence, and rai means thunder. That’s the word for silence. So silence is quiet, but there’s an enormous voice there, like a thunder. In practice, in zazen, I think we’re sitting into the quiet and hearing that thunder of that silence.

I remember, I told you—many of you know, I was an apprentice to Toshiko Takaezu, my clay teacher. And part of my apprenticeship was a whole life there, you know, was making food and guests, and it wasn’t just clay—working in the garden. We planted tomatoes, and I picked one that was kind of turning red—wasn’t quite red and ripe. And I put it on the windowsill, and we were having breakfast, and I was really excited about this tomato. It was like the first one, and I saw her see it, and thunderous silence.

And I could feel that roar like you would not believe. She was at the sink, and I put it on the windowsill, and she washed her hands and filled the tea kettle. She didn’t say a word to me yet, nothing. And we went about our breakfast. I could hardly chew, and I could hardly swallow. She had this, if you knew her, she had a very straight face, stern at that moment, and she wouldn’t look at me. I was just fidgeting at the breakfast table on my high seat on our bench stool, and we started eating. And she shouted out, “No, you shouldn’t have picked that tomato!”

I was like, finally, yeah. And she went through a whole list of my attributes at that moment—impatience, impetuousness. She just like—this must have been like, on her, like, book—just all these ways that I, in a really loving way, too, I must say. Like, she named them, but she was also not hating me. She was really holding me really beautifully. That was the end of my breakfast.

And then there’s a story of Shakyamuni Buddha where he remained silent to his student, Malunkyaputta. So Malunkyaputta asked the Buddha these questions—whether the Buddha would exist forever, whether the world is eternal, and whether the world is structured by spiritual or by material forces. And the Buddha remained silent. And so this is something people work with—what was this Buddha’s silence, thunderous silence, in response to Malunkyaputta’s metaphysical questions?

And part of that we can understand with this parable of the arrow, where the Buddha was sitting in a park, and this disciple, Malunkyaputta, comes and, recently retired from the world, was concerned with so many things that remained unexplained by the Buddha. And these questions—was the world eternal or not eternal? Was the soul different from the body? Did the enlightened exist after death or not? He thought, if the Buddha doesn’t explain these things to me, I’ll give up training and I’ll return to the worldly life. Have we done that with our teacher? “You don’t explain it to me, I’m out of here.”

So the Buddha replied, “Now, did I ever say to you that if you led a religious life you would understand these things? It is as if a person had been wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison. And their friends, companions, and relatives were to get a surgeon to heal them, and they were to say, ‘I will not have this arrow pulled out until I know who wounded me. Of what caste are they? What is their name? Are they tall? Are they short? Are they medium in height? What color is their skin? Where did they come from? What kind of bow was I wounded with? What is it made of? Was the arrow’s feather from a vulture wing, a heron’s, or a hawk’s?’ Surely this person would die before they knew all this.”

The Buddha says, “Whether the view is held that the world is eternal or not, Malunkyaputta, there is still rebirth, old age, death, grief, suffering, sorrow, and despair, and these can be destroyed in this life. I have not explained these other things because they are not useful. They are not conducive to tranquility and Nirvana. What I’ve explained is suffering, the cause of suffering, the destruction of suffering, and the path that leads to the destruction of suffering. This is useful, leading to non-attachment, the absence of passion, perfect knowledge.” Thus the Buddha spoke, and with joy, Malunkyaputta applauded his words.

Buddha keeps pointing us towards wisdom. When we’re suffering, what kind of questions are we asking, and are they relieving us of our suffering? Where are they leading? What are the questions that are helpful?

So Katagiri Roshi, in Returning to Silence, speaks about some of these characteristics of the Buddha’s silence. He says the first characteristic is emptiness. That’s right. Everything is produced by dependent co-origination, which means there’s nothing to hold on to because everything’s interconnected very closely, appearing and disappearing at super speed. So we’re in motion, everything is. There’s nothing but activity. This dynamic, incredible dynamic functioning that we see moment to moment is called emptiness.

Remember, emptiness is exactly form, form is exactly emptiness. It’s dynamic, moving constantly. That’s the first characteristic of Buddha’s silence. So when we chant the Mahaprajna Paramita Sutra—no eye, ear, nose, tongue, no body, no mind—these words “no” and “not” show us nothing has a separate existence; everything’s interconnected, sewn together with a little jewel at each intersection. The koan Mu is “no,” “not,” pointing us in this direction.

The second characteristic of Buddha’s silence is oneness. He said oneness is realizing the wholeness of existence, instead of being content with knowing one small aspect, and is characterized by reflecting upon the self with an open heart that accepts and respects others. So we have another parable of that elephant—Ayo Yetunde spoke of this in our retreat on microaggressions—where there’s an elephant and we’re kind of blind with ignorance. You grab a part, and maybe it’s the tusk, and you say, “Ah, it’s really hard.” Another person feels the tail and it’s like, “Oh, it’s skinny and taut.” So each person has a part, but for wisdom we need to come out from the parts and see a larger web and not just be on these smaller… the wholeness of the existence, not just knowing one small aspect.

He says, to understand, we have our own opinion and then to see our opinion in relation to other people’s opinions. When we see our opinion and others’ opinions are as one whole, it’s pretty hard to fight each other. Wow. Wow. Especially in light of some conversations I’ve heard lately. It’s pretty hard to fight each other. It’s all connected.

So we are quiet. It makes us quiet when we taste the pain and the suffering very deeply. Don’t you find it hard to say anything? We know who we are in that silence together. And this is related to our past, and to our future, and to the present. Right here, now. When we really understand this—not two—we taste silence and we see silence. He says when, where, how depends on our practice. We need to practice being quiet. He says, “I don’t mean shut up, but to feel the great space where you can accept all that’s here. It’s all here. All the characteristics are here. And we’re not apart from any of them.” And yet that dynamic is empty. It’s in movement. It’s not fixed.

The third one he says—Buddha’s silence—he describes as devotion. Silence is full of devotion. Self-centered life is thrown away to wholeness. A whole life is characterized by commitment and love, wisdom and prayer. And prayer in this sense is not something directed from a particular subject to a particular object with the expectation of a result—like you pray for something and then you’re hoping that it’s going to result in something. It’s more open than that.

Simone Weil—I always loved, if I’m saying her name right, am I? What? Simone Weil, Simone Weil—she calls prayer “unmixed attention.” Unmixed attention, like just what that is, that thunderous silence, unmixed attention in prayer. That is the kind of silent devotion the Buddha was offering at that moment.

Ayo also spoke about vulnerability and deeply listening to each other’s vulnerability, and not using that vulnerability as a weapon—not using someone’s or your own vulnerability to attack someone. That kind of devotion, and that prayer, and that unmixed attention, and that devotion, and that silence, that thunderous silence of impermanence, that you hear, that you can listen to, and it’s a gift. It’s a gift to receive and to give that, and it’s not used.

The fourth characteristic of silence is magnanimity. Magnanimity—a kind of generosity or elasticity. I spoke about this morning having an elastic life, a plasticity to us because we’re moving. And when we stop the movement with our thoughts and our rigidity of our mind, that’s the pain, that’s the suffering. We’re stopping something and we’re looking for, how do we release that?

I really felt that when I was laying in my bed, and I have a shagbark hickory outside my window. If you—this week, no, two weeks ago—did you experience those wild winds? Like, there was just these wild, wild winds, unrelenting, like these wind-eaties. I don’t know how many of them there were. They were all there. They were shaking the earth, like wildness.

And I don’t know if you’ve been in an earthquake. My first earthquake experience was in—I mean, there was a few in Pennsylvania that were small. I thought my brother was sneaking up on me and shaking my bed, and I was like, “Barry, stop!” Turned out it was an earthquake—because he would do that. But I remember in New Zealand, I was laying in my—I had a motel room at the time—and my bureau bent in a way that I never saw a bureau do! And I wasn’t on anything, and I didn’t have jet lag. And this shagbark hickory came alive like a person, bending and moving like I’d never seen a tree do before. And nothing broke.

You see that with trees—if they get rigid and stiff, that’s why they’re so soft inside. So it’s kind of like our posture. It’s like we remain soft inside, but we have this architecture that holds us. So it’s kind of getting those two in alignment, where we can remain soft inside, but yet we’re holding ourselves up as well. But we have to be elastic. So that’s what he says—that silence has to have that kind of elasticity, that magnanimity of being movable.

And Buddhist teachings, of course, are vast. They’re vast in characteristic. There’s nothing to pin down. They don’t do that. There’s no dogma in Buddhist teachings. It’s just not like that. It’s very vast. And that’s why this Buddha’s silence is so important to us. It’s just so vast. And he’s pointing to our vastness.

So we sit down to do zazen, and we put ourselves right in the middle of the universe, and we master ourselves there. We taste silence with our whole body and enter the wholeness with everything here—with the doors, with the floor, with the trees, with each other—something we can’t pin down. And the more we practice, the more wonderful flavors and tastes ooze from our study, from our effort, from our life.

It’s tasty, and difficult to tell others how tasty it is, because it’s impermanent. And it’s not something we can pin down, but we can sure share it. Like last night, or one of these nights this week, I leaned against a shoji screen, and it wasn’t a wall. Of course, it fell right over. But right at that moment, it felt like a wall, but it just went badoonk! That’s how words and forms are in impermanence. We lean on them, but they fall. They fall.

And painters and poets—what Hakuin’s doing, he’s trying to express silence using materials. We use words, we use music, we dance. There’s always an experience of lack of complete satisfaction. I was talking about this on the art Zoom, because silence is not something that completely can be expressed in a painting or a poem or in our activity. And that is our life. And that is the key. That is the energy of art. That is the energy of our highest art, of the precepts, is that it can’t be completed. And we have to live with that. We have to live with that. That is our complete, whole, complete, perfect life.

And we can’t do anything but keep trying to express the ungraspable with each other—the impermanence. And sometimes I just make noise. It’s like a suffering that can’t be stopped, just because we’re human and having a body and a mind. And so what do we do? We settle into stillness and silence of this breath, breathing body, and just depend on that sadness to be there and accept it and meet it with patience, with joyful effort, with generosity, with loving kindness.

It keeps us connected. Like, compassion is to suffer with, to suffer with. And then we can understand it in others, know our fear, know their fear, because we are one and the same in that way.

Zen teaching emphasizes right here, right now, because we always have the opportunity to touch silence. It takes a moment. You know, people say, “I’m not practicing.” I always—like, what does that mean? And it turns out they say, “I haven’t sat for a while.” So don’t put those two together. Like, if you started to practice, sorry, you’ve gone too far. You just can’t not practice. You can’t turn—it’s going to be really hard to turn that back, turn that dial back. Not sitting is one thing. And to make contact with why you need to sit down and be still and silent is really upon each of us to make that contact, because that’s going to help you.

I can’t tell you how tasty that is. I can tell you, but you’ve got to taste it. It’s so tasty. But teachers keep telling us and pointing, and for me too. But we only can tell the water is cold if we drink it ourselves. Is this cold? I wonder if this is cold. Ryan, can you tell me, is this cold? No. So, so what’s cold?

So, so you’re the walking temple, is what I’m saying. We’ve come to this temple, but we’re each a walking temple. And you can go in that door. Door’s open. You just turn around in a breath, and you will find stillness, spaciousness, and deep silence. Like, in that moment, just take a breath, you’re in the door, and be there—stillness, spaciousness, and silence. And then you can move. I think that’s the singing and dancing and the voice of the law.

Let it arrest you. Let’s all get arrested. Let’s all get arrested.

Thank you for listening.

As you'll hear, Dharma encounters begin with the introduction of a topic related to Zen practice and training. Students then volunteer to present their understanding of the topic or a question for the Dharma Encounter teacher to reflect on. The presence of fellow students means that anyone in attendance can benefit from the exchange. We hope you enjoy.

Good afternoon everybody. So Dharma encounter, it has an ancient history. It goes back to the time of the Buddha, and during the two rainy seasons, the disciples of the Buddha, the Buddha, the Arhats, would assemble for three months, twice a year. We call that Ango. And during that time, teachings would be offered, exchanges would happen, questions, explorations. So that's what's happening today at the end of the first session of Ango and will happen the next session and the third session.

Dayo will lead as part of his training, Shuso, and becoming a senior monastic with more responsibility for leadership and a model of practice. So part of this is training for him, but it's also part of training—an essential part of training—for the Sangha, for students. It's not always easy to come up in public and have an exchange, but I think you'll find if you do, as soon as you kneel down, you'll forget about the self-consciousness and you just—it'll just go.

The Dharma encounter is one of the methods of teaching very similar to—well, it's face-to-face teaching, very similar to dokusan or daisan, which of course is private, so we don't get a chance to see how others interact with their teachers. But here, it's public, so we all can benefit from the exchange that happens. The exchange can be very direct and directly pointing to the great matter. It could be a bit more conceptual; depends on what the student brings forth in response to what I'm about to offer and where they are, where they're coming from, what the opportunity is for something to be revealed.

Well, we've been studying as the central theme of the Sangha, the Eight Gates, which in my mind at least are a, quote, modern day equivalent of the Eightfold Noble Path. And it's the heart of the training matrix here. And these are not the Eight Gates. The Eightfold Dharma Path are not recipes for enlightenment and practice. They're a guide to the path that we can take up as our own practice. But each of us is karmically different. Each of us has to find a way in this practice. Each of us has to take up the teachings in a way that is relevant and meaningful and access it through our own practice.

So although we're united, I would hope, in a desire to awaken and to live a compassionate life that comes out of wisdom, each of us has our own individual life and karma, and that should be respected and understood by each of us as we take up this path and journey along. And it's challenging because so much of what we encounter in life takes us away from the path. There's so many, what I call, shiny objects out there, right? And it's perhaps not possible to avoid being entrapped.

I was just thinking of just going through life, so entering the medical system, or trying to arrange a program on TV through cable, or any of the other myriad ways that we interact with society and how difficult it is, how unhuman it is, and how tempting it is to respond in kind. And that's aside from our interactions with each other, both in the Sangha and outside the Sangha, and how easy it is to poison ourselves as we receive this entwining way of relating to our life. The world seems designed to entrap us in that way and to estrange us from ourselves.

And so we practice. We have awareness of that, but it's a challenge. Dharashi spoke earlier in the week about first encountering the precepts and how he saw it one way. But as he practiced, as his practice deepened, he began to understand it in much different ways. I had the same experience. I received jukai, another tradition, another school of Zen, and okay, I got it. I'm not killing anybody, right? I'm not stealing, right? Wrong. There's a lot of ways to kill somebody. There's a lot of ways to steal. And that only became clearer to me. It's a work in progress.

As my practice deepened, as I deepened within my practice, as I practiced with you, with my teachers. And that's an ongoing process. It has no stopping point, no mastery. And so that's really what I want to take up today. And the vehicle for that are three teachings from Maizumi Roshi.

Maizumi Roshi, as you may know, is the great—well, I guess, great-grandfather and the teacher of Daido Roshi, and technically the first abbot here. These teachings seem very simple and obvious, and you can come across them in many other ways, other than outside spiritual practice. But this is Maizumi Roshi. He wasn't offering psychological support for our practice. He wasn't denying that, but that's not what it was about.

So the first thing he said is: don't deceive yourself in this practice. Do not deceive yourself. At one level, it's straightforward, right? You know, like the precepts. Be clear, be honest. Know what you want. Know what you don't want. Seems simple. But where do deceptions arise from? I think we know where they arise from. Greed, even greediness for the Dharma, enlightenment, some gifts that we'll get as a result of our practice, something I'm due. The passions of anger, jealousy. Who has not had some hardcore reaction to what we've encountered? Or just ignorance. We just don't see it, right? We're pretty good at seeing it in others. But how do we deceive ourselves just because we're not aware of the depth of the teaching? We haven't gone there. We haven't looked.

Or in my own experience, when I've encountered teachings I couldn't relate to, I'm just not interested. Has no meaning. Until it did. Until, out of my desperation to address my pain and your pain, I had to investigate it. I had to see what it meant to me personally. And maybe starting with the conceptual. But that's just the beginning. And as we go along in practice, what we previously did not consider self-deception, we now begin to consider self-deception.

The second thing he said—and all three of these blend—is don't make excuses for yourself. That is really interesting. When you enter as a student, really, what that process is about, so far as I understand it, is you are giving permission for the teachings. That's what you're doing. And how does that work? So that's training as opposed to practice. I mean, it's not a sharp line; we're all practicing to one extent or another. But this is a training matrix. And even though you may not live here, you come here and practice. And when you practice, you enter to train. And in training, it's not necessarily what you want or what you want to hear.

So recently somebody asked me about training positions. And he said, every single thing in this monastery is a training position. And the person said, ""What? You mean when I wrap a package, that's a training?"" Yes, yes, that's training. Well, what's the difference between someone who wraps a package for mailing who's in training, and at FedEx, perhaps probably someone wrapping a package? Is there a difference? What is that difference?

We have an infinite capacity to make excuses for ourselves. And so as practitioners of the Dharma, we're giving permission to receive training, to receive direction, to receive. I may know better in any given situation, I may think, I know better. I've done this a million times. I remember the first time I came here. I was living at 9,000 feet in Colorado and heating with wood. I cut a summer supply of wood for the whole year. I mean, picture that. Me, my chainsaw, the trees, cutting, not getting hurt or killed, and then splitting it and then stacking it. You get many opportunities to lose weight doing that, and the stacking is crucial or it doesn't dry.

And I came here and they said, ""Go stack that wood. I'll show you how."" I said, okay. And they stacked it. And clearly they didn't know what they were doing. And I didn't say a word. Now, if it had been dangerous, I would have said it. And I knew that stack would fall down, but I didn't say a word. Maybe I should have, but that was the choice I made because I was so eager just to respond to the direction.

And these situations come up all the time. They come up in the kitchen. They come up every place here. And so we're asked to see our own mind. When the person says, ""Stack it this way,"" I see my own mind, ""But that's not the way. The person doesn't know what they're talking about."" Can I see that? Can I see that I might be angry about that? Can I see that some kid who's 21 is telling me how to stack wood, and I'm 35—I was actually older—and I know how to stack wood? What's my mind at that point? And what's the value in that?

And I'm not saying don't say something if, you know, a person is trying to change a chainsaw chain and doesn't know what they're doing and it's dangerous. Of course you say something. But I'm talking about—and that's training, too—when to step forward and when to step back.

And what does any of this have to do with zazen? Another interesting point of this. So what happens when we're brought up short? When I do something that is not skillful and hurts the other person and someone else, perhaps my teacher or sangha member, points that out—perhaps someone much junior to me points that out—where's my mind? How do I work with that? Do I make an excuse? And there's a lot of subtle ways of making excuses.

We see the obvious ones, right? In politics, ""I take full responsibility for this."" What does that mean other than the words, ""I take full responsibility?"" What's behind that? When we take full responsibility or we don't. And this is risky business, right? Because every interaction with somebody is risky business—may not come out the way you would like it to. How do you see that? How do you see your own mind?

My experience and my practice is that in every interaction, every difficult interaction or result of an interaction that I'm in (and I see it in others as well) is that I have contributed to that. Sometimes not obvious, sometimes it would seem to be all the other person's. But karmically speaking, it's worth looking at. How is that? How have I contributed to this? What's my responsibility to this? And then what do I do out of that? What is the skillful means of saying something? Not saying something, just taking it in.

And there's a more fundamental view of taking responsibility, which is the third point. Skipping—sorry. The third point is taking responsibility for yourself. So to take responsibility when you or I deceive, deceive each other, deceive me, when you make excuses for something that happened, that's crucial. How can you turn responsibility into acknowledgement and action? Again, it isn't enough just to acknowledge, ""Yes, I'm responsible."" What's the action? What should be the action in any given situation? Is there a cookbook for that?

At its most profound level, perhaps, maybe there's more. But from my perspective, at its most profound level, I quote Daido Roshi, who I think was quoting Zorba the Greek, and we heard him say this many times: ""You're responsible for the whole catastrophe, you and I."" How is that so? How can that be? How can that be? I mean, how can I be responsible for things that I seemingly have no control over, no input into? How can I be responsible for when I get cancer? It happened, happens all the time, without any apparent contribution on the person who's receiving that.

So in these simple instructions—take responsibility for yourself, don't deceive yourself, don't make excuses for yourself—it's all a practice, it's all there. And I'm not going to suggest any questions because it's all there. And I think you can supply the questions or the explorations or the answers. And so that's what I'd like to work with now.

In a moment, the line will be called. Anyone who's on that list in the back, anyone who's signed up for Ango is eligible. I would, as I've already said, like to encourage people who are in training who might hesitate to come up, because it will help you and it'll help me and us. But I also want to encourage more experienced people so that we get a good mix and we get beyond the entertainment of this day—wisdom and compassion.

So let's open up the line. And Dayo will start as part of his training. And he'll do three bows, entering and leaving. And everyone else will do one bow.

Before you start, can I say something? Congratulations on being Shuso. I think it's wonderful, and I wish you the very best. I didn't have a chance to say that. I wanted to say it.

Shoshanji, I'm taking responsibility if I just make it about me and you. Because that's what's alive straight in front of me right now. I've been interested in when I don't take responsibility, when I'm determined to blame you, blame the other, blame you. How hard I have to work that. It seems when I came into training, that I could say, like, ""Right, I'm giving you this thing. Right? That's your problem."" I've been interested in how many times a second, actually, I have to keep doing that. How exhausting that is. I didn't want to take responsibility.

This morning, I knew this was coming, and I'd done my bit for the week, and I wanted to take a morning off. I wanted to take a morning off. And I just, like, just—just go up there, say something that's okay. And then, you know, you started speaking. I'm quite—and then this.

Now, when we turn our life to the Dharma, the Dharma turns to us. And sometimes, and I'm speaking from my experience, your experience, the Dharma brings us kicking and screaming to clarity and compassion. And that's good. It's the Dharma. One way of understanding is it's a mirror. The Sangha, our teachers, the teaching, show us ourselves. And it's all good.

Do you know why it's all good? What you just described is all good. What makes it all good?

Because this—yeah. Because when I'm—when my eyes meet yours—yeah. When my eyes meet yours.

Are we one body or two bodies?

My eyes meet yours.

That's right. May your life go up.

Don't deceive yourself was one of the instructions. So if I practice well and I understand some, you know, I'm practicing out of self and other and not two. I'm the same as you, and so I shouldn't be deceiving you or me. And there's, like, a relationship there. And I'm working this out as I'm talking. You know, my language is the way it is.

So I guess my question is sometimes in conversation with someone who is not necessarily practicing, doesn't have an understanding of some of the Buddhist teachings. And we all do this. What we say is what we desire, what we wish, what we fear. It's coming out of something great, you know, and the thing for me is like, okay, how do I be with this person, like truthfully, but yet be kind? Because sometimes the two are—it's skill. It's not always available. So I just wondered if you had any advice.

What I do is fumble around. I do the best I can. And that's all you or I can do is the best I can. But I'm careful. And I've said this a number of times before. I have a checking question to myself too: Am I doing the best I can? Do you know what that is?

No, I don't know what that is.

Am I really doing the best I can or am I just using that as an excuse to not look any further?

Okay.

And that guides me because I don't always want to do the best I can. It hurts.

Well, and also, how about asking the person, you know, also like checking with them, ""Is this—I'm hearing what you're saying is such and such. Is that how you see it?"" I mean, to me that's how, like, I would just reflect something back. Hopefully, you know, I don't know. That's just—

That's a useful technique. It's helpful. It also shows interest in the other person and gives them an opportunity. But what's at the bottom of that?

Being with a person completely. Not separating myself. And for me, that's really a lot of training. It's a lot of training because I'm—I've come from a tradition of opinion, judgment and, you know, and smart alecky, you know, relationships. So this is really a turning around.

Well, you're the only one in the zendo who's like that.

Yeah, so we do. I mean, in this relative world where we're not in control of outcomes and we wish the best, hopefully for everybody. Yeah, we screw up all the time. And that's—thank you for your teaching. May your life go well.

So, Sanji, as I was listening to you give the opening for this, I thought I had so many questions, but when you get up here, things change. But I wanted to touch on ""don't make excuses for yourself,"" but let me frame that slightly differently. What I'm feeling these days is that seamlessness, the seamlessness of activity, of people with people and what we do and how we live our lives. When I come here, and especially this past week—and it's been leading up to this—just feeling that more and more and knowing that I want to explore that more.

And going through the training, there are some things that are becoming very apparent with the koan training, whatever. There seems to be something very common, very wonderful and difficult coming up. But one of the things I wonder, and I have, to be honest—well, this is the funny thing. Let me take full responsibility. And we've spoken about this, about doing some residency here, but I know myself and I think there are others like me. This is a really odd one to say. I know that most likely I know what I do and what I've done for most of my life. And my father used to talk to me about it in not so great terms. You know, in his Jamaican accent, he would say, ""Horace, why don't you go along and follow other people?"" I say, ""Daddy, I can't. I don't know what it is, but I can't."" I know, but training here is something. And I see that I'm, you know, that's going to happen.

But what about for people who—people for me, not people, for me—for doing really seamless, connected, honest training? And as I'm saying those words, I can already feel the bullshit coming out of my mouth, but I want to hear it back from you.

Training as a layperson, we don't have the obvious guardrails, right? And being fooled by media, being fooled by other people, and that's a very interesting situation. And you do choose your friends well. You're very careful about that. That's important. But what else? I mean, coming here, being involved, engaged, I just feel like I want to do more. And yet I feel like I'm doing what I can. But am I making excuses?

I can't answer for you. You know, I live at a distance. I can come here when I can come here, and I'm pretty careful about doing that as best I can, even though it creates some difficulty in my life, as it does with everybody. But to answer your question, my perspective of that rests in something underneath. Coming here and not coming here. How do I get training?

So I'll quote Sinclair Lewis, who talked about Aerosmith. ""A man is a person of married measurement."" A person of married measurement, which is not a compliment. And what's fearful for me personally is if I'm a person of measured practice, am I? In any given instance, it's not a yes or no answer ever. I mean, you can't sit here in sesshin, put your heart on the line and measure that. But there's a larger context, our life, that you're pointing to.

Yeah.

And so we have to weigh what you're weighing. And it's, as you say, it's coming up for you that this is how I live my life. I've set it up that way, or I certainly have responsibility that way. I've made commitments both here and elsewhere, and there's a tension between that. Right. And there's especially a tension—not attention—to what I want and enjoy and what I don't want at the end of my life, which is to look up and say, I don't want that. And I'm desperate for that not to happen. It's not going to happen. And so given that, that weight of that, which is real, I'm going to consider that very carefully. So that takes me to places that I'm not comfortable enough, that hurt to face, to what I cook.

I know you play basketball—to square up in front of someone that you're defending, who's better than you, but you're squaring up anyway, and they're going to score, and you're squaring up, they're not going to score.

Yeah, well, that's the internal dialogue. Sorry if it's non-relational, but that's—there's a determination there, which I hope we can each relate to—that in our own respective way, to wake up, and the clock is ticking, and I have to have the responsibility, face the responsibility of doing what I need to do, to do that, while doing my best to hold these other things. And there's a price. There's a price that you and I have to pay. It's not free. This practice is not free in that sense. And each of us has to determine in any given situation, time, place, what are we willing to do? Will we take a step that we know nothing about? It's a risk, right? Because we're abandoning something. I mean, it's the same risk that when you became a student, you didn't know what being a student meant. I mean, someone who recently became a student said to me, ""I had no idea what this was, but I knew I had to do it."" So it's yours. It can only be yours. And the karma of that is yours. May your life be well. Thank you for your teaching.

So, Shan Chi, these are questions I try to look into a lot. On the one hand, I tend to see the trees rather than the forest, so I can always find reasons. I tend to see things as complicated, which always helps me find a reason for this and a reason for that. So it's easy to find excuses. And fortunately, I've been in some situations where I saw my mind—I think because of my practice—I could see my mind go there, wanting, wanting, wanting a reason why it wasn't my fault, and I could find them. I mean, in a sense it wasn't. It was more complicated than that. It was true as far as it went and at the same time seeing. But that takes energy to sustain that point of view. And what kind of life do I want to live? Because that's like trying to hold a past together. This is what happened. This. This is what happened, holding that together. And I want to go forward into something better.

And so I'm lucky. There were a couple of situations like that where it was so strong to find a reason why it wasn't my fault. And I just decided not to do that, to take a step forward and say it was. And I discovered that when I did that with people, it built trust with them, which I wasn't expecting. I was thinking, well, they'll blame me or they'll think I'm incompetent, or they won't trust me anymore because I screwed up. But actually it's what builds trust between people to take responsibility, even when it actually is more complicated than it's my fault. Just to say, I don't know, it's like a step forward to make things right or at least better. It's really important for me to discover that.

And at the same time, it's always a very live question for me when that becomes an excuse not to cover the ground I stand on, not to—not to think I'm unworthy, to take the blame because I'm afraid, because I figure no one else will. It's up to me, you know, when does it become a not good thing?

Well, as they say in sports, levels of the game. So there's different perspectives here. One thing that helped me is that when I switched in my mind—and I've said this before—blame, because it's a lot of fun to blame you. You. I'm free of that. To contribution. And as I've mentioned before, I've never seen a difficulty between two people in which they both did not have a contribution. And so from my perspective, instead of blaming, your contribution is your business. It is not my business. Sometimes I have to remind myself of that. But that's how I understand it. But what about my contribution? And that's—this is quite a challenging way of looking at things, because you can imagine easily situations where there's no apparent bad things happen in relationship or whatever, and there's no apparent contribution of one party. The other party committed such a grievous deed. But it's always there in some subtle way.

And then beyond that, in terms of your responsibility, in terms of this practice, what is outside you in this world? What is outside you in a deep sense, not a relative sense?

Well, you could say there's a boundary, but it's always arbitrary where that boundary is.

Yeah, there is no boundary. Fundamentally, there is no boundary. That's what the Buddha awoke to. That's what you're—on a fundamental basis, there's nothing outside you. That's what we're practicing to realize. And then when you step into the relative world, we're full of boundaries. How will you hold that understanding and realization? And you're practicing that. That's what you're practicing in zazen. It's not something—oh, I haven't discovered it yet. You're discovering it breath by breath, by breath, by breath. Moment after moment after moment of shikantaza, you're discovering that. But it's not an idea to hold or a thing. It's much more subtle than that.

So given that, how do you take your practice and see past someone else's or my own insecurities, fears, and understand they're very little. We don't have to focus on them. We can just let them be. We don't have to fix them. We can accept ourselves as we are—sometimes fearful, sometimes not, sometimes this, sometimes that—and allow for that. You have to allow the space for that. That if—when something hurts or feels threatened, if we just run to the place that we've run our whole life, then there's no options, right? There it is. That's it. I'm ""safe."" Are you safe? You get a life now that's very limited, a life that's very limited, that's bounded by that.

And so we're given the Three Treasures. We're given this practice. We're giving each other to practice that. And it hurts. It hurts. I want to cry. It hurts to face that. It's like your long companion, your dog, has died. You loved your dog, but your dog is gone. So what will you do? And that's the essential question we face time after time. What will you do?

And luckily, what you've done a thousand times and now do a thousand a week. You still have an opportunity to see it, to study it, to work with it. To work with your teacher. To work with the Sangha. To work with your pain and go deeper. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

Shoshanji, some days I don't deceive anyone on earth. Some days I have deceived every single person. Some days I have no regrets. And some days I have hundreds of thousands of regrets. How is it for you?

Have a cup of tea. My heart is breaking. I cry. How is that all good?

Because it's real and it's the Dharma and it's who you and I are. And that's what I care about. How can I be I and you be you and we be together in that. And that is a good day.

Comrade, is that better than no thing?

Beats me. I don't know the difference. Thank you for your teaching.

I think I'm better at recognizing that my default program to receiving feedback for service instructions and whatnot is defense. I actually realized that in October when Gokhan gave me—Alex—October sesshin. At the end of sesshin, Gokhan gave me feedback.

Who gave you feedback?

Gokhan. At the end of sesshin—the sesshin is over. And then he came up and gave me feedback about holding incense. And I just started rambling off the reason why I'm holding it the other way.

He did or you did?

I did. I did, of course.

So why were you holding it the other way?

Because my way is the right way.

Exactly. But I beg to differ, my way's the right way. Now what are we going to do?

Well, I know what I want to do is to hold it the right way, the way that it is designed to be held. So I went back and I realized, wait a minute, there's something that I'm missing. And then I asked Joosan, okay, so how do you hold this again? And then I realized, oh, I've been holding it wrong all these years. So I realized he gave me a gift because it's the end of sesshin. He doesn't have to come up and be sure—he's tired. Or maybe he isn't. But, you know, assuming because people work hard here. And I realized when people are giving main instruction here, especially, they are giving me a gift. And it's so awesome to receive it. So obviously I'm not always happy to, you know, I have a resistance, but I'm learning to work with it.

So what's the gift?

Okay, this might sound a lot—hyperbole. It feels like love.

But suppose it didn't feel like love.

At least I can remember when it feels like love. And I can work with it when it's—when it feels like shit.

So it feels like shit. But what are you receiving? Where is the shit?

It's in my mind.

Well, what makes it shit? Or what makes it love? He's just showing you how to hold incense. He's not thinking love, shit.

Yeah, but I suppose this love is an antidote to my defenses. Maybe they melt, I don't know.

Well, love is a slippery topic. Slippery word. I respect it, though. But you've heard me say, turn everything towards the Dharma. So whether it's shit or love, I mean, you know, there's a koan, which—the answer is ""use toilet paper, shit stick as the body of the Buddha,"" I don't remember exactly the words. How can that be, whatever comes?

Well, how can that be, whatever comes? Is that a question for me?

Yeah.

How could, as Roshi said, really, ""It'll all be good. Every day is a good day. Every moment is a good moment."" What underlies that?

I feel like when I'm not there, when my self-centeredness is lessened, when I'm not there, it's fine.

Why is it fine? What's there when you're not there?

Everything else.

Exactly. Exactly. In that instance, without any duality, taking my words to mean anything other than that you are awake. And that's a fine day. A fine moment. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

Working in the kitchen, I find it hard a lot of the time to stomach that I have responsibility or that I have influence for the way that other people's practice goes. And that—yeah—that every moment I have a choice to guide that or to kind of look away and pretend like it doesn't matter so much. Or that what I think that people want from me in the moment is more important. And I struggle with that because I feel the weight of it.

You know, the middle way is not only wanting to be free of your fear and suffering and not only wanting others to be free from their suffering, but also deeply respecting that your karma is your karma and theirs is theirs. So their practice is their practice. And that's not, in one sense, a particular sense that we're talking about here. Your direct responsibility—your direct responsibility—is to offer what you're going to offer, what you, this person, can offer. Struggling, not struggling. In other words, offer your practice. And what's theirs is theirs. And that's how it is for all of us.

I mean, how often does somebody—do we do something with the very best of intentions, wanting the best for that person, and it doesn't go well? We're not in control of that. You're not in control of someone else's reaction. You're not in control of outcomes. Right. Can you feel that?

Yeah, we're desperately trying, but it doesn't really work. So what can we do?

I feel like there's times when I know that something is more skillful, but there's like a barrier there that I can't seem to surmount. Or, like, I know that people come in with their tendencies, and I know that they're here because they want to practice. But I don't know. I second guess, I guess, people's insincerity and my own—well, other people's sincerity.

Again, not in your control. And in a particular way, not your business. Right. Everyone comes into the kitchen, so start with yourself. And also, look at situations, ask for advice. This is what happened to Eduna. So only twice this week—just twice—did Shugen Roshi say, ""Well, you could have done this instead of said that, and maybe you wouldn't have hurt that person."" Only twice. I think I'm doing pretty good.

That was helpful. Oh, next time I'm in that situation, I don't have to—I can be more generous. So ask for help so that the next time—and that's how you learn to be skillful with your practice. And we need help. I need help. We all have a personality. We all have a personality that affects other people and goes into their reference system, right? And sometimes they're not that happy. Sometimes they love it, sometimes this, sometimes that. Doesn't matter. You have to work with it. And you have to be responsible for your job. That too. There's a job going on there, and we have to eat. You have to feed us.

So there's a lot of space there, a lot more space. When it seems that you can ask for help, ask for help. When it seems, ""No, I'll learn,"" do that. When none of that is applicable—sometimes it's not. The water just keeps flowing down the river. Can you live with that without poisoning yourself? You can practice that. May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

Shirasanji, do not deceive yourself. Think of the teaching: ""Wherever there's a sign, there's deception."" I feel like I use a lot of signs. I use a lot of language, and people use that around me, and it creates a lot of activity and pulls me in all different directions. There's all this energy to it, and there's this peace and tranquility in sesshin that I come to. And then going back to normal ways of interacting, all the signs come back. And how is it to be in that? How do we work with that?

Well, I'm cautious with ""wherever there's a sign""—what was the word you used? Deception.

Deception.

I don't know about that. I mean, sometimes you hear words that are real, true and honest. Right? Is that a sign?

I guess it's—there can be, like, an energy that is true, but it's still using, like, a finger pointing at the moon in a way. Like, it's just something that's representing something else.

Okay. What else you got other than the finger? It's like I say ""orange,"" and there's no—yeah, there's no—what else you got to say ""orange""? Hand me the—yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you have to—yeah, yeah, yeah. So what's the difference between ""Hand me the orange"" or ""Please hand me the orange""? What's the difference between—other than politeness, right?

Yes.

I'm feeling that, like, there's just an energy that we can offer with the ways that we use it. And that's—I feel like that's—

But there's more than that.

Uh-huh.

There's more than—yes, that's true. What's the kind of energy that nurtures, that offers, that truly offers? What is that kind of energy? Where does it come from?

It comes from just that realization that we're in it together. We're creating it together.

Yeah.

Practicing together. Or you're practicing, at least, if you're doing that. And so, yes, the ultimate truth maybe is beyond words and letters. The relative truth is not. And there is a relative truth, and they're not different. And we want to divide them up, right? So this is this, this is that.

Yeah.

But turns out reality is one whole piece. When we divide it, we suffer.

Yeah.

May your life go well. Thank you for your teaching.

So, Sanji, I am practicing just this responsibility for goodness. Palpable. True. Or so it seems to me, like an orchestra at times. True—people hurt people for real. That's all I have.

I cannot really comment, truly comment, honestly comment on what you're saying about your own practice. Because I don't know. I look at my practice and my vows, which almost always are right in front of me, and I think I do my very best to practice them—to do good. To do good for others, to not do evil. But I know there's more in my practice, and so I can't stop there. I can't say that's my vow and I'll live it. And I do live it. Maybe I can't say I do live it, because sometimes I don't. So—and I'm often blind to that. I get the feedback when I suffer. I get the feedback when the sangha, both here and in the world, offers me that. And that is my responsibility. And taking that up and studying that responsibility allows me to go deeper within myself. And it hurts. And I have to face my own ego and my own expectations and desires.

So although I cannot know your practice and how you understand it other than your words, I would just share that with you to see if it offers you anything.

Share what I said.

Yeah.

I love you.

I'm sorry?

I love you.

Yeah.

Yeah. It helps me.

Yes. Yes. I do. I do. We do. Thank you for your practice. Thank you for your teaching.

So, Yanche, at the most fundamental level, at the deepest level, I don't know who I am. And at that level, everything feels like a deception. Any face forward I put is a deception. It's—behind that face is just—I don't know.

Thank you for offering that.

I know I don't want to hurt. I know if I do something, I guess I see reflections of—whatever semblance of a self I'm putting forward comes back. I see that I hurt people. But I also see that people project to me that I'm smart or funny or this or that. But when I'm home alone in a cabin, alone, that all falls away. And I don't know. I think it's just an act.

Can you use that desperation? Can I use it to help you and others?

It's what brought me here.

Yeah.

I use it every day. That's the path.

Thank you for sharing that. Because that's all a path.

Yeah. Every day, you know, you wake up in a simple room with very few things, and you come and you live almost the same day that you lived before. Every day is the same day. So some days are good, some days are bad. You wake up and come down and you practice. Good days, bad days.

That's right.

Yeah. Just keep going. But you use that energy of that desperation. Don't just keep going blindly. Use it. Be smart. I'm cursing you. I would never live up to that. But seriously, we all face this, and what we do then is what matters. And we all face it if we choose to see it, if we choose to look. May your life go well. Thank you very much.

It occurs to me that this is the founding sesshin. Is that right? The founding sesshin. And when I come to the sesshin, sometimes I wear this rakusu, which is Daido's rakusu, and one of his. And that—what he founded and paid a price for—is a gift that we cannot repay. We just can't. But we have to try. And we have to try because our lives are at stake. And the lives of many other people are at stake. And these are getting to be terrible times, maybe much more terrible. We'll see.

Still, from a practice way of practicing, every day is a good day. That's up to us. We have power. And that power is in the Dharma, in this practice. And in our own way that's appropriate to each of us, we can choose to center our life around it. Not even saying you have to change anything, although you may. But certainly it's a change in view. Whether we want that or not. Or are we ready for that? You've seen people come up and have all different perspectives, as do you and I. But there is a karma. And we live that karma. And it extends out way beyond our ken. It goes and it goes.

Just as some guy 2,500 years ago said, ""Shit, there's gotta be more than this. There has to be more than this."" And here you are. Here I am. And we can offer that. We don't have to be some idea of a deeply enlightened person. I don't know what that means. We just have to practice. We just have to. I mean, in a way, what we talk about is a fundamental integrity, self-deception. What kind of self are we talking about? It's just you. It's just your life.

So let's do this together. Let's practice together. Let's have a life together. Together and apart. Together. It's up to us. This whole life, except us. May our lives go well. Thank you for listening.

**Bai Zhang and the Fox**

**The Main Case:**

Whenever Master Bai Zhang gave teisho on Zen, an old priest sat with the monks to listen and always withdrew when they did. One day, however, he remained behind. Bai Zhang said, ""Who are you standing here before me?"" The priest said, ""I'm not a human being. In the past, in the time of Kasho Buddha, I was the head of this monastery, and once a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall into causation or not?' And I replied, 'They do not.' Because of this answer, I was made to live as a fox for 500 lives. Now I beg you, please say a turning word on my behalf and release me from this fox body.""

The priest then asked Bai Zhang, ""Does an enlightened person fall into causation or not?"" Bai Zhang said, ""They do not ignore causation."" Hearing this, the old priest was at once enlightened, making a bow to Bai Zhang, and said, ""I have now been released from the fox body, which will be found behind the mountain. I dare to make a request of the master. Please bury it as you would a deceased monk.""

Bai Zhang had the ino strike the gavel and announce to the monks that there would be a funeral for a deceased monk. After the midday meal, the monks wondered aloud, saying, ""We're all in good health. There's no sick monk here. What is this all about?"" After the meal, the master led the monks to a rock behind the mountain, poked out a dead fox with a staff, and cremated it.

In the evening, the master ascended the rostrum in the hall and told the monks the whole story. Huangbo thereupon said, ""This old priest failed to give the correct turning words and was made to live as a fox for 500 lives. You say? If, however, their answer had not been incorrect each time, what would they have become?""

Bai Zhang said, ""Come here and I'll tell you."" Huangbo then stepped forward to Bai Zhang and slapped him. Bai Zhang laughed out loud, clapping his hands and said, ""I thought the foreigner's beard was red, but I see that it's a foreigner with a red beard.""

**Wumen's Commentary**

Not falling into causation—why were they turned into a fox? Not ignoring causation—why were they released from the fox body? If you have an eye to see through this, then you'll know that the former head of the monastery did indeed enjoy their 500 happy, blessed lives as a fox.

**Wumen's Poem**

Not falling, not ignoring.  
Odd and even are on one die.  
Not ignoring, not falling.  
Hundreds and thousands of regrets.

You know, the nice thing about having the opportunity to give talks on these koans is that they keep opening up, revealing. So this is from the Wumenkan; the other day I took it from the Book of Serenity, and so they're slightly different, same basic story.

And so this question or this matter: causation. The Buddha said it is essential that we study it, examine it, understand it, have faith in it. I read from Dogen, who was very clear, unambiguous, about the importance of having deep faith in causation. And he's—teachers don't really ever say anything new. In a sense, that's the point, right? It's sort of antithetical to our time, where, you know, even if you're just a tube of toothpaste, you have to come out with something new every few months. Really, the responsibility of the teacher is to be true to the Dharma that has come down.

Yes, of course, each person speaks about it in their own way, and there's a newness, a freshness to that. But the Dharma itself does not need improvement, in a sense, or innovation.

Nagarjuna said, ""If you deny cause and effect in the worldly realm, as some people outside the Way do, you negate this present life as well as future lives. If you deny cause and effect in the realm of practice, you reject the Three Treasures and the Four Noble Truths."" Which means, in a worldly sense, it will be hard to live within Buddha Dharma. It will be very hard to practice.

Cause and effect—one clearly seems to lead to the other. And in that, there's apparent duality. And the teachings speak about: there is cause, there is effect. One of the images or metaphors that's used is of a seed: that when the seed sprouts and begins to send down roots and send up leaves and branches, it's no longer a seed. The causal relationship is there, but the seed is no longer existent. It's now—there is no seed, there's a sprout.

Master Dogen, in the Genjo Koan, said, ""Firewood turns to ash and does not turn into firewood again."" If you think of this in terms of cause and effect—but do not suppose that the ash is after and the firewood before. We must realize that firewood is in the state of being firewood; the cause is in the state of being cause, and has its own before and after. Yet, having before and after, it is independent of them. It is a complete moment, a complete entity, without any fixedness, without any solidity, without any self.

Ash is in the state of being ash, Dogen says, and has its before and after. Just as firewood does not become firewood again after it is ash, so after one's death, one does not return to life again. So we cannot go back to the cause. We cannot go back to anything.

If you just had the most splendid period of zazen—kiss it goodbye, it's already gone. You cannot keep it. Why would you want to? In a sense, keeping it might presume that this is it, this is what there is, this is as deep, as broad, as insightful, as important as it is. And wanting to get away quickly from what a difficult period of zazen is—also presuming that there is something wrong with that, that that has nothing to offer.

There is no intrinsic good or bad, right or wrong. There is no intrinsic nature to anything. That's what the Buddha realized. Everything—all of us, animate, inanimate, as the Buddha said, within the human realm. Whether we speak of it as a state of becoming—I find that a little problematic, because it's as though it is becoming something, but it is always becoming, so it never arrives. It's sometimes also spoken of as process. I don't know, it sounds a little bit like being on an assembly line, you know. I don't know what the right way of speaking of it is, but the point is, it's alive.

And so the Buddha said, in this moment, you are having an experience. You are experiencing this because of causation, causal actions and results that are bringing you to this experience, this experience to your awareness. In this moment, it doesn't belong to you. You can't keep it. It is not you.

He said, it is only to be experienced—hear only what is heard, see only what is seen. Everything is empty of its own power, its own being, its own origination.

And yet we're deeply affected by things. That's our sentience. It's a good thing, right? What if we were like—I mean, maybe stones are affected. They certainly do change. We don't know what they feel. We feel. Would you want to not, maybe sometimes, but don't wish on that.

So it's: how do we hold this sentience? How do we hold this feeling, sensing, perceiving, body and mind? A word is spoken and you feel love, trust, inspiration. A word is spoken and you get angry, distrustful, or feel helpless. We are affected by actions. That's why actions are important.

The Buddha recognizes how powerful language is. He said, know what you're going to say before you say it, think about its influence. Where is it coming from? Does it need to be said? Is it helping? The effects we experience—that can seem short, that can seem long. People can carry the consequences of actions their entire lives. Maybe you know some who have. And usually there's a point at which there's an investment in not putting that down.

We can carry guilt and remorse. We can carry anger and resentment. That's why forgiveness is so important. Forgiveness is the ability to forsake your right to carry that grudge. You can—it's your right. Nobody can take that away from you. But you forsake that right. For what? For why? And the beauty of that is you can forgive someone who isn't asking for your forgiveness.

We can apologize to somebody meaningfully, deeply, and they not accept it. But no one can prevent us from offering that. We don't have to wait for someone's request to forgive.

A realized being does not fall into cause and effect and was made to live 500 years as a fox. So as I said the other day, seems pretty clear to be punishment. That's an ordinary way of looking at it.

In the moment of firewood, there is only the state of firewood being firewood. In the moment of a cause, there's only that state of a cause. Because nothing is fixed. Everything is not only subject to change, is changing. Habits are either getting stronger or getting weaker. The views that we hold are either becoming more entrenched or not.

I remember years ago, there was somebody in residence—no, they weren't in residence, they'd been in residence, they were living nearby—I was seeing them in dokusan, and they said they were in a corporate job that they hated. I mean, they spoke about it with like, I could feel the hate. And every day she had to go in for this job because she had signed a contract. She had three months left. She had already secured a new position, which she was very excited about, which made the three months still in this job even harder. And she was a practitioner.

And I said, what if you don't make it to the end of these three months? What if you die before that happens? And I said, you made an agreement to give them your best. You've got three months left. Is this helping you, actively hating this? How can you practice this? I said, until those three months are over, this is the rest of your life. If you think of it that way, there is no after, there is no next. This is it.

I remember talking to one of our incarcerated students who had been up for parole countless times, and because of the nature of his crime, he was probably never going to be released. And every time two years would come around, he would get so enthused and do so much work and work so hard and garner so much support to be released, and then it would be denied and he would just be crushed and fall into a depression and then he would rouse again. And I witnessed this over many years. And finally one day I said to him, I said, look, why don't you work hard towards being paroled, but imagine that you are never leaving this place. And he looked at me like—well, you can imagine how he looked at me. He did not hear these as words to be heard, as something to consider. And I understood, I got that.

But it was the clutching, the investment, the attachment to the result that he wanted and many thought rightfully deserved, that was keeping him alive. And I said, but it's also killing you. Is there another way?

There's a koan where a great ox—huge, bulky head, chest, torso—passes through a window, but its tiny little tail won't pass through. Why? And the commentary to that said, if it passes through—the whole ox and the tail—it falls into a ditch. If it doesn't pass through, it's destroyed. But isn't the point to pass through? Aren't we trying to cross over to the other shore? Why, if it passes through, does it fall into a ditch? And if it doesn't, it's destroyed. What now?

Master Sansheng asked Xuefeng, his teacher, ""The golden fish that's passed through the net, what does it use for food?"" This is the image, metaphor for an enlightened being. A golden fish passes through the net, no longer caught. Now what does it use for food? And Xuefeng said, ""I'll tell you when you come out of the net.""

I mentioned a koan the other day: ""An ascetic who is pure and undefiled will not enter Nirvana. A monastic who breaks the precepts will not fall into hell."" This is one of the ways in which the koans in many religious teachings can be so powerful. Because they startle us, right? They do not conform to our idea of how things work. In fact, they seem to often contradict it directly. So are these—is that statement contradicting Nagarjuna? Dogen?

It's so difficult to not assume a self, it's just kind of automatic. And even as we are within the practice of the Dharma, having faith in selflessness, practicing to realize that, bringing those words to our mouth every day—in the midst of that, we continually assume that there is a self. It reveals itself in our language all the time. It's just so strong.

If enlightened beings are not free of causation, then how are they, can they be liberated? How can we be liberated? I spoke about this the other day. Is it just a matter of mitigation, diminishing? That's not what the Buddha was looking for. That's not what he realized.

Is being turned into a fox punishment for the wrong answer? If it's wrong is wrong, then there is no freedom. If he's right, then it seems to contradict all these other teachings.

Having deep faith in causation, Dogen says, do not try and avoid this. Do not try and get away from this. Is there a path beyond right and wrong? Is there a path beyond passing through and not passing through? Not blind to cause and effect, not confused by it, not ignorant of it?

When we realize the self is empty, all the constituent aspects of the self are empty. Everything we give rise to, every action, every gift, everything received—do we stop eating, bathing, practicing, cleaning our room, feeling pain? When an ordinary person realizes it, they become an enlightened being. When an enlightened being realizes, they become an ordinary person.

All of this is pointing to the basic point. All of these teachings have everything to do with not falling, not ignoring, not falling, not ignoring—have everything to do with the basic point. That's why when we practice and we sit, we don't sit and try to, you know, dig up all of our history. Okay, let's deal with it one by one, so every one of our actions, every one of our memories, every one of our—they line up in a queue. You can't even see the end, right? You got to deal with each one of them. We don't do that. I hope you're not doing that.

You just sit. You wait. And if the mind is receptive, if we're practicing alert and relaxed—because even if our mind, even if we think I am open and receptive, the body can be saying, ""No way, baby. It's not coming in."" That's why it's not just a matter of comfort and ease in meditation, but it's ease—it's opening doors and windows.

And if we just sit, and with a courage, some courage for whatever, for whenever you might need it, then whatever arises, it arises because this is the time. This is the time when that past action has ripened into this moment. That doesn't mean you will think it is the right moment or that you are ready or that you are ripened for this. But that's just our opinion.

What is the middle way that even to say goes beyond all apparent opposites? See, this is where language just—and it's like, ah, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't, that doesn't. The language is—we got to use it, right? It's what we got. But its whole standard is essentially the standard of dualities. It functions in the world of things. It functions to make things clear between a subject and an object. It functions to define, to describe, to limit, to add certainty, to know.

In working in the Bodhisattva path, there is no book. There are lots of books, but there's no essential book. There's no book for you like you're operating a manual, right? So you won't run into a particular kind of jam—just look in the index, it'll be there. Turn to page 24: In the event that this might happen to you, this is what you do. You're the book. It's being written, which means we have to find our way. We have to take refuge.

Years ago, when I was very active in the prison work, I was in the prison at Green Haven, and we were doing zazenkai, and one of the students told me that somebody had recently stolen his radio. I said, ""Okay."" And he said, ""Well, you know, according to prison law, I have to deal with this."" I said, ""What does that mean?"" He said, ""I have to go get it, and then I have to teach this person a lesson."" I said, ""What does that mean?"" He said, ""You are not going to do this again, and I'm going to make you suffer so that you don't do it again. And I have to do that for that person also to communicate to everybody, don't mess with me."" And I said, ""Okay. What about that rakusu hanging around your neck?"" And he said, ""But if I don't do that, then everyone will think I'm weak."" I said, ""Are you weak?"" And I didn't mean physically—I mean, that was clear, he's not weak—but I said, ""Are you weak in your heart?"" And he said, ""No."" He said, ""I don't really even care about the radio. I just don't want to become prey.""

And I said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to try and tell you what to do. I can't do that, right? You're, in a sense, the expert here. You're the one who's taken vows. But understand that in this path, sometimes you have to stand alone. You have to go a different way and find out. Because if you don't do that, you'll never know if there's another way. We'll just keep doing the same old thing, assuming that is the only truth there is.""

Some weeks later, when I was back, I saw him again. And I said, ""What happened to that radio?"" And he said, ""Well, I went to the guy, because he knew he had done it, and the guy was prepared for a fight. And this student said, 'Look, I know you took my radio.' He said, 'I make a gift of it to you. I want you to have it.' And then he walked away."" And I said, ""What happened next?"" And he thought for a minute, he goes, ""Nothing."" I said, ""You told me that if you did that, you would become prey."" And he goes, ""Yeah."" I said, ""Why do you think this played out the way it did?"" He goes, ""I don't know."" And I said, ""When you went to talk to him, were you afraid?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Think about that. What were you communicating beyond your words?""

Living 500 happy, blessed lives as a fox. In one moment, an enlightened being does not fall into causation. In the next moment, living 500 years as a fox. Three months left at a job you hate—transform that hatred.

I remember also at Green Haven, many years ago, there were two of the main key members of the sangha, very powerful people. I don't mean they were physically strong, but I mean just powerful as people. They could have done anything in the world if they'd grown up a little bit differently. And they were fighting with each other. And it was a long, simmering, festering feud that was affecting the whole sangha.

And I was there with Daido Roshi. He was, I think, doing a zazenkai, something—he was giving a talk, probably something about atonement or the precepts or something like that. And during the middle of this talk, and one of the sort of rules I was told once while I was there was—in prison, you never show your sweat, which means if you're afraid, if you're nervous, you do not show that. Right? It's sort of a hyper, sort of, you know, idea of masculinity.

And in the middle of this talk, one of the two got up, walked across the zendo—he was shaking, I remember that, he was shaking, there's a big man—and he walked across to the directly standing in front of this other person. And I thought, okay, what's happening? Be ready for anything. And he started doing prostrations. Then he turned around, walked and sat down, and Daido Roshi just watched and then continued. It spoke so completely, and that in that place, at that time, to be so vulnerable, willing to make the first move.

If we want the currents in our life to shift, they will. That's their nature. Then why is it that sometimes things seem so intractable? Because they're strong, because they're deep. Because there are things we don't yet understand. Because we can gain more skillfulness, so that we can develop patience and compassion. So that we can understand ourselves.

As I've mentioned, along with Shugen, who's sitting Dungaryo mana today, have been collecting narratives—really he's been collecting them, interviewing some of the sangha members who were here at the very, very beginning—because I wanted to capture... Doesn't have a title yet, this unpublished work, but I think I said something, some title, and then it's an informal, incomplete narrative of Zen Mountain Monastery. Because I wanted to be clear, this is not definitive. This is just a collection of remembrances. So that—because when I first came here, late '84, early '85, I had no idea what had happened before me. I walked in, it was like, oh, it's this. It's just this, you know, I guess it's always been like that. I didn't know who had come before me. I didn't know what had been going through. I didn't know what. I didn't know anything. I just took it at face value, oh, this is a mountain monastery. And so I figured naturally that's probably what people do. There's nothing wrong with that.

But I thought I want to find a way to convey for all of us, particularly new folks coming in or newer, to have a sense of this living organism. I wanted to read just a little bit, give you a little taste. This is from Yushin, Daido Roshi's wife at the time, who came here—and we should do endless bows to her because she was so important in the beginning. When they first arrived, she said, we got out and walked up the driveway. She held Eshin's hand, their child. As we got closer to the building, my seven-year-old boy broke away and ran around to the left side. She was preoccupied with him, so she couldn't really look at the monastery. Then she grabbed his hand and they went to the front door. It was locked or stuck. They couldn't get in. He tried to get in through one of the windows. She said most of the windows were broken. And she said, no, no, no, don't do that. We can't go in.

So then they came around the east side, and Daido was down there. And they saw the Christ figure. And remember that Daido Roshi grew up Catholic, left the church, and he stood there and he said, ""Look at this. What is this place?"" She said he looked pale, took a few breaths. There were tears in his eyes. He held onto the blue stone. Can you just imagine that?

The first time they went inside, the next visit, she said they pushed open the massive front door with its ornate, sculpted hinges and stepped inside. Scary. The light bulbs were mostly burned out. The place was filthy. The dining room was a mass of broken tables, benches, chairs. There was a terrible odor, a combination of sewage and sweat. I could hardly step into the kitchen. The last people to use it had left a pile of pots and pans and dishes in the sink. Dried out bubble gum was stuck everywhere. That bubble gum was still here when I came. In fact, it was a series of caretaking tasks to scrape it off under tables, on the benches, on the walls—left behind by many of the decades of young campers.

Then they went upstairs and saw what is now the zendo—had 30 pews along the sides, like that one in the back, that's the one remaining. No altar, just some candles on a table. But Daido saw it as our future zendo for sure.

They moved into what we used to call the parsonage, the former Jizo house, which David, his son—one of his sons who came here—said was so unbelievably disgusting, like he couldn't believe what had happened here to make this place look like this. She said, but there was no heat. They had a little wood stove, I think, she said. There wasn't even electricity, she said. Daido drank camp-style coffee, that's for sure, boiled on the wood stove, smoked cigarettes—yeah, that's for sure—as he wrote out our schedule on a pad of paper: the daily schedule, she said, the same one we follow today, almost 45 years later.

She says zazen was paramount to Daido, and we sat every day and held a short service, even when there were only a few of us in the freezing main hall. There were electric heaters, but the electric heat was so unbelievably expensive that they rarely used them. We wore coats and hats and gloves when we sat down and burned everything we could in the fireplace in the dining hall.

David, Daido Roshi's son, who's about my age, said—I remember he came here and spent about a year here. He was a cook, he did whatever needed to be done, he's a beautiful guy—he said, I remember that first winter, we'd be sitting in the zendo, Yushin would sit with us and then take off to make dinner, be with Eshin. It would just be Daido and me sitting, him and his father. It wasn't unusual that first winter that it would just be the first of us sitting in the zendo.

Daido emphasized the schedule, and we followed it. I don't think I realized at the time how important that was, but the schedule, in a sense, held the place together. Daido's attitude was, ""I don't care if there's nobody in the zendo but me. We sit."" An action, an intention, sincerity, commitment, perseverance, faith. But these need to be grounded, right? They're not just abstract, kind of floaty, let's-feel-good-about-these-things.

What are they grounded in? They're grounded in the Three Treasures. They're grounded in the teachings. Most importantly, they're grounded in you. In your body and mind, in your living experience. And there's nothing flighty about them. It's like food, they're like air. They're the stuff we rely upon. And they grow. That's the thing—no roots, no branches, no place they can be found. But they do grow, these virtues.

So Daido Roshi, in no small way, did all of that for today. Make no mistake, he was thinking about the future beyond him, when we did not, could not even hear his words. We would just go, mama, when he would be talking about the day when he was no longer here. Like, no, I cannot even think about that. But he was. That's love. That's devotion. That's love for the Dharma, love for the sangha here, the sangha to come.

And so that schedule, those people sitting in this zendo, they did what needed to be done at their time. We do what we need to do in our time. That's what we've been given. That's what we give.

What could be better? Thank you for listening.

37824,"Audio","Active","Administrator","2025-03-28 12:59","BA20","","Zen Mountain Monastery","Fusatsu: Wholesome And Unwholesome Actions","","Common to virtually all the schools of Buddhism are the ten wholesome and unwholesome actions. In our lineage, the Bodhisattva Precepts—the primary practice of the Bodhisattva Path—are the Paramitas. See how the Bodhisattva cultivates the qualities of a Bodhisattva, refines themselves, and gives of themselves.

In the Prajna Paramita Sutra, the Buddha said that the Bodhisattva, this great being, when they course in the Six Perfections—which means to practice, embody these six perfections—whatever gift they might give, they make this common to all beings and then turn it over to the Supreme Enlightenment. They offer up the merit of that action, of that giving, to Supreme Enlightenment, and all of this without taking anything as a basis, without abiding anywhere, holding on to anything, solidifying anything. Whatever morality they guard, when they coerce in this, they cultivate the Six Perfections with this mindful reflection:

If I do not give gifts, then I'll be reborn in a state of woe, and there will be no maturing of beings that I can be a part of. In other words, I won't be able to mature other beings, be of service, nor will I purify the Buddha field, nor will I gain all-knowledge wisdom.

It occurs to the Bodhisattva: If I don't guard my morality, then there will be a rebirth for me in the three states of woe, and I won't be reborn among people or in an advantageous state. Therefore, I won't be able to be of service to mature other beings, nor will I purify the Buddha field or gain wisdom.

It occurs to them that if I do not develop patience, then my faculties will go to pieces, and I will not course on the path of the Bodhisattva, and I cannot help mature other beings.

It occurs to them: When I become lazy and do not develop the path of a Bodhisattva, do not exert vigor, then how can I fulfill the Buddhadharmas? How can I gain wisdom?

It occurs to them that if I become entangled in my distracted thoughts and cannot train in all of the qualities of concentration, I won't be able to mature other beings, help, be of service, alleviate their suffering. How much less, then, can I gain the knowledge of wisdom?

If I am weak in wisdom and skillful means, then I will not fulfill the perfection of giving. If, rather, I fulfill the perfection of giving or practice through meanness, the perfection of morality; if I try to practice a perfection of morality through immorality, or the perfection of patience through ill will, the perfection of vigor through sloth, the perfection of meditation through distraction, the perfection of wisdom through ignorance, then I will not fulfill these Six Perfections. I will not go forth to wisdom. I will not be able to be ultimately of service to all beings.

So it makes it clear, as the teachings do in the Mahayana, in a hundred thousand different ways, that to liberate the self is to liberate others. Our training is to help us develop; it is also to help us be of service. And so an essential part of that is understanding the nature of causation.

A greatly cultivated person does not ignore causation. They are not dark to the workings of karma. They are not confused by actions and their consequences. They do not ignore the conditions of their actions, their intentions, the results, the impacts. A person in practice does not indulge in apathy, complacency, laziness, numbness, particularly in relationship to causation, to live a Dharma life. And it can seem like a very strenuous life because the currents of our habits are strong.

So it takes, for a while, a particular amount of diligence, vigilance, even conscientiousness, resilience, stamina, perseverance, sincerity. And there's much in the teachings that emphasizes our own practice, right? Our own individual, personal effort—those qualities that we're cultivating, those attachments that we have, the struggles that we encounter, how we can practice those, encounter those struggles. Because, of course, that's essential.

But the teachings also acknowledge that there are many ways to be born into this world. There are many ways to move through a lifetime. And those things matter too: the time in which you were born, the place, country, the neighborhood, the family, the government, the wealth or poverty the parents were born to. Is it a time of peace or war? Is it a time of compassion or meanness? Is it a time of freedom or oppression? These things also matter.

Buddhism speaks about this in terms of favorable and unfavorable conditions. It recognizes that it's not just a matter of individual effort and individual practice. So it speaks of how there are unfavorable conditions that we can be born into. We can think of this, in one sense, in terms of rebirth and different realms of existence, which is how it's presented: being born into a hell realm, being born into the realm of a hungry ghost. You can think of that quite literally, but we can also think of it as it is and always has been, in terms of the realms that we create on a day-to-day basis—the tendencies that we have to create certain kinds of worlds within ourselves and around us.

And yet, even though they're considered unfavorable, and some of them are more decisive in terms of their impact, most of them are unfavorable but subject to change. To be born in a hell realm, which is characterized by a life, a world, a time, an inner state of endless conflict, of disruption, of fighting, of anger, of hatred, retribution, pain and suffering. And in this hell realm, it's not just that this comes and goes, but it's sort of the dominant flavor, it's the overarching and underwriting quality of that life. It's the landscape, it's what occupies that person's thoughts, their concerns, their needs. It's the dominant view.

To be born as a hungry ghost, to be born in a lifetime, or in one moment, or in a period of our life, driven by insatiable desire, an unquenchable thirst. This is a place where we can never be satisfied. But there is endless pursuit nonetheless—searching, wanting, plotting, but never being able to satisfy. It could also be a place where desires are easily, endlessly satisfied: the store is always open, shelves are always full, you always have enough to get something, there's always something you want to get. And the belief in an end to this, any ultimate satisfaction, any true happiness, is faded. For the hungry ghost, it's no longer about that. It's just about shopping, searching, seeking, wanting. Here there is only the day to day, moment to moment wanting, hunger, thirst.

To be born as an animal—let's understand this as a metaphor, let's leave the animals alone. In Buddhism, to be born in the animal realm is a world, a life governed by rules, routines, impulses, instinct. In the sense of an instinctual drive, it's a drive that you don't really have much of a choice about. You know, the Canadian goose doesn't think, ""I'm not going south this year, I'm done with that."" In this world, the demands of those rules and routines leave no room for examination or questioning. They just are to be followed. And so each day is a movement through that world of routines, through that world. In a sense, it's a kind of dogmatic life, a kind of tyrannical life that's really just moving from one fear to another, one forestalling of exposure or failure. The rewards are few; punishments, the threat of punishment, is ever-present.

Remember, these are unfavorable conditions, not conducive, because in each of these realms, the landscape, the life in that realm, is so consuming, it's so demanding, it requires so much of our attention just to live there, to make it, that there's just not really much room for anything else, any other consideration, any other possibility.

To be born among the gods: here you're far removed from the noise and the pain and the hunger. It all seems good all the time. There's no adversity, no real problems, no growth, no need to grow. Everything's good. No need to reflect. What would you reflect on? You get everything you want, everything has been gained, everything is being provided, nothing is lacking. So it's a world of abundant richness that never goes beneath the surface. It's just a world of riches. Here there's no empathy, there's no need for empathy, there's no concern, no need for concern. Everyone around you is in the same situation. You don't need anything, they don't need anything, you don't really need anyone—a rich and superficial life where one takes all they can get and doesn't really need to give anything back.

And then there's being born among those with pervasive false views, in a world where everything runs like normal according to a very particular and pervasive view. Here everything is clear and true and certain. It's a life of convictions, unexamined confidences that are actually laced with anxiety, strong opinions and beliefs. The important matters are already understood. What is not yet understood either doesn't need to be, or will be. Patience is a weakness. Questioning is disloyalty. A world of walls and boundaries where there is a truth that is known, and those who do not know those truths are enemies.

And so, again, in each of these realms, we can imagine, or maybe we've been, visited some of these, and how inclusive it becomes and exclusive at the same time. So these are all subject to change. They can change because there is no absolute, absolute. There is no world that is absolutely defined by any of these qualities. There is no person that is defined by any of these qualities. So they're always subject, open to the possibility of change. Even in the darkest night, the slightest bit of light offers a surprising amount of illumination.

To be born where no Buddha has appeared in the world—this is more problematic. Here your mind stirs, you give rise to a sense of dukkha. You don't know that word, but you know something, you feel it, you're experiencing it, you're wondering about it, you're questioning it. There's a healthy dissatisfaction that is born. There's a seeking mind that begins to come into presence. There must be another path. There is a calling, but no one answers. There is seeking, but there's no path. There's wanting guidance, but there's no teacher.

And then there's also being born without a sufficient mental or physical capacity, we might even say psychological capacity, to hear, to learn, to actually be able to practice the Dharma. The Dharma practice is not about physical prowess or high intelligence, but it is very much a body-mind practice. And so it does require a certain degree of sufficiency, of ability within the body, within the mind, to hear the Dharma, to understand the teachings, to be able to reflect, to take a posture of meditation.

Most of us have encountered these realms—people living in these realms, maybe close up, maybe far away, maybe some of us have been such a person at different times. All of us have, you know, at least driven through these realms, gotten out, had a meal there, bought some clothing, tried them on, tasted a bit. When they're entrenched and ongoing, then the conditions for encountering Buddhadharma become more and more slight. Right? That's what it's basically saying. It's like, I mean, if you could separate the person from the realm—which, of course, you can't, because karmically the person, in one way of understanding, the person has created this realm for themselves. Another way of understanding is sometimes people are born into or thrust into a realm not of their choosing, not because of their actions, but in them. The possibility of practicing becomes harder and harder.

When those realms are occasional, then they can actually be strong, in a sense, negative examples of how not to live. I remember when I was young, I started working when I was young and then worked all the way through the latter part of grade school and then through high school. And, you know, I was a kid, so I had kids' jobs. So if I was in a restaurant, I worked in a laundromat, I was always in the back room, you know, I was never in the front. I mean, who's going to put a kid in the front? So I was in the back, but with adults. And these were adults from all walks of life, all kinds of socioeconomic backgrounds and realities, living in different worlds, worlds different than mine. And it was an incredible education. I met people that I, you know, didn't come across in my neighborhood, didn't go to school with, got to know some of them, heard some of their stories. And it was really the first time where I began thinking about, what is this life like? What is this like? It seems difficult.

But then, of course, there are favorable conditions, right? That's what you've been waiting for, right? To be born as a human being. Being born as a human being is considered most favorable because we live long enough to experience adversity and suffering, right? And to raise bodhicitta. But we don't live so long that we can put it off forever. And so we have this sufficient amount of time, if we're fortunate, right? If we live long enough to have enough life experiences that we realize, okay, this is not going the way I wanted, hoped, thought, can raise bodhicitta, can seek, but we have to. But everything is impermanent. So we have to, like, respond, answer the call.

We need to be born in a place where the Dharma is actually present, it's alive. To have been born at a time when a Buddha was born and taught and those teachings are still available. We need to have sufficient faculties in our body and mind, again, so that we can hear, sit, study, reflect. We need to have lived a sufficiently positive life, healthy life, a sufficiently decent life—decent in the sense of not creating so much trouble—that our karma has been fortuitous enough, fortunate enough, positive enough, that we have found our way to the Dharma.

But again, none of these are absolutes. And I've met people who, by their own admission, had never committed one unselfish act in their life. I'm thinking of particularly people I got to know when I was doing a lot of prison work. I remember one, in dokusan, one student, telling me this. And I knew him, and he was quite a wonderful person, I thought. And he came and he confessed that. I said, ""Come on."" He said, ""No, I'm telling you, I've never done anything in my life that was not about me. It was not putting me first."" I've heard from people who said that they were in a hell realm in which there was no escape. And then a shard of light passed through, and they began to think and wonder and question.

But generally speaking, to have lived a good enough life that we are creating positive karma—not only to be able to find a way to the Dharma, but so that when we encounter the Dharma, the burdens that we all carry from our past karma and the lives we've lived are not so heavy, so intractable, that we can't engage a sufficient amount of faith and trust and confidence to be able to trust the teachings when we encounter them. Right? If we don't have a sufficient amount of trust in the teachings, we can't hear them—they're not teachings for us—to be able to trust our teacher, our teachers from whom we hear the Dharma. Again, if we don't trust them, then why would we listen to them? Why would we take to heart what they say?

We need to have enough faith, right? 1% to start. Enough so that when we encounter the Dharma, we don't just turn around and walk away. We stay. We linger. We listen. Maybe we stay a little bit longer. Maybe we take a step forward. So, for the professional cynic or skeptic or doomsdayer, practice is going to be very, very tough. The doors seem to be closed, right?

And so, again, some of these things we can't change. We can't—if we've been born in a time when there's no Buddha, there's not much we can do about that, unless you are that person. We can encounter other things, of course. We can't encounter Bodhidharma. So, no unfavorable condition needs to be completely absent, and no favorable condition needs to be completely present. That's good news, right? So it puts us pretty squarely in a good place. This is a good news talk, if you didn't get that.

Shantideva, in his book, in his teaching on the Bodhisattva, says, ""I join my hands and pray to Buddhas who reside in every quarter. Kindle now the Dharma's light for those who grow bewildered in the dark of suffering."" So there's asking, a beseeching: please, I know you're here, right? Kindle the Dharma light, right? What if the Buddha, after his enlightenment and the reflection after some days over what he had experienced, and then his discernment—should I teach? People are too cherishing of their habits, their attachments, their views. It's just not going to go well. And then the gods or some powerful person or some wandering person, somebody came and appealed to him and said, ""No, no, there are people who will hear this. There are people who are waiting to hear this."" And what if the Buddha said, ""I don't think so,"" and we never heard. And that was it. We're not here right now.

And so Shantideva is calling to that Buddha: ""I beseech the enlightened ones who wish to pass beyond the bonds of suffering—do not leave us in our ignorance, but stay among us for unnumbered ages."" Don't leave. Stay.

I was thinking about how in the very early years, when things were tough, finances particularly, and sometimes every once in a while, Daido would—if he felt like, I think we were being too, I don't know, not doing enough to make this place work and generate some income and programs and so on—he would say, quite seriously, ""I think maybe I should just go get a job driving a truck and earn some money."" And we were like, ""Please don't do that.""

To live in a time when a Buddha has appeared, to live in a time when a Buddha has taught, to live in a time when the teachings are still present and can be heard, to be able to encounter the practice and do the practice, to find a teacher, a sangha—we can take these things completely for granted. And the teachings are very clear: we should not, but rather actually appreciate how fortunate we are, right? Particularly in our culture, we've sort of had this ingrained presumption, these expectations of everything that we are deserving of, that we should have, and think everything we should not have—we shouldn't have suffering, we shouldn't have adversity, right? Things should be easy. I should be able to get what I want. It shouldn't cost too much. That's a pretty modern delusion.

And the teachings are very clear about this, both in helping us to not fall into that kind of complacency, but also to appreciate our good fortune, how fortunate we are. You know, we can spend, particularly during sesshin, we can spend a lot of time focusing on what is lacking—not enough mindfulness, not enough concentration, not enough energy, not enough whatever. And if we can just pause for a moment and realize, okay, that's just practice, that's not new. There's nothing unique about that. It feels unique to us. It can feel especially special, right? Our distraction, our entanglements, our struggles. And that's not to diminish or belittle the effect that they have on us. They hurt. But to step back a little bit and say, yes, and is there anyone who has not transgressed? Is there anyone who has not struggled? Is there anyone who's meditated and has not experienced this?

The liturgy, the teachings, every service we do, every meal we take is pointing not just to the teachings and to the practice of that particular moment, but our good fortune. The liturgy is constantly pointing to our good fortune, the fact that we can just simply do a service, that we can chant a sutra. ""Oh, yeah, the Heart Sutra. Yeah. Have you read it? Yeah, I've read it. What else have you read?"" That's why the teaching or the comment that some people, when they read the Heart Sutra, they have a heart attack. Why would they have a heart attack? Because they take it seriously. And they realize, oh my god, is this possible?

You have the good fortune to be sitting on this cushion, as do I, in the posture of a Buddha, to meet your mind. I remember years ago, we did a retreat on ethics in business, medicine or science, and one other thing—I don't remember. And for business, we had a silent partner from Ben & Jerry's, before it got bought out, when they were really about doing social service, social action. And he was talking about some of the plans they'd had. They were going to have an adopt-a-subway thing, you know, like adopt-a-highway, but in New York City. Adopt a subway, but the unions just shut that right down. But one of the thoughts they had was, like, at these G8, G20 meetings with all the world leaders who are going to get together and decide things about us, that before they could start their meetings, they all had to have an ice cream cone. And it had to be in a cone, not a cup. Because when you eat an ice cream cone, what happens? Starts to melt, drips over your fingers. He said, ""You become a child. You become a child. You remember what it's like to be a child."" Everybody's sitting around the table, licking their fingers. ""Okay, now let's talk about what's going on."" Even better, after they've had their ice cream—to meet their mind, their mind, their biased mind, their unexamined mind, to meet the minds of others, to begin to examine karma, to take responsibility for past actions and the actions that are happening right now in this zendo, at that table, and to realize we can set those free. We can open our hearts beyond what we can even imagine, towards those that we cannot even imagine opening our hearts to, and that we can be of benefit in the world.

That's what the Buddha was saying in the sutra: When we practice, we make ourselves serviceable—our minds, our bodies, our emotions, our actions. This is how we express our gratitude. That's why it's so important that we have received these practices that have come down to us, that in every generation, in some generation, everybody got together and said, ""You know, Fusatsu, we don't really need that anymore."" That didn't happen. ""Zazen, you know, it's just hard. People don't really like it. We'd get many more people if we didn't do zazen."" And that we can do these practices and be changed by them. And what makes that possible to the greatest degree is when you do them with your whole body and mind, all throughout.

That's why it's so important to not become dull or dead to these practices that we do again and again. To continue alive in your mind, to continue, to start again, to continue. And none of us do that every time. None of us do, right? We are creatures of habit. And so these practices become habits. Don't let that run away.

When I'm officiating a service and I realize that I have gotten lost, I feel bad. I do. For that moment. I don't, you know, put a hair shirt on, but I feel bad. Not only did I miss something, but I missed something, right? So I'm not suggesting you feel bad, but that we take it seriously. Shugen talked yesterday about sincerity. That's what makes us work it.

Thanks so much for listening.

All right. So what is the work of this moment? We could say it's to look deeply underneath the appearance of things. We could say that what we find comes in glimmers that clarify over time. We could say that our experience, our understanding of the Dharma, happens gradually by virtue of training. We say that the great matter is beyond words, that it's outside the scriptures, and yet it does get talked about in various ways. We have to hush the baby's cry.

So we might say the way is perfect, like vast space. We might say the entire phenomenal world is the magical display of the deity. We might speak of Tathagata, the realm of reality, the Dharma body, Nirvana, the deathless, the unborn mind, the world, Vairocana Buddha.

Master Kazan in Zazen Yojinki, an essay on the practice of Zazen, wrote:
What is this? Its name is unknown. It cannot be called body. It cannot be called mind. Trying to think of it, the thought vanishes. Trying to speak of it, words die. It is like a fool, an idiot. It is as high as a mountain, deep as the ocean, without peak or depths. Its brilliance is unthinkable. It shows itself silently between sky and earth. Only this whole body is seen.

Dogen said to take up a leaf and transform it into the sixteen-foot golden body of the Buddha, to take up the sixteen-foot golden body of the Buddha and turn it into a lettuce leaf.

I have explored now and again a little bit, just a little bit, of Vajrayana meditation practice. And one thing that I've only explored the tiniest bit is this notion of deity practice, where you work with and cultivate an image of the deity and relate to that within your meditation, and bring that deity into your own being, becoming that deity. And I've explored it not as a Vajrayana practitioner would, but as a student of mind and meditation might. And I think it's very interesting from that perspective that there's an approach of starting with the deity and bringing it in, and then seeing the entire phenomenal world as the display of the deity.

And then the Zen approach, which is to start with the phenomenal world—with the lettuce leaf, with the shovel full of gravel, with the shit stick—and to go in that route and discover the entire phenomenal world is no other than the world-honored one. And by ""entire phenomenal world,"" don't mistake who I'm talking about.

In the Pabhassara Sutta, Buddha said:
Luminous, monks, is the mind, and it is defiled by incoming defilements. The uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person doesn't discern that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that for the uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person, there is no development of the mind. Luminous, monks, is the mind, and it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present, discerns that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones, there is development of the mind.

The well-instructed disciples of the noble ones—how did we get to be so lucky? I don't know. For the well-instructed disciples of the noble ones, there is development of the mind. And as a friend of mine in the Dharma has said on several occasions, we go in the direction we're pointed. So, beyond words and letters, outside the scriptures, and yet there is pointing, and we do turn ourselves and head this development of mind.

We speak about the threefold training of sila, samadhi, and prajna, so commonly thought of as morality (sila), samadhi as meditative concentration, prajna as wisdom. And the Buddha's Eightfold Path can be looked at through this lens of the threefold training. So, with sila, the moral conduct, you have right speech, right action, right livelihood. With samadhi or concentration, that's right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. And then prajna or wisdom is right view and also right intention or right resolve.

And what I wanted to do is look at the threefold training as some energetic pointers that might be beneficial for us as we continue to deepen into sesshin, more like a flavor or an energy or attitude we could cultivate or call forward, or if we're getting lost or, I don't know, stuck, we might find use for sila.

I was thinking about, what is the energy of sila, the teaching on purification of the mind, ceasing from harm, practicing good, actualizing good for others, the three pure precepts that sort of hold the whole thing. And I thought, you know, sincerity. Sincerity. Caring. The energy of caring. The Latin root of the word sincerity means clean and pure. I was so pleased to look that up and find that—caring, sincerity.

I feel like sincerity and commitment are like two of the beautiful human qualities on which the monastery is built, on which it runs. It's like you kind of have to have sincerity to train. Everybody's sincerity can look different. It doesn't have to show up in a particular way. But I'm guessing that for each of us, it's present—caring, caring, caring about practice, caring about our life, caring about the great matter, the world, living beings. It's the quality in our own heart that wants to know, wants to understand.

I remember once, years ago, in an open sozan, Shoka was the head server—for those of you who know Shoka. And he spoke about how he felt so grateful to have the opportunity to be head server, and that a position like that—and I think he was speaking very personally, but in a sense also more broadly—gives you permission to care. And that really struck me. It stayed with me all these years because sometimes in our culture it seems like, I don't know, the encouragement is to not really give a shit. But isn't caring incredible? Caring about how you do a thing, or caring about a person, caring about a sangha or a monastery? That sincerity.

That sincerity is one way that we can respond to the wounds of the world, isn't it? Like, we can let the wounds of the world, the wounds the world brings to us, or the wounds that we witness in the world—of course, ultimately, where can you draw the line?—we can let them harden, we can let them encourage a strong sort of defense, or we can let them help us care. It's more painful to care. Maybe not, though, right? It seems that way, but there's something else there—the possibility of joy, the reality of love.

What else do you want in your life than love? Aren't you willing to hurt some for the sake of love?

In the precepts retreat that I had the honor and pleasure of co-leading with Shugen Roshi a couple weeks ago, we were talking about, like, when do you know if you are aligned with good? Or like, when do you know that, when your moral alignment is true? Which is a great question to consider. And people had some thoughtful responses. And a common theme that emerged was, like, it's a feeling. It's a feeling. It's kind of one of those things that, like, we can put some words there and we can put some labels there, but what we're talking about is like a heart feeling.

We know when we've done something harmful. God, don't you just feel it when you've hurt somebody? And, you know, we can feel it when we atone, when we repair, when harmony is restored. Isn't this interesting that it's a feeling? Hmm. Does that make you wonder? The livingness of things. We feel it. The livingness of things, the living world, the live world, the phenomenal world as the sixteen-foot golden body of the Buddha.

I've told this story before, but it's a good one, and I know there's some newer folks, so I'm going to tell it again. Many years ago, when I was in my first year of residency and I was in the kitchen, I was the cook with Emmy Stanley—for you old timers who remember Emmy—we were in the kitchen, and one afternoon, one summer afternoon, one of the residents, who was having a rough time and who had a volatile character, just generally speaking, was really upset about something, I don't know what, and he stormed into the kitchen and was speaking loudly, sort of yelling around, and he opened the refrigerator door and slammed it, and then he kicked the refrigerator, and then he stormed out of the kitchen.

And, you know, it's the monastery—like, that does not happen all the time. So Emmy and I were both, like, a little rattled and, like, shaken up. And I don't know that we waited too long before we went to check in with the Tenzo, who at that time was Shugen Roshi in the adjoining office. And we went in and we're, like, trying to sort of, like, report what happened. And Shugen took a breath and he was like, ""He shouldn't do that. The refrigerator is a sentient being.""

That's not what I expected. That's not what I expected. And I took it in, and I think we probably talked some more. I don't remember anything else of that conversation about what to do and da, da, da, da, da. And anyway, the initial activation felt calmed, discharged. And, like, Emmy and I went back into the kitchen to finish making supper.

And later I was thinking about this, and I had to know, what does this mean? And I went back to Shugen and I asked, ""What did you mean by that, that the refrigerator's a sentient being?"" And he said, ""You know that rock that you and Emmy like to go and sit on in the river?"" We used to go during our breaks down to the river. And I said, ""Yeah."" And he said, ""Well, how would you feel if one day you went there and it was covered with graffiti and someone had left trash all over it?"" Okay, you with me? That was the answer.

A living world. A living world. And sometimes it does feel like our dominant American culture is behaving like it's a dead world. So that's painful. If you care, that is painful. A little sincerity, a lot of sincerity—practice seems to, I think, nurture sincerity.

There's a story of how a student asked Yasutani Roshi, ""You know, Roshi, you speak about how important sincerity is for practice. How much sincerity does a person need? You know, is it like 75%, is that enough sincerity? Or is, like, 85%, 90%—like, how much sincerity is enough?"" And Yasutani Roshi said, ""I think 1%. 1% sincerity is enough.""

At the end of oryoki, we chant, ""May we exist in muddy water with purity, like a lotus."" So how do we do that?

Samadhi. If sila is the energy of sincerity or caring, samadhi is the energy of steady presence, attention, steady. And this quality of steady attention mixes so potently with sincerity. Things can really happen. I think a lot about the simplicity of the Zen instruction and the simplicity of the form and the emphasis of the form—like, that's a big part of how we train. And people will encounter that, and I think from the beginner's sort of standpoint, it can seem austere, it can seem heavy-handed, it can seem like, wow, there's a really big emphasis on discipline. Like, what about the other important qualities, right? And it can take a while before we start to see, like, what is being offered in all that form. Do it this way, not like this. It's like you have to stick around. You have to stick around.

And so I think it is really good—I feel like over the years we, meaning the training staff, have been learning how to be skillful, more skillful, I hope, in terms of offering the form and holding the discipline. But I guess what I want to say is, like, those instructions—trust them. That's where the sincerity can really help and commingle.

I was thinking again—this is like another memory from long ago, wandering down memory lane—I remember I was like, it was probably sesshin during my first year of residence and my mind was super scattered. And I think that, like, people should appreciate, first of all, just, like, how hard the cooks work and how cooking for sesshin is its own unique practice because you don't really get to sort of finish caretaking, wrap it up and forget about it until tomorrow. There's meal after meal and the cooks are doing things in between. And I remember being in that position and really finding it hard to settle my mind. And again, talking to Shugen and he said—I was, oh, it was oryoki. I guess maybe oryoki was really bringing up my fixations because I'd been, like, part of preparing the meal or something. But I was really, like, going to town in oryoki. I couldn't focus. And he was like, ""Well, one thing that could help is to just really pay attention to where your hands are."" And at the time I thought, like, that is such a weird instruction. Like, what does that even mean? You know? And, like, he was like, ""Because, you know, you're always doing things with your hands in oryoki."" And from the vantage point in which I was, I just thought, like, I don't really get it. Like, what does that have to do with, you know, seeing my true nature?

But sincerity—I tried to take it up and I could see, okay, there's a calming effect. I needed to know where to rest my attention, right? Samadhi, that continuity of presence has to have a clarity about what we're being present to. That's part of its skillfulness. So when you have a practice, you know, sometimes the monitors will say, like, ""Remember what your practice is."" And we might be sitting there and being like, ""Oh, yeah, right. Whoops."" We have to—our mind needs to know, like, okay, my practice is the breath, or my practice is shikantaza, or my practice is mu. And then that's what we're returning to. And that helps that really active mind, that distracted mind, calm.

And so when we're given the forms of sesshin, where everything is really stripped down and we're given this instruction to, like, be present with what is, that is potent instruction. To the degree that you're able to engage it, I hope that you have discovered just how potent it is.

Master Hongren, who's the fifth ancestor of Zen, Chinese ancestor, says:
There is an indestructible Buddha nature in the bodies of living beings. Like the orb of the sun, its body luminous, round and full, vast and boundless. The pure mind of all living beings is like this, merely covered up by the dark clouds of obsession with objects, arbitrary thoughts, psychological afflictions and views and opinions. If you can just keep the mind still so that errant thought does not arise, the reality of Nirvana will naturally appear. This is how we know the inherent mind is originally pure.

And I would say, you know, having worked a lot over the years with instructions on keeping the mind still and not letting a thought arise, that I have found it to be more beneficial and more skillful to understand that you're just practicing a very, very discerning awareness that gets more and more refined, and thoughts may cease to arise, but it doesn't really matter as long as you're recognizing what the mind is doing and recognizing that brightly. Right? So there's a difference between getting carried away by a thought and having it lead and sort of spin and create a whole world, and recognizing a thought as it arises and seeing that just within that recognition itself, there's the possibility—and in a sense, really, if we're practicing, the inevitability—that then that thought will dissolve. And we can see and feel the mind doesn't necessarily want it to dissolve. The mind will pursue sometimes.

So this is where that steady presence, that quality, that energetic quality of samadhi is so important. You can also think in terms of, like, there's the sense of, like, okay, well, I'm going to take my attention and put it on the breath and, like, keep it there. And there's also, like, I'm going to take my attention and put it on the breath and keep it there, but really my practice is going to be each time that I wander off, seeing that and coming back. It's a slightly different emphasis, but I found it helpful. It's, you know, so that the practice is then like, ""Oh, right. Not that—this."" You can see if it's helpful for you.

Also, I think helpful to notice that the continuity of attention, that kind of presence, is sensitive. Right? If we're going to be able to see the flickering of thought movement, we need to be sensitive, which means we need to be a certain kind of relaxed, a certain kind of receptive, this luminous mind that's aware and awake. It doesn't have to be treated like a, I don't know, you know, like a sealed container—let's keep everything out. It doesn't have to be like that, as long as you're awake. And that quality of sincerity, again, that can bring forward a nice underlying energy as we're cultivating samadhi. That we care. That we care and that we care deeply enough when the thoughts come and they start going. And we love our thoughts. We love our thoughts, right? It's so interesting. It's not actually, but, like, we think it's so interesting. That's the nature of our sort of karmic mind. It seems so engaging. And so it's helpful, I think, to have that deeper caring to remind us, like, okay, no, this is not the time for that.

So, prajna—wisdom. The energy of prajna: allowing space. This runs so counter to how our mind typically engages with things—very dense and kind of claustrophobic. And if we're looking at our mind, we see, oh, so much activity and so much grasping and so many projections and so many shadows. And I think I came across this teaching by Andy Carr in a book called ""Contemplating Reality."" And it's a good book. And he has this section where he's talking about how our mind—basically, how projection sort of works. I don't want to get too into it, it's a little dense. Let me see if I can just pull out the juicy bits for the moment.

I mean, basically, he says, like, okay, so he's defining some terms to make a larger point. But he talks about, like, okay, so if you think now about the tall buildings in New York City, an image of those tall buildings will appear in your mind. But this is a generalized—the term he's defining is generally characterized phenomena. So for our purposes, just to note that, like, okay, yeah, we can call, we can sort of call those tall buildings in the city to mind. We do this all the time, right? You can call your mother to mind or your childhood pet, and something will come to mind. Amazing, totally magical. And it's just your thought projection, right? Like, it's not actually those tall buildings. It's not actually your mother, it's not actually your childhood pet. It's your sort of, like, thought, feeling, image, memory, like, gestalt-ish thing. And he calls it—this would be the generally characterized phenomena, which is a referent for the—sorry, specifically characterized phenomena.

But we get confused all the time. And we think that that, like, gestalt-ish, feeling, image, mental formation of a person, a place, or a thing is the thing. It's totally not the thing. And then we spend our lives in this world of all of these generally characterized phenomena, thinking that they're actual. And we are. Andy Carr says, ""Here is the basic point: We spend a great deal of time thinking about things, but that thinking is mistaken.""

So what happens when it's not the generally characterized phenomena? What happens when we actually encounter a thing as it is?

Master Mazu: The mind can be spoken of in terms of its two: birth and death—ordinary, sort of conventional, I should say—and suchness. Mind as suchness is like a clear mirror which can reflect images. The mirror symbolizes the mind, the images symbolize the dharmas. If the mind grasps at dharmas, then it gets involved in external causes and conditions, which is the meaning of birth and death. If the mind does not grasp at dharmas, that is suchness.

Okay, bringing forth that quality of steady presence and allowing some space, not grasping, then the sacred living world can fully bloom. The Dharma of thusness has been intimately conveyed by Buddhas and ancestors. This is the wisdom teaching.

I've noticed lately that if I am speaking to myself, I can call myself ""beloved."" And it helps. ""Beloved, it's okay. I'm sure you're gonna pull your talk together just fine."" You could try that too. ""Beloved, hang in there.""

Master Hongzhi says: Contact phenomena with total sincerity. Not a single atom of dust outside yourself.

I like that one. It feels like it hits all the notes. Contact phenomena—that's your samadhi presence. Steady contact—with total sincerity, that's your sila. Not a single atom of dust outside yourself, that's your prajna. And on the way to prajna, we have so many glimmers: wonder, curiosity, tenderness, ease. We need all of this so much. It will serve us so well. It will serve the world. We need this connection to the deep truth, the sacred life.

I've been feeling buoyed, grateful, inspired by some words that Van Jones offered—the political analyst, green jobs advisor in the Obama administration. He said, ""Then there is this particular kind of theology that is native to the black church, what I call 'Hallelujah Anyhow theology.' Shit's going wrong. Things are crazy. It's bad. Mmm, that blue sky. Oh, those robins."" I talked to a friend recently, said, ""How are you dealing with all of this?"" She said, ""I am defiant. They can't have my mind. Hallelujah anyhow.""

I'll end with the poem by Joy Harjo:

Praise the rain.
Praise the rain, the seagull dive, the curl of plant, the raven talk.
Praise the hurt, the house slack, the stand of trees, the dignity.
Praise the dark, the moon cradle, the sky fall, the bear asleep.
Praise the mist, the warrior name, the earth eclipse, the fired leap.
Praise the backwards, upward sky, the baby cry, the spirit food.
Praise canoe, the fish rush, the hole for frog, the upside down.
Praise the day, the cloud cup, the mind flat, forget it all.
Praise crazy. Praise sad. Praise the path on which we're led.
Praise the roads on earth and water.
Praise the eater and the eaten.
Praise beginnings. Praise the end.
Praise the song. Praise the singer.
Praise the rain. It brings more rain.
Praise the rain, it brings more rain.

And Rumi:
We are the mirror as well as the face in it.
We are tasting the taste this minute.
We are pain and what cures pain, both.
We are the sweet cold water and the jug that pours.

Let's use this ripe, rich time in sesshin. May it be for the benefit of all beings through space and time.

This is from the Book of Serenity, Baizhang's Fox Pointer:

If you keep so much as the letter A in your mind, you go to hell. Like an arrow shot—one drop of wild fox slobber, when swallowed, cannot be spit out for 30 years. It's not that the order is strict in India; it's just that the ignoramus' karma is heavy. Has there ever been anyone who mistakenly transgressed?

**Main Case**

When Master Baizhang lectured in the hall, there was always an old priest who listened to the teaching and then dispersed with the crowd. One day, they didn't leave. Baizhang asked them, ""Who is this standing here before me?"" 

The old priest said, ""In ancient times, in the time of the ancient Buddha Kashyapa, I lived on this mountain. As a former abbot, a student once asked, 'Does a greatly cultivated person still fall into cause and effect, or not?' I answered them, 'They do not fall into cause and effect.' And I fell into a wild fox body for 500 lives. Now I ask the teacher to turn a word in my behalf.""

Master Baizhang said, ""The greatly cultivated person is not blind to cause and effect."" At this, the old priest was greatly enlightened.

**The Verse**

A foot of water, a fathom of wave.  
For 500 years, 500 lives couldn't do a thing.  
Not falling, not blind.  
They haggle as before entering a nest of complications. Aha.  
Understand—if you are clear and free, there is no objection to my babble.  
The spirit songs and shrine dances spontaneously form a harmony,  
Clapping in the intervals, singing lila—who doesn't love a good story?

This koan is also in the Mumonkan. The second case, and the way we do it, is that the student, after working with Mu in the miscellaneous koans, goes to the Mumonkan and skips this koan, does all the rest in the collection, and then at the very end comes back to this. Because it's important, and it's not so easy. It's dealt with in the Mumonkan, as is characteristic of the Gateless Gate, kind of bluntly. Here there's a little bit more eloquence.

So, ""If you keep so much as the letter A in your mind, you'll go to hell like an arrow shot."" So on this path of non-attachment, keep even the letter A. How do we shift? How do we shift? Another way of asking that is: What do each of us preserve? What are the things that we want to let go of, are eager to let go of? What are the things we don't want to—things still cherished, the things we still believe in, that we believe, if only, that they will give, that they will last, they will take away?

I think non-attachment—or attachments—is one of those really key aspects of Buddhism which is so easy to misunderstand, what it actually is. Think of it as denying, of losing, of extinguishing. ""It's not that the order is strict in India. It's just that the deluded ones' karma is heavy."" Karma is heavy, which means what we carry is heavy. It's binding. It's like a drag, it's like a cloud. It can seem to carry us, to drag us along. It can almost certainly seem to be oneself. 

We can carry it without knowing. We can carry it because we think we deserve to, it's our punishment. We can carry it because we can misunderstand letting go to mean forgetting, or somehow being irresponsible or not caring. And in carrying it for more than a moment—let alone year after year—it is our sense of self. Not in full, but it is something we identify with. And in that way, to not carry it, to shift, is not only unfamiliar, it can be frightening. Like, actually frightening. Not poetically, metaphorically, but actually frightening enough that we go back and pick that burden up again. If we do not carry it, then who am I then?

And so the effects of the karmic actions we carry—what we've created, what we've experienced from others and have integrated, acted upon, created our own karma as a result of—for many of us, is what brings us to the Dharma, right? Nobody comes to practice because you're having too good a time in this life. Everything is going so perfectly, getting everything you want.

Has there ever been anyone who mistakenly transgressed? Has there ever been anyone who has not transgressed? Are there things you regret? I'm going to guess the answer to that is yes.

So what do we do about all that? It's a really essential question if we are trying to not only lighten our burden and not accumulate—because burdens do accumulate, they don't stay neat and tucked. They don't weigh in at one weight and keep that weight through the course of our life. They gain weight. So how do we free ourselves? If you keep so much as the letter A in your mind, it's easy to say, well, just let it go. And that's really good instruction. And it's true, and it's exactly what we need to be doing. But if that's so, then why aren't we all immediately free as soon as we get that instruction?

And so in this koan, there's more to it. In the Mumonkan, after the priest is enlightened, they ask Baizhang to do the favor and say, ""There's a fox's body in a cave on the mountain. Would you please bury it with full ceremony?"" So Baizhang gets a bunch of the monastics. They go, they find the fox, pull it out of its cave, bring it down, call everyone together for a funeral. And the monks are like, ""For who? Nobody's died."" And so they have this whole elaborate ceremony for this fox. And then that night, he and Huangbo, his disciple, have an interesting conversation. I'll get to that later in the week.

When Daido Roshi would give this koan, sometimes he would say that he imagined Baizhang had been wandering in the mountains, had come across a dead fox, pushed it back into a cave, and then come down and rolled this whole story out. Haven't you all noticed this old priest who comes? ""No, I haven't seen it."" ""Yeah, every talk, he's back there, then leaves.""

And so the priest comes to Baizhang. Baizhang says, ""Who are you? You keep coming to the talks and then disappearing."" He says, ""In former times, I was the former abbot of this monastery. And one day a student asked, as an enlightened being, as a highly cultivated person, fall into causation or not?"" And they answered according to the teachings, ""No, they do not."" And for that, they were made to live as a fox for 500 lives, which is not a good thing.

Does a greatly cultivated person still fall into causation? And the footnote to that says, ""Just do good. Don't ask about the road ahead."" That is also very good instruction. Just do good. Don't worry about what happens next. Just live in accord with the Dharma, cease from creating harm, live in accordance with your basic nature, and be a benefit. Don't worry about what happens next. I think of Atisha's phrase, ""Don't expect applause, just do good.""

So the old priest said, ""Enlightened being does not fall into causation, has freed himself."" The Buddha, upon his enlightenment, said, ""I will not return. The house builder will not build this house again."" Buddhism teaches that we return because karma is continuing. We are still a result of the forces of karmic actions. And so this enlightened being, the Buddha, does not fall back into causation, does not come back again. So the old man was—the old priest was answering, and it's just that way.

So then why were they made to live as a fox for 500 years? 500 lives? Quite a number of teachers have commented on this koan, which is always an indication that it was of interest. Dogen says students do not understand the principle of causation and mistakenly deny cause and effect. What a pity. Things are deteriorating and the ancestral way has degenerated. Those who say ""does not fall into cause and effect"" deny causation, thereby falling into the lower realms. Those who say ""does not ignore cause and effect"" clearly identify with or have deep faith in cause and effect. When people hear about identifying with cause and effect, they are freed from the lower realms. Do not try to get away from this. Do not doubt this.

Without that deep faith—and Dogen is emphatic, and he's just teaching in accord with what began with the Buddha—but without that deep faith, I mean, think about it. We might think that our actions have no consequences. There have been schools of thought that believe that, that everything just happens in some sort of random or not causal way, or that actions don't matter—not having faith in cause and effect, or that we can avoid the consequences, fly below the radar, get away with it.

And so, deep faith in causation, really trusting it in a way, is helping us to see that everything we do has influence. Every action, every intentional action in Buddhism, has an effect, because every action has an effect. But the intentional actions are the ones that Buddhism is really concerned about, because that's where we're creating karma, arising out of whatever we're holding on to, whatever we believe, and how we create and perpetuate dukkha.

And so a faith in Buddhism that is, you know, in the early years, to talk about faith took a lot of qualifying because people—everybody, so many people being new to Buddhism—just assumed that faith was either faith in a higher being like God, or that it was somehow blind faith. You know, the Buddha said so, just believe it, even though that's explicitly not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha was very clear about the importance of having some faith, some trust enough to practice, but then verifying. Having faith in causation helps us to understand that we have influence, and that influence can go in a lot of different directions, right? We can do a lot of good. We can do a whole lot of harm.

I think, in a very real sense, deep faith gives us the confidence to just do good. We don't have to chart our actions on a grid. We don't have to act and then measure its effect. Just do good. Because there's faith in cause and effect. Doing good is good in its own right. And so we don't have to be bodhisattvas on the path that are always looking for rewards or treats or gold stars.

But the question remains: how can we be free? Because we have created karma, we still create karma. I'm imagining that all of us do carry regrets, things that we really, that I really wished I had not done, but I did. Perhaps you did. We cannot go back. And this is the path of going forward. It's a path. So how do we go forward with that? Is freedom just minimizing our negative actions? Just arriving at a place of perfect behavior, perfect speech, perfect thoughts? Is it like a matter of just being hyper alert, right? Sort of staying in the shadows so you never do anything that might go awry?

If realizing the nature of mind, the true nature of reality, is as the Buddha taught, ultimate liberation, then what is it that is realized? Well, it's the nature of the self. It's the nature of phenomena. But how does that free us of cause and effect? Or what do we realize about cause and effect?

So this priest said, ""The enlightened being does not fall into causation."" The footnote says, ""A fitting statement is a stake to tie a donkey to for 10,000 years."" In other words, it's fixing something. It's a definitive statement. And being so tethered, you can't move freely.

So what is the priest's mistake? I mean, think about if you did not believe in cause and effect, how would the world look to you? If your actions didn't have consequence, what would the world look like to you?

In Daido Roshi's The Eight Gates, in the chapter on Right Action—which is really the chapter on the precepts—he talks about how at that time, so this is going back, I think it was 1990 when it was published, around then. Because he talks about for 10 years we have been—so for 10 years we were here. And he talks about how in Western Dharma that the idea, particularly in Zen, that Zen is sort of beyond morality, that morality is of the relative world, but Zen realizes the absolute nature and is beyond morality. And so he's very emphatic about that being not true. And that's an issue, you could say, that's been part of Buddhism since the beginning, where there were schools of practitioners who believe that there is no cause and effect, or where people misunderstood selflessness as meaning that there is no consequence to our actions.

Dogen quotes Kumarata, Indian ancestor, who said, ""We see both wholesome and unwholesome results occurring in the world throughout time. People acting well, people not acting well. Ordinary folks deny cause and effect when they see kind and fair-minded people suffer and die young, while those who are violent and unjust prosper into old age. Such ordinary folks say neither crime nor beneficial acts bring consequences. Doesn't matter."" They do not realize that the consequences of our actions follow us for 100, 1,000, or 10,000 eons.

So this is the teaching of Buddhism—that's the deep faith, is that there is never not cause and effect, and that sometimes that effect appears quickly, sometimes it takes longer, sometimes it takes so long that we don't see it, we don't recognize the effect of this particular action. But what the Buddha taught—and the Buddha was said to have, because of the depth of his enlightenment, was able to see into all of the profound complexities and subtleties of causation and thus was able to say that there is no intentional action that does not bring forth a consequence. There again, just do good, don't worry about, don't get hung up on the road ahead.

And so, but what Kumarata is saying is natural. I mean, probably in every generation of human life and experience, people have wondered this, right? They've lived their lives and they've looked over here and they've seen this person or these people acting like hell beings and reaping lots of rewards, seeming to get all the good stuff, perhaps with impunity. And they see other fair-minded, kind, good people over here who are suffering, and life just seems to keep dealing them bad hands. How to make sense of it? Because of course then that can lead a person to think, well, what difference does it make if I lead a good life or not? If they don't have sort of an inner moral ground, it's like, why bother living well, right? If I'm not going to get some reward, if the consequences of that are not going to benefit me, why don't I just try and get away with everything I can?

What gives weight to our actions? What is that burden? Those burdens that we carry—because we probably have more than one? What gives our burdens their weight, these karmic burdens? Does it come from the original action itself and somehow the life of that action which happens and then is gone, but somehow lives on in us? Is it the action itself? If the action itself has a certain weight inherently, then everybody would suffer the same consequence. If it was something positive, then everyone would equally be uplifted, be joyful, be happy, be inspired. But that's not what we see.

You know, it's like here in the zendo during sesshin, the monitor or teacher can offer encouraging words. For one person, it's inspiring. It wakes them up, it brings them back to their practice, it's invigorating. And the other person may feel annoyed, irritated or insecure, feel left out—""they're not talking to me."" Does it come from the one who acts? Is it just from the side of the one who receives? What is the weight? We experience it internally. I talked about this recently in this body-mind. But where exactly? We can't deny that I'm experiencing it. That's how I know that I'm feeling something, carrying something, being bound by something. But where is it exactly? And what is it exactly? Does it have a certain size? A certain shape? Does it live in a certain part of me? Is it in my heart? Is it in my chest? Is it in my gut?

All dharmas are forms of emptiness. But then why was the former abbot turned into a fox? Dogen says, quoting Nagarjuna, ""If you deny cause and effect in the worldly realm, as some people outside the Way do, you negate this present life as well as future lives. If you deny cause and effect in the realm of practice, you reject the Three Treasures and the Four Noble Truths."" In other words, effectively, you can't practice.

I mean, think about the whole of practice, the whole of sesshin—not the whole of it, but a significant part, and certainly a significant part of what motivates us is the faith that if I understand, develop an understanding that is accurate about this body-mind, about myself, about my actions, about everything that constitutes itself, about the world, about you, each other, about time, about the nature of things, that if I develop a good understanding, and then I practice in accord with that understanding, that I will be moving more and more in a trustworthy way, into accord with everything. Because I'm practicing living in accord with everything. So if I'm doing that, I should experience that, right? There should be signs that that is happening, just as when I'm not doing that, I'm living against—not in harmony, in conflict with—there are certainly signs that that is happening.

And so we rely on that, right? We trust that. And there's a tension there. Because on the one hand, just do good. Don't look for the road ahead. Just sit. Just do. This day, just do sesshin. Don't come in with a truckload of expectations and then be checking yourself. ""Okay, what have you gained so far? What have you gained so far? What have you gained so far?"" Right? Because that's a cage and you'll know it. Because you'll be crying at some point.

At the same time, to be wholeheartedly practicing and after some reasonable amount of time, say, nothing has happened, there's been no change whatsoever. I have not seen any consequence to my actions. That bears further investigation. So there's a tension.

Dogen says, ""Clearly know that those who deny cause and effect are outside the Way, whether they're living a life as a home dweller or renunciant. They say that the present life is unreal, empty, and that their transient body, empty, is in this world, but that their true nature abides in enlightenment—'I'm in the world, but not of it. I see all of you from my lofty place. I'm sorry.' They believe that their true nature is mind, that mind and body are separate. But those who have studied deeply with true teachers should abandon mistaken views which deny causation, have faith in and pay respect to the compassionate teaching of our ancestor Nagarjuna.""

So this drumbeat of having faith in causation—not just, you know, it's a good idea, keep that in mind—but like, keep it in mind, examine it, study it, observe it. Now come closer. Look more deeply. What is the nature of cause and effect? How can we free ourselves if we cannot undo what has been done? How can we free ourselves?

And from a more traditional perspective, if what I am carrying is the result of an infinite number of lifetimes in which, in many of those lifetimes, I was not a good person—I was causing all kinds of chaos and riot. Remember a few years ago, I think it was during COVID, when Pema Chödrön did a retreat, I think it was an online retreat, and she was talking about death. And she said, you know, if you find yourself getting really freaked out or worried or obsessed or frightened about death, she said, ""Just remember, you have died countless thousands, hundreds of thousands of times, and in some really miserable ways. So keep it in perspective. This is just one."" 

How do we free ourselves? What is it that bites us? The old priest said, ""An enlightened being does not fall into causation."" They have realized something about cause and effect. What is a cause? It's an action, something you do with your body. What is the nature of this body? Something you do with your words. What is the nature of the words—not their meaning, but their self-nature? Something you do with your thoughts. What is the nature of a thought? Well, one thing you already know is that each of those three wheels by which we create karma, change the world, are impermanent, right? Have you ever had a thought that never went away? Have you ever said something that, once you said it, it remained permanently in your mouth or in the ears of the hearer?

We'd like to think that our body is permanent. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know if that would actually be a good deal. Clearly, it's not. The intention that arises that brings forth that action—that comes and goes. The emotion that it might originate—the klesha, if it's a negative: ""I'm greedy, I'm acting out of that. I'm angry, I'm acting out of that""—that comes and goes. The consequence—I say something, you have a certain reaction—that comes and goes.

So where is the burden? What is the—because we can't deny. That's what these teachers are saying: Do not deny. Dogen says, ""Do not doubt this. Do not try and get away from this."" I mean, that's the basis for a kind of a seriously unwell person. And we may have some in high places who do not know the effect or do not care—they know that they have effect, but may not care of the consequences of those actions, which is, in a sense, like virtually denying.

If we didn't have faith in causation, who would practice Buddha Dharma? If there wasn't cause and effect, we wouldn't feel regret or remorse. There'd be no heartache, no worry. We wouldn't carry a burden. If there was no cause and effect, we could put our burden down. Or rather, what you could say about all of those would be: there would be nothing but regrets and no way to affect them. There would be no end to the heartache and no way to diminish them or free ourselves of them. There would be no end to burdens, and they would be permanently attached to us.

What is the true thing about all this? It's important because it's the basis upon which we're practicing. And having deep faith, as I said, is not just about a kind of theoretical faith in something called cause and effect. But if we really trust that and study it, practice it, observe it, examine it, that feeds directly into how we practice.

I mean, think about it. It gives us the ability, the confidence to keep going when your mind is very close to convincing you that you are completely wasting your time. Like, ""When are you going to get it?"" Or that everybody else here is perfectly suited to be a Buddha, but I'm sorry, you were like in the toilet, right, when they're giving out Buddha nature, right?

What keeps us going when it seems like it's not moving or it's insurmountable, or my attachments seem intractable, or my comparing mind is killing me because I just—I'm digging a hole and I'm digging it deeper and deeper and deeper and just throwing myself into it. Everybody else is fine, but I am going down. So it's quite important.

So is this old priest wrong? There's a miscellaneous koan that's in our tradition that says: In the Maha Prajna Paramita Sutra, expounded by Manjushri, it says, ""An ascetic who is pure and undefiled will not enter Nirvana, and a monastic who breaks the precepts will not fall into hell."" Now, that seems to directly contradict the teachings.

It's important to understand that that ascetic practices to purify their defilements, and they do not, in their impurity and their defilement, fall—well, they do not, in their purity and undefilement, enter Nirvana, and the monastic practices the precepts, and when they break, they will not fall into hell.

Is that contradicting the Buddha's teaching? That's why this is an important koan, because it's easy to—and one could read, if we didn't read it closely—the commentaries and it seems to be affirming, basically, just do good, don't worry about the rest. The priest answered wrongly, was made to live as a fox, that's pretty clear. Asked for a teaching, Baizhang responded, ""Does not ignore causation."" Released from the fox body, rewarded. That seems pretty clear. That's not untrue. But it's not enough, and it's not just a matter of not being—the real depth of this koan—but it's not enough for our lives. That alone will not be sufficient to free us.

Daido Roshi said, ""We encounter and practice the precepts initially on the basis of faith. They make sense, and we can bring them into our lives."" Hallelujah.

It takes years of practice and training—oh, I thought I was quoting him, these are actually my words because I wrote Daido Roshi and I thought, oh, I'm quoting him, then I realized, no, I'm remembering what he used to talk. Remember he told the story once that he was listening, when we started recording talks on audio—the beginning of Dharma communications was in Room 21 in a drawer. Kyōto, who was a head monk, had a tape recorder, and she would record the talks in here, and then she would go in her room. And when somebody said, ""Can I get a recording of that tape?"" she would go in and put a blank tape in, hit record, and then send it to the person. That was the beginning.

And so he was telling the story once that he was going somewhere and was listening. He had picked up a talk, he thought it was like a senior's talk. And he put it in and he starts listening to it, and there was something about the sound that was a little wonky, but he was listening, and it was good, it was like, good Dharma, but he was listening. He thought, ""Those are my words. They're like, completely quoting my words. They're like parroting everything I've said."" And then he realized it was him.

So Daido Roshi used to say, talk about how we encounter and practice the precepts on the basis of faith, right? Because they make sense and we can bring them into our lives. And that through our practice and years of training and examination and observing and inquiry and clarification, we begin to understand more and more deeply and broadly the profound nature of these teachings.

So they're one of the most, I think, kind of quintessential examples in Buddhism of a teaching that can seem that anybody can understand, right? A child could understand the precepts and be encouraged to follow them, right? They make that much sense or are that available or that sort of straightforward. And at the same time, they really embody the complete teachings, really the most deepest teachings of Buddhism, to see how they are nondual, arising from and manifesting selflessness, are always good medicine, are always good guides, are always revealing the light, life, and are not fixed, they are not rules, they are not dogmas—they're alive.

And so I'll speak about this a little bit more as the week goes on, but let me just offer this to take a little something back to your seat. In the Mumonkan commentary, or the poem, I think, or the commentary, it says, ""If you have an eye to see into this case, then you will know that the former head of the monastery did in fact enjoy their 500 happy, blessed lives as a fox."" So what is that pointing to?

This is from the Transmission of Light, Dogen. Dogen studied with Zen Master Ru Jing. Once, during meditation, sitting late at night, Ru Jing said to the assembly, ""Zen study is a shedding of mind and body."" Hearing this, suddenly, Dogen was greatly enlightened. He went right to the abbot's room and lit incense.

Ru Jing asked him, ""What are you burning incense for?""  
Dogen said, ""My body and mind have been shed.""  
Ru Jing said, ""Body and mind shed, shed body and mind.""  
Dogen said, ""This is a temporary byway. Don't approve me arbitrarily.""  
Ru Jing said, ""I'm not.""  
Dogen said, ""What is that which isn't given arbitrary approval?""  
Ru Jing said, ""Shedding body and mind.""  
Dogen bowed.  
Ru Jing said, ""The shedding is shed.""

At that time, Ru Jing's attendants said, ""This is no small matter, that a foreigner has attained such a state."" Ru Jing said, ""How many times has he been pummeled here? Liberated, dignified. Thunder roars.""

Keizan's verse:  
Clear as pure light. No inside or outside, is there any body or mind to be shed?

The character for shedding here can mean dropping off, forgetting, casting away. So, shedding body and mind—what is it that is shed? We have a physical body, we have mind. Are they the same? Are they different?

Daido Roshi brought body practice as a deliberate and particular aspect of our training here—one of the Eight Gates—and he spoke of it as the miracle of aliveness, which I've always liked a lot. The miracle of aliveness in the Eight Gates. Daido Roshi says, ""Body practice is not exercise. It's not martial arts or aerobics, jogging or pumping iron. Body practice is nothing other than washing the face, cleaning the body, urination, elimination, cooking food, eating a meal, healing sickness, actualizing birth, practicing life, realizing death. Only when this is understood can we begin to speak of martial arts, aerobics, pumping iron. Body practice is concerned with self-realization through the body. It is realizing that this body is the body of the Buddha, the body of this entire universe.""

One of the things we realize when we come into practice is that practice is a very bodily thing, right? We use it. The first thing that happens is we're taught zazen: to take a posture, to turn inward. In Dogen's fascicle ""Body-Mind Study of the Way,"" he wrote, ""To study the Way with the body means to study the Way with your own body."" You can't use somebody else's, and you can't use yours until you fully inhabit yours, or to some reasonable degree. It's the study of the Way, using this lump of red flesh. The body comes forth from the study of the Way. So as we practice, the body becomes revealed through the Dharma. The Dharma—our Dharma study—reveals the body: all that it is, all else it is, and also what it isn't.

Everything that comes forth from the study of the Way is the true human body. The entire world of the ten directions is nothing but this true human body. The coming and going of birth and death is the true human body. It can't be known apart from the body. That's why Buddhism, Buddhadharma, is very specifically about the human world, the human realm, the human life, the human body and mind.

To turn the body around, abandon the ten unwholesome actions, keep the eight precepts, take refuge in the three treasures, leave home, and enter the homeless life—this is the true study of the Way, and for this reason, it's called the true human body. Those who follow this must not be like outsiders who hold the view of spontaneous enlightenment.

I was listening to a teacher recently who said that in Tibetan Buddhism, Tibetans tend not to say, ""I am a Tibetan Buddhist,"" but they use a word that says, essentially, ""I am an insider."" Which doesn't mean an insider as part of an elite group, but rather, ""I'm not an outsider. I'm not going out seeking. I'm an insider."" As this teacher said, it's an inside job.

This true human body: is that your physical body, your emotional body, psychological, spiritual body? Is it the Skandhas? This is the body of emptiness. Well, what would you leave out?

If we want to be free in this world, that means being free in this life, which means being free in this body and mind. So what would we leave out or deny?

You know, when we're first introduced to zazen—I first learned it from a book, because that's all I knew there was—but to actually be given instruction... In fact, the first time I came here, I was sitting in the zendo on a Sunday morning. Kyodo, the head monk, when they made the announcement for beginning instruction, came up to me, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, ""Don't you need beginning instruction?"" I said, ""No, I'm good."" Arrogant. I did not know what I did not know.

But then, when we're receiving this instruction, we shouldn't underestimate the posture: taking the posture of a Buddha, sitting on the seat, the diamond seat. This posture, which is a body of wisdom, taps into our own intelligence, our own sort of perfectness within this body that allows the body to find stability more than we can imagine. Aliveness, more than we can imagine. An openness of pathways, more than we can imagine. A leaping beyond this very body itself, more than we can imagine.

Just these basic elements of sitting upright—that you hold up your own weight. You know, we can think of these things as just, you know, sort of physical manifestations, like do this, do this, do this, without any sense that it's connected, it's part, it's an expression of a basic wisdom and intelligence, a Buddhadharma in this body. And that zazen is a pathway, which means that pathway has to get opened, right? And what we encounter when we zazen is all of the pathways that are not open—those are our struggles. And it is also at the very moment that it is a pathway—the thing itself, the very thing that we're seeking.

Sitting upright, facing forward—it's not a retreat, it's not an escape. Senses are open. It's not a withdrawal. Alert and relaxed. Sounds good. Not so easy. Not so easy because we're not relaxed, we're not alert. Awake.

The body sits zazen, but you don't sit in this body. You don't sit apart from it. The body knows. It's really turning towards the body's intrinsic wisdom. It knows things arise. And we practice: not naming, not denying, not indulging, not distracting, not clinging. We turn our attention to the breath. We follow the breath. Where is it going? We speak of being the breath. Have you ever been apart from it? Turn this body around.

Dogen says, don't be an outsider looking at it objectively. Zazen is very simple. It's not complicated. And if we have the basic physical, mental, emotional ability to do zazen, then that means we have that at the very beginning. So why is it so difficult?

Thoughts arise, emotions come and go. They seem to occur within this body. We experience thoughts in our mind. Energy—we begin to encounter, for lack of a better word, energy. Ki, aliveness, spirit. Something is moving. We can feel it in our eyes, our throat, chest. In large part, in the beginning, it's a tangle. It's almost like a logjam. It's all tangled up. And so we experience it as a tangle. Bound, uncomfortable. It may be strong, it may be weak, it can come and go, it can be tense, it can be relaxed.

It's one of the really important aspects of sitting still and actually experiencing all of those fluctuations, all of those movements. Then, in so many moments, we would just simply rather not, if you don't mind. But there they are.

So we're beginning, introduced to this body-mind, seeing how they arise together. It's interesting, over the years, how many people have come through here who have spent much of their lives in their body doing different forms of yoga practice or martial arts or sports. People in the military who have done really impressive things with their body, right, that required all kinds of abilities, capacities, skill, courage. And yet, something about sitting on this simple mat and going inside—it's not like others. I've seen people who have done genuinely heroic, courageous things in their life become weak-kneed, fearful, reluctant, hesitant, just starting to turn inside to realize the self through the body.

If we identify ourself as anything, it's the body, right? Why do we cling to it so much as it ages? Why does society, or people in society, invest so much in the perfect body—the body that, if you had, everything would be great, you would be happy forever, everyone would love you. And what happens when you get there? You start to age, and that body begins to age, as it must, because that's part of its intelligence, it's part of its wisdom. It follows the natural laws. How do we feel about that?

We feel our emotions, sensations, everything within our body. But where are they? Can you find them?

Daido Roshi says self-realization needs to be with our whole being. Unfortunately, the search for self-knowledge is usually regarded as purely a function of the intellect. Feeling and intuition are largely considered to be subjective and therefore unreliable instruments for realizing truth. Yet by reducing the search for truth to an intellectual activity, we achieve only a distorted understanding of who we really are and of what's possible.

Body and mind have fallen away. Shed body and mind.

I came across an article by a scholar who said that Ru Jing never actually used the term ""body-mind."" They can't find it in any of his writings or any of his successors' writings. Only Dogen. It's only found in Dogen—in Dogen's teaching—and that the word for ""body-mind"" is a homophone for the word in Chinese for ""dust,"" and that what is found in the teachings of Ru Jing is that he talked about the dust of the mind, the dust from the mind. And so the scholar speculates that Dogen misheard, and Ru Jing was actually talking about dust. But Dogen heard it as body-mind. So he says Dogen must have misheard this term due to a lack of full comprehension of Chinese, intuitively misrepresenting it or purposefully changing it—which doesn't really matter, right? Because even if he heard it correctly, but then through his own experience—experience: body-mind shed—which is clearly what he experienced and was not based on a correct or incorrect interpretation of a character or word that his teacher had said.

Every person has their own direct experience. And part of training is to, in a sense, test that with the Dharma. I mean, everybody who practices is having experiences all the time, right? Just ordinary experiences, because we're having perceptions, our senses are picking up, we're in a body, things are happening, we're aware of them. So we're having experiences. But in terms of insights, deeper experiences—there are all kinds of experiences that can be had, that are had. But are they in alignment with the Buddhadharma? Which really means, are they helping you to awaken? Because we can have lots of experiences that might be quite wonderful, enlivening, inspiring, but they're not really helping us to awaken. And so part of training is to get clear about that.

One's own body, which is the body of the universe—this body, which is not yours, it's not something... It's your true body, your reality body. It's neither absolute nor relative body. It's not ""not this."" It's not ""not not this"" body. This is the body to be realized.

""The entire world of the ten directions,"" Dogen says, means that all ten directions are the entire world to consider. He says, consider the moment when front and back, vertical and horizontal are thoroughly reached. East, west, south, north, the four midpoints, up and down—the ten directions, front and back, vertical and horizontal. Consider this. He's basically talking about all of space. And then he says, to consider this means to understand and to resolve that this human body, undivided by self and others, is the entire world of the ten directions. This is to hear what has never been heard.

And so think about, in the Metta Sutta, when the Buddha said, ""Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child, in the same way, with a boundless heart, should we cherish all living beings, radiating kindness over the entire world—upwards to the skies, downwards to the depths, outwards and unbounded."" It's exactly what Dogen is saying, and that's a meditation—in this case, a meditation of cultivating metta, loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.

But it's not just having a feeling, it's bringing forth that within the body, letting it infuse the body all throughout the body, and then letting that body become the body of the universe. So how do we practice that? By extending with our mind that quality, that characteristic in those directions: upwards to the skies, downwards to the depths, outward and unbounded, all four directions. And when the mind enters into that spaciousness, the body has to at the same time be spacious. And so then the body becomes a body of loving-kindness. The universe becomes a universe of loving-kindness. In that moment, it's not you, it's not apart from you. When it is undivided, it's not something that you're doing—it's just loving-kindness cast off.

So when we begin practicing that and it feels wobbly or distracted or tight or diminished—it's not that the loving-kindness itself is diminished, it's not that the body is limited in some way. Is it that symphony of body and mind working as one?

You know, the teachings say that when the body, when the mind—and whenever we think of mind, we have to think of body at the same time. If we talk about body, we have to think of mind at the same time because we have inherited, right, an attitude, a view of the world in which these are separated. So you can be a mind person, you can be a body person. But then when we're practicing this, we're not. I mean, we could think of it as reclaiming or just coming back to experiencing that body, that true human body freed from hatred and ill will, whether standing, walking, seated, lying down, freed from drowsiness, sustain that recollection, sustain that mind. This is the sublime abiding.

The Buddha said, ""My body and mind have been shed."" Dogen said, ""Dropped off, cast away."" Which, in a sense, is just the limitation of language, right? If the body and mind was something you could put your fingers on and cast away, we would have all done it. If it was a thing that had a place of its thingness, a location, and we could locate it, we could grab it because it's a thing. That's what you can do with things. And then we put it, put it somewhere, we'd all be enlightened.

And so to even say, ""My body and mind have been shed,"" is really just to say body and mind are liberated. And it's interesting how in this dialogue, Dogen says—when Ru Jing affirms, ""This body and mind have been shed,"" and Dogen says, ""Hang on, this is just a temporary byway, don't approve me arbitrarily."" He wanted to be sure. He clearly had some surety because he goes into the abbot's room and lights incense, and Ru Jing says, ""What are you doing?"" But he wants to be sure. He wants his teacher to be sure so that he can be sure.

So he says, ""Don't approve me arbitrarily.""  
Ru Jing says, ""I'm not.""  
And of course remember that they had been training together, that Ru Jing gave him—I don't know if it was unprecedented, but it was a very unusual invitation, particularly for somebody who had just come in—and he said, ""You can come to my abbot's room anytime."" An open invitation. So it wasn't that, you know, Dogen—he was just hearing this from Dogen for the first time and affirming him. He knew Dogen. So he said, ""This isn't arbitrary.""  
""What is it that you are not giving arbitrarily?""  
""Shedding body and mind.""  
And Dogen bowed, and Ru Jing said, ""Now the shedding itself is shed.""

When we first come into practice, for the most part, I think we know that we have a body, right? That's how we got here. And in a sense, we begin to experience its miracles, if they don't feel quite miraculous yet. We begin to thaw what is frozen, to come into contact with what has been numb, to begin to accept what has been denied, to let go of the idea of the perfect or imperfect body—which means the perfect or imperfect mind, which means the perfect or imperfect self. To let go of what we identify as with body and mind, and then to let go of letting go, freed from hatred and ill will towards others, towards ourself.

Hatred can only occur within a very solid body and mind that is frozen, that is numb in that moment—certainly towards the object of our hatred, but necessarily, because this body is the body and mind of the universe, towards oneself. One's own body has to be frozen, numbed, in order to freeze another, to hate another. But because by that time we have almost certainly adapted to that frozen body-mind—and not just adapted to it, but identified with it, quite possibly turned it into something quite productive, quite successful, rewards—when we free that, then we begin to experience the miracle of dignity, beauty, fragility, resilience, strength, intelligence, suffering. To really experience suffering, right? We don't really expect that that's part of the deal, right? To be free from suffering means that every sequential step to be moving further and further away from it—sorry, it's actually moving closer and closer, because it's an inside thing.

But so, to be able to experience that within this body, freely giving it passage, just like everything else. And really, the miracle of this body, which is not dependent upon size or shape or color or age or ability—but it has to be fully attuned or attuning to those things, which becomes quite important when we're sick, when we've been injured, when we're getting older, when we're getting frail, when we have an illness and the body does not move the way it did yesterday, cannot do what it did yesterday. That might be temporary, it might be ongoing.

This week, in conversations and communication and dokusans, it's like, okay, the sangha is aging. Just had repeated contacts with people who, either they themselves or their partners or somebody in their family is experiencing sickness, old age, and death. And even though we have been practicing for years and years, still, when it really comes home, when we really begin to experience it, it can be a little bit of a surprise. Because there's the idea, right, of sickness, old age, and death. And then there's being sick. There's the idea of aging. I mean, when I was younger, I had all kinds of ideas of aging. I would look at older people and think, ""What's with you anyway? Why can't you stand up straight, walk fast?"" It seemed like a choice, right? Arrogant.

It becomes real. And so where is the miracle of aliveness now, when it is not and cannot be dependent on those conditions because they're changing?

Dogen said, ""To bow all the way to the floor and to bow standing is dignified bearing in motion and stillness. Painting a decayed tree, polishing a brick of dead ash continues without stopping, playing freely with the true body, whether standing or walking, seated or lying down."" And so we practice cultivating, coming into contact with, enlivening the miracle of aliveness as we sit, as we walk, as we eat, as we clean, as we work, as we bow. It's a fundamental practice.

And every so often, usually a fairly new student will come in and say, ""Okay, now what? I got this. But now what?"" Start over, or start for the first time, maybe. Because the thing is, we can't experience the miraculousness until we do. And so until then, what we have to know is our actual experience, which feels some version of limited, confined, not miraculous.

And that's why these teachings are so important, that we keep hearing these teachings, which are reports from inside. And it's like, okay, I hear what you're saying. You're making it very sort of robust and describing this. You're using imagery. It's like, I can visualize it, but I don't know that. That is not my experience. That's the point—to hear that as a calling, an invitation, so that when we enter into these basic fundamental practices for the rest of our lives—sitting, standing, walking, lying down, bowing, eating, urinating, defecating, working—we're on an endless path of endlessly entering in more deeply, because our imagination cannot provide for us the sort of imagined reality of that.

You know, the level of our awareness at any moment reveals to us. It's like I was saying to somebody earlier, we open our eyes and it's like, ""I'm seeing everything there is to see in this room."" Seems like it. Am I? When we turn our attention inward and I have awareness of what I see, it's like, ""I am aware of everything there is to see."" No. No, it's like, okay, I hear you saying that, but... And so I can try and imagine. And usually what I'll imagine is some version of, you know, fantastical, magical, supernatural, something. No.

And so that's why hearing these teachings—and then it's like these teachings are intended to make you hungry, hungrier. I don't think I've tasted that yet, but I want to.

Keizan said, ""Reaching this point, when you observe closely, even if you use a thousand eyes, you do not find a particle of anything that can be called skin, flesh, bones, marrow. There's nothing to divide into mind, cognition, consciousness. How can you know coolness and warmth, how can you distinguish pain and itch? When the body is the body of the universe, there is no distinguishing. What would you affirm or deny, what like or dislike? This is why it has been said, when you see there's not a single thing.""

And so he's speaking about that mind, your natural mind. But isn't he also at the same time telling you how to do zazen? So when you are sitting, don't divide your mind, your body, cognition, consciousness. Don't separate coolness and warmth, don't grab onto one and reject the other. Don't, with everything that arise, choose it or reject it. Let all of those impulses calm.

And so then Daido Roshi says, as we're practicing this, then we can really begin to understand these forms of body practice: qigong, tai chi, yoga, dance, running, pumping iron—I don't even know if they still call it that. But most importantly, we practice it through the everyday, ordinary movements. Because if we're not doing that, then those other forms—it's not that they can't open that up for us, but they'll be restricted. And so when cooking and sweeping the floor and cleaning a bathroom and driving a car and holding a baby—sounds like caretaking, sounds like work, practice, sounds like a unified life.

I was thinking about—I was talking at breakfast with some folks, and you know, like when the presidential administration was talking about closing down the parks, and I thought, the people who are thinking this way—do you ever go outside? Do your feet ever touch the ground? Do you stand in the presence of a tree? Have you felt the miracle of what is not human but can be known within your human body?

I hear Elon Musk talk about AI and how that's going to save the world and we just need to get to Mars. Then it's like, okay, now it makes sense what you're doing. We don't matter. Doesn't matter. This Earth doesn't matter. Machines matter. What kind of frozenness, what kind of outsider, what kind of mind and body are not one is that? And how, the more pronounced that becomes, the more estranged—not just from others or Earth, but ourselves—in a sense, all things become possible in the worst way possible.

And the sort of—the hard thing about it is if we—we can't know something until we experience something. So even to come into practice and be drawn by the teachings, the reports from within that I have not experienced, but when I hear those, they're touching something in me, the affinity is not over here, it's here. So even if I haven't experienced that directly, if it's not really clear to me, something is being touched, something is alive. And if I don't experience that, at least in that moment, something is not. There is no affinity, there is no contact, there is no calling.

And so that's why the way we sit is so important. You know, we're training in each moment not just to calm our minds, but the whole body. And so to be upright, alert—which means there is a kind of effort which is actually very important. It's not passive, it's not ""not me, not now, it's not mine."" It's a middle way. It's a middle way which isn't a balance, although balance is good. It's something that has to be discovered and cultivated and loved.

I think of how, as sesshin goes on, even, you know, more beginning students sometimes will say this: everybody becomes more and more beautiful. What's happening there?

So I want to end with this miracle of aliveness with a poem by Walt Whitman:

---

Why, who makes much of a miracle?  
As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles.  
Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,  
Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,  
Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water,  
Or stand under trees in the woods,  
Or talk by day with anyone I love,  
Or sleep in the bed at night with anyone I love,  
Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,  
Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,  
Or watch honeybees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,  
Or animals feeding in the fields, or watch birds,  
Or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,  
Or the wonderfulness of the sundown,  
Or of stars shining so quiet and bright,  
Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring.  
These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,  
The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.  
To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle.  
Every cubic inch of space is a miracle.  
Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,  
Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.  
To me the sea is a continual miracle.  
The fishes that swim—the rocks—the motion of the waves—the ships with men in them.  
What stranger miracles are there?

This is from the Blue Cliff Record: The Diamond Cutter Scripture's Scornful Revilement.

A pointer. If you take up one and let two go, you're not yet an adept. Even to understand three corners when one is raised still goes against the fundamental essence. Even if you get heaven and earth to change instantly without rejoinder from the four quarters—thunder, rolling lightning, flying clouds, moving rain, rushing, overturning lakes, toppling cliffs, like a pitcher pouring, like a bowl emptying—you have still not raised up a half. Is there anyone who can turn the polar star? Who can shift the axis of the earth? To test, I cite this old case.

The Diamond Cutter Scripture says: If one is scornfully reviled by others, this person has done wicked acts in previous ages which should bring them into evil ways. But because of the evil and vilification by others in the present age, the wicked action of former ages is thereby extinguished.

The clear jewel is in my palm. Whoever has accomplishment will be rewarded with it. When neither stranger nor friend comes, it has utterly no abilities. Since it has no abilities, the evil one loses their way. Gautama. Gautama, do you know me or not? Pseudo also said: completely exposed.

Good morning. This weekend, Shoen Osho and I were leading a retreat on the Precepts and in the Eight Gates. Daido Roshi says, in essence, the Precepts are a definition of the life of a Buddha, or how Buddha functions in the world—how enlightened beings live their lives, relate to others, make moral and ethical decisions, manifest wisdom and compassion in everyday life.

At the monastery, the Precepts are the basis of the rules and guidelines for all residents. For those practicing away from the monastery, precepts provide a way to see how the moral and ethical teachings in Buddhism can come to life in the marketplace, relationships, government, business, ecology. The Precepts are unique among religious ethical teachings in that they are based on the experience of no self, and that experience makes all the difference in the world.

So we looked at how these teachings are from the very beginning. The Buddha's own original teachings are essential to Buddhist practice, to meditation, to enlightenment, to everything that Buddhism teaches. And as Daido Roshi says, they're based on the experience of no self, selflessness, emptiness of self. And that fact—that realization—makes all the difference in the world.

And so what is that basis? In the pointer, there's this very poetic and rather dramatic list of all these miraculous abilities, and yet, still, that doesn't even reach a half. But can you turn the polar star, shift the axis of the earth? This is not about a magical, supernatural display of powers. In fact, in the Zen tradition, that can be seen as a distraction, should you be so endowed with such powers. What makes all the difference in the world is realizing our self-nature, the unborn, undying body of the Buddha. Here we're freed from self-clinging, from fear, from anxiety, from cruelty.

This koan is interesting, I think, and on different levels. It's kind of startling. It hopefully gets one's attention. It's also a direct quote from the Diamond Sutra, which is one of the essential sutras of the Prajnaparamita body of teachings, which, as one scholar said on the back of one of the translations, is one of the most important bodies of religious teachings ever in human history. It's vast. The Heart Sutra that we chanted this morning is part of that body of teaching, which is even more succinct. The Diamond Sutra has a little bit more pages to it, and then there are successive sutras counted by lines: 8,000 lines, 15,000 lines, 25,000 lines, and so on.

And so this is a direct quote from the Diamond Sutra, and it's speaking about karma. That's why I thought it'd be good to bring it up this morning at the conclusion of this retreat. There are a number of koans that speak, draw directly from a basic Buddhist teaching. So here, quite explicitly from the Diamond Sutra, it's presenting a basic Buddhist teaching about karma, which means that it brings into the koan that basic fundamental understanding of karma in Buddhism.

And that's not actually what the koan is about—or rather, that basic understanding that I'll speak about is a lot of what we talked about yesterday. It's how to understand karma, how can it be spoken about, how can we gain understanding of it so that we can practice well? The Buddha said if we don't understand karma, it's going to be very difficult at best to practice well, because we will continue not understanding the nature of cause and effect. We will continue to play out deeply held habits of mind and emotion and reactivity, which will bring forth the same consequences. And we won't understand why; we won't understand why is that happening?

And so the Buddha said, we need to understand as deeply as we can. He said, the nature of karma is so deep, so profound, that only a fully enlightened being can fully understand all of the web, the strands of karma. But as practitioners, we can understand it deeply enough to help us. And so that basic understanding is brought out. But the koan, as is almost always the case, and interestingly, in these cases where it brings out a basic teaching which could be explained and understood, is looking at it at the fundamental level—not at the level at which it can be explained, not at the level at which basically everyone who understands Buddhism or karma in Buddhism can speak about or understand, but at the basis, because that makes all the difference, as Daido Roshi said.

Otherwise, if that wasn't important or necessary, we wouldn't need to do the meditation that we do, certainly not to the extent that we do it. We wouldn't need to do much of what we do. We would just need to study the teachings, learn them, change our behavior. But even that, you know, that in a sense is telling us that when we try to just change our behavior, even if we change the behavior, other things don't change because there's something at the fundamental that is unchanged.

That's why the Buddha said, developing concentration—samadhi—has a temporary transformative effect. It's calming, it's really important, but it doesn't actually pull up the roots of our false views. It doesn't really liberate us from our clinging.

The Buddha said in an early sutra: ""I declare, students of the way, that actions willed—those arising from intention, performed and accumulated—will not become extinct as long as their results have not been experienced, be it in this life, in the next life, or in subsequent lives. And as long as these results of actions willed, performed and accumulated have not been experienced, there will be no making of an end to suffering.""

So this is really important, and this is very much a part of this understanding of karma—that intentional action through our thought, words, and actions brings forth a consequence. That is our basic concern in Buddhism, because it's arising from a desire, which means it's arising from my mind, which means it's arising from the way I see things, from my attachments, from my sense of self. It's dependent upon and laden with my own entanglements. And that desire then comes out in my thoughts, words, and actions, and then that becomes part of its consequence.

And so the teaching is that when the consequence to that action manifests, as Shoen Osho talked about yesterday—the teaching of three times—it might happen in the near future, in the immediate moment, it might happen much later, or it might happen, within traditional Buddhism, in a subsequent lifetime. And part of the teaching of that is that karma is not optional. Basically, ""I'd rather not participate if you don't mind""—like, that's not an option. In the human world, every intentional action has a consequence, will bear fruit.

So as we talked about, the idea that ""can I get away with this? Can I do something that I want that basically goes against the precepts or what is good and suffer no consequence?"" And Buddhism says: no, not possible. How and when that consequence comes up, we don't know yet. We'll see when it arises. And so that's a way of helping us to have faith that the idea of getting away with something is a waste of time, basically, right? Much better to clean up our house, to live well, to develop compassion.

And so when that consequence arises, that's the moment—it's like a propitious moment—because the qualities of that action that I have committed continue to exist in me until the consequence, and have force and be influencing me until the consequence of that action, the result, arises within me, within my life. And now is my opportunity, as the Buddha said, to liberate myself. He speaks of extinguishing, of freeing, of dissolving those seeds so they don't continue to manifest.

And so that depends on how do I meet that moment? If I've done something out of anger, and the consequence of that is something that brings anger with it towards me, and I respond again with anger, well, then I'm just taking those seeds and planting them again. But if I respond in a different way, compassionately, with mindfulness, awareness, within a vow, then they begin to dissolve. Those energies are transformed into something that is life-giving rather than taking away.

That's why when we are in the midst of those strong emotions—Shoen Osho talked about the kleshas, these very strong afflictive emotions that are the basis for our actions as they overtake us—that's why it's so important that when those arise, and in a sense, the stronger they are, the more important it is, although sometimes the more difficult it is to practice them well. Because from a Buddhist perspective, that's how the karma of those kleshas begins to transform, and that's always available to us.

The Buddha said, ""If one says that whatever way a person performs a karmic action, in that very same way they will experience the result—in other words, in that case, there will be no possibility for Dharma life, and no opportunity would appear for making a complete end to suffering. But if one says that a person who performs a karmic action with a result that is variably experienceable—can be experienced in different ways—then they will reap its result accordingly. In that case, there will be the possibility for them to live a liberated life, and an opportunity would appear for making a complete end to suffering.""

So what he's saying is that karma is not determined. It doesn't determine. It's not deterministic. It's not fatalistic. It's ongoing. It's always in process, which means we always have the ability, the opportunity to shift, to turn—no matter how intractable a situation, or we ourselves, or someone else might be. And that's really important, right? That's why the Bodhisattva doesn't suffer defeat. We might have moments where we feel defeated, where it might feel intractable, it might feel hopeless. But really what's happening in that moment is, in a sense, we're indulging. We're sort of getting mired, right, in an emotion, in a thought process, in an imaginary world that doesn't actually exist, in which we are defeating ourselves.

And so the Bodhisattva recognizes that, takes another breath, takes another step, because nothing is fixed. Isn't that good news? Hell, yeah, it's good news.

So think about the variable ways in which we can experience something. So I say something that is hurtful to you, and you respond with injury, with hurt. And I see that, and I don't care, and I walk away. I say something that is hurtful to you, and I see that land on you, and you're hurt. And I'm deeply hurt that I have done that. That isn't what I want. That isn't how I want to be in the world. That isn't what I want my effect to be on you. I am so sorry that I said that. Let me make this right. We know those are two different experiences in the aftermath of something that I said and now I can't take back. But the karma is still moving. The effect is not fixed. It's variable.

And so the moment of action is important, but in a certain sense, from that moment, what's more important is what happens next.

A Chinese master said, ""Karma is a residual force of action. Whether actions are good or bad, they depend mainly on the mind. Thus, the presence of strong wisdom or resolution can cause karma to change."" And that means the consequence of karma, because karma is the initial action. Karma means what is possible, not what is predetermined. Hence, it can be transformed. Thus, Buddhism stresses past karma, but does not fall into the doctrine of fatalism.

So, obviously, this koan is taking up this question, this reality.

In another early sutra, the Buddha said, ""Both formerly and now, what I teach is suffering and the cessation of suffering. If others abuse, revile, scold, or harass the Buddha for this, then the Buddha, on that account, feels no annoyance, bitterness, or dejection of the heart. If another honors, respects, reveres, and venerates the Buddha for that, then the Buddha, on that account, feels no delight, no joy, no elation of the heart.""

Now, we might really just immediately appreciate that he isn't crushed by the criticism, but it's like, oh, but we'd like that elation, right? Why not that? And what's important to understand is this is not being cut off, distant. It's just not deflated by one, or made ecstatic by the other, right?

It's a very good practice. When we are being scolded or criticized or hearing difficult words, right? It's so easy to see the self arising, right? It's like a body practice. You feel the energy arising. You might feel a virtual wall of defense arising within you. You might see that your argument is already forming, right? And to just see that as a protection, a threat to the self—what is being threatened—and to just let that relax, breathe, listen, listen, actually hear the words, take them in, right? Even if the person in front of you seems out of their mind, there's probably some truth. As practitioners, my job is to hear that, tease that out, so that I can see that what about this is me? What can I learn? What is being reflected back that I can apply and benefit from? And in doing that, then I often see what remains—maybe that doesn't belong to me, maybe that isn't something I need to take up. And so, not to be deflated.

And at the same time, Daido Roshi used to say often, ""Don't believe in your own press notices,"" right? You read the reviews. Everybody loved you, right? Okay, thank you very much. What's for breakfast? So in other words, the self is not dependent upon—

Last week I talked about Chosen Roshi sending this little clip about, you can be a thermostat or you can be a thermometer. Thermometer is, my energy, my person, my temperature is totally dependent upon you. You love me, I'm doing great. You hate me, I'm doing terrible.

And so if one is scornfully reviled by others, this person has done wicked acts in previous ages, which should bring them down into evil ways. They've done something that was harmful. And when we do something that's harmful, that hurts others and hurts ourselves—because it always goes in both directions—we can mask, numb, distract from the harm that it's causing ourselves. But what happens with practice is we start to feel that more and more. We should be able to feel that more and more. But what's also happening is we're actually—part of why it hurts, I think, is because we're actually going against our fundamental nature. Not just how we want to be in the world, if we want to be in the world in a good way, but at a deeper level, we're actually going against our basic nature.

And so, a person who has done this should, by the laws of karma, fall down into evil ways. In other words, that karma should continue to drag on them, right? And it's important to understand this isn't a cosmic justice system, right? There's no punishment. It isn't a system of punishment. In that sense, the whole idea of karma is it's just the way things work in the human realm. So when we act well and good things happen, it's not that we're being rewarded—by whom? It's not seen that way. It's just the natural results, consequences of affirming positive, generous, loving, compassionate actions coming from wisdom and selflessness. When the opposite is happening, it's not punishment, it's just the consequences of those actions.

And so, a person should be brought down into evil ways. But because of the scorn and vilification by others in the present, now, now the wicked actions of former ages are extinguished. One might wonder, well, why, as the Buddha said in his own sutra, why, if he's teaching, would he be on the receiving end of scorn and revilement? Sometimes we don't want to hear the truth, so shoot the messenger. Another scholar said maybe it's because this sutra, which is a Mahayana sutra, was being criticized by those of the early Buddhist tradition. Whatever the reason is, it's not so important here.

Hakuin, about this passage, said, ""This has been misunderstood by many people, past and present. There is something of significance here, you know. No more can be said about it. Everyone should look at it closely someday."" Very interesting. There's something of great significance here, you know. I can't say anything more than that, but someday, one day, get around to looking into it. Sometimes when you understate something, it's like a shout.

So again, the teaching is that because of past actions, the scorn or revilement that I'm receiving is a result of earlier actions. It is in that moment—if I respond well—that they will be extinguished. I will free myself of that karma. But what is it that's liberated?

So again, that's a practice way of looking at it. That's an essential way of understanding this. That is how we practice. I mean, every moment when we are practicing and something arises that we could easily respond to out of our habitual patterns that are not helpful, and we do that, if we pay attention, we will see that it's getting harder, it's getting more difficult. The Buddha said, yeah, you might be getting a little bit of pleasure. That's why we do it. But look underneath and see the danger. But it's pointing to something more ultimate.

In the commentary, it says, ""The general idea of this sutra is about the efficacy of the sutra itself and its teachings. Someone like this in former times created hellish deeds, but because of the strength of the sutra's good power, they have not yet suffered because they are practicing within the dharma. Because of scorn and vilification by people in the present age, those wicked actions of former ages are extinguished. This sutra, therefore, can extinguish the wicked deeds of innumerable eons, changing the grave to become light, changing the light to becoming inconsequential, and so on.""

And there are many Mahayana sutras that talk about how the sutra itself is not just sacred, but has a power. But then he goes on to say, ""Some say that the sutra itself has spiritual power. If so, take a volume of it and lay it in an uncluttered place and see if it has any effect on that room."" He quotes Fayan, who said, ""Realizing buddhahood is called upholding the sutra."" That's how we uphold the sutra—by practicing and realizing it.

In the sutra it says, ""All the Buddhas and the teachings of complete awakening of all the Buddhas all come forth from the scriptures. But tell me, what is it that you're calling the sutra? If the power is in the text, then all we should do is put the text in the middle of the room and just carry on as always. What is it that you call the sutra?"" he asks.

Because of the scorn and revilement in the present age—not the present age, but in this moment. So the student of this koan has to enter into that very moment. It has to become real and alive.

We create mental images and words that have meaning in our mind all the time. We make it up. Our mind is creating—maybe about something that's right in front of us. Often it's about something that is not in front of us. It may not even exist in the world. But in those mental images and words, they have power, right? How do we know that? Because we react to them. So we have certain thoughts, and we start getting aroused. We have other thoughts, we start getting angry. We have other thoughts and mental images, and we become fearful, and so on. That's showing us that they become—they take on a reality in our mind that we actually start reacting to as though they're real.

And that's a lot of what we're trying to free ourselves of, because we can spend—I mean, just examine how much of the thoughts in your mind on an ordinary day are actually helping you. They're constructive. They're helping you gain more understanding about something. They're leading to some action. They're based in mindfulness. And then how many fall outside of those? I would venture to guess most of them; I hope I'm wrong. But most of us are just caught in obsessive, habitual patterns of thought that actually are not only not helpful but are hurting us in multiple ways.

So in a koan like this, and in much of practice—visualization practices, the four immeasurables—when you hold an image of somebody in your mind, we bring forth words and images that have power. We give them power to make something real. The difference is you're doing this deliberately. You're doing it within mindfulness, and you're doing it in such a way that is based in something that is in accord with the Dharma, so that you can realize something that is Dharma. It's not something that's happening to you. You're summoning this very powerful capacity that we have and putting it to good use.

It's kind of extraordinary, right? We might think that we have to—the instruments of our delusion, we have to, like, stop them and then get rid of them and go to Home Depot and get a whole new set, right? Dharma Home Depot. You know, it's probably much smaller. I don't know, maybe not—probably cheaper. But actually, we take—we don't need to do that because we are already endowed with what we need. We just have to put it to good use.

And so here, the student enters into and creates that world: being scornfully reviled by others as a result of my past actions in the present moment—it's happening right now. By virtue of that, the karma of that, the ongoing consequence, the ongoing weight, life of those actions is dissolved. I'm freed from them. What is that? That's what this koan is bringing the student to.

When there's no defense, no wall, no liking or disliking, no pride that arises, no insecurity, no self—if those things are arising, then that becomes the stuff of what that student has to release themselves from, right? The stuff that we would normally easily respond with some of those things. So if those responses arise in the koan, in a way, that's just showing them that they really are making it real. But now they have to go beyond that, so that when no self arises now, what becomes of that scorn? What becomes of the karma of those previous actions? Where do they live now? What is it that we're calling the sutra?

Think about atonement, right? This is a practice—we talked about this yesterday—that is really important and is really based in this fundamental truth: ""All evil karma ever created by me on account of my beginningless greed, anger, and ignorance, born of my body, mouth, and thought, now I atone for it."" I don't make excuses, I don't blame anyone, I don't defend myself. I abandon everything. I abandon the self. I atone. There is no distance, no separation. There's only this. Now, where—what remains?

There are many practices of living the life of a Buddha, as Daido said, and fortunately, wonderfully, there are many practices that we can take up at the very beginning, because they're just using your voice, they're just using your mind in ways that are familiar to you, right? So we're given language that is based in wisdom before we know what wisdom is. We're given language and practices that arise out of selflessness before we've experienced that. We're given practices and teachings and invited to bring them into our own body, into our own voice, that are the manifestation of compassion—in moments when we're not really feeling very compassionate. How powerful is that? And in a sense, we're taking the sutra—if you think of just all of those as sutras that seem to exist outside—and we're bringing them in, and at some point, we realize what the scripture is, what the sutra is, and then you're never without it. You can't lose it. No one can take it away.

And so, we have these practices that are so, in a way, accessible. And, as I said yesterday, what's so important is that—and how they work hand in glove with our meditation—because when our minds are scattered, we can do any practice, we can say any words. And that scripture is over there somewhere, right? It's in the room, but it may feel like it's on the other, you know, across the way. Can hardly feel it, touch it. But the more stable our mind is, the more focused, the more developed our meditation is, it comes rushing right up, it crawls right under your skin. It starts moving through your blood. That's turning the polar star, shifting the axis of the earth.

And so if we really see the relationship, this sort of beautiful and essential relationship, between—why do we sit in the morning before a teisho, right? Because zazen, in and of itself, is good, that's enough. And because there is going to be a teisho, we sit so that we can hear, right? So that we can hear more deeply. Take it in more deeply.

The clear jewel is in your palm. Whoever has accomplishment will be rewarded with it. When neither stranger nor friend appear, it has utterly no ability. When the coming and going, the liking and disliking, all the many things begin to fall away, we lose our ability in the most wonderful way. The constant self-making, world-making, delusion-making, suffering-making mind—so busy—can we please let it rest and lose those abilities? We don't need them. Since it has no abilities, then the evil one loses their way, right? So when all the students of the Dharma in the Buddha's time were suddenly in the presence of Mara, and Mara was trying to undermine their practice, get them to lose their way, and the student says, ""Oh, I know you now,"" Mara has lost their way. They have no power.

So I'll end with a poem and thank you for this weekend. It was really nice. I felt very engaged and like it mattered—the subject, because it does. But it's such a gift to be in the presence of that. You know, in the early years when things were very much the same and so different in terms of the climate of Buddhism, what Buddhism was, where it was at in the country, what people understood about it, you know, and oftentimes, you know, people would come here and really, you know, were looking, were sincerely exploring and looking, but, you know, were often not in very much—and that has changed so much. And to be able to practice together with you, and even when people are coming and they don't know yet, they don't know if this is their path, but they are looking. And so in the place where they look, there is sincerity, there is engagement, because they want to know, and that makes all the difference.

So thank you. I'll end with a poem:

Dreaming yesterday, dreaming tomorrow,
Today too is a dream.
Dreaming sorrow, dreaming contentment.
Let us dream every living creature awake.
Let us dream ourselves awake.
Dream yourself awake.
That's a good dream.

Seeing all these books, you would be right to be worried and doubting about what might be or getting ready to happen. I will try and redeem myself and gain your trust. So we're going to do a series of mondos—myself, Kokon, and Shosan—on some of the gates. As I mentioned, I'll go opening out. I aim to speak on the others in different ways, at different times. So, how fitting that we would start with zazen. I wanted to focus tonight on shikantaza, and then in the next one, focus on koan. As a way of beginning, before we get into it specifically, I want to lay some groundwork.

I think one of the things to keep in mind is that all things—and specific to what we're doing, all aspects of all forms of practice—are not fixed. They're not unclear, and they're not necessarily ambiguous, but they're not fixed. And so we can think of zazen—breath awareness, shikantaza, koan—as a particular practice. Each is a particular practice. We can give instruction, basic instruction. Everyone who takes up a new practice is given some instruction. And then there can be the sense: Well, this is what that is. And that's not not true, but it's not all that it is. Zazen has to be not fixed because you're not fixed. The student is not fixed. Your mind, your practice, your evolving is in a constant state of change.

And so the practice, in a certain sense, has to have a stability, so that every time you go to sit, you have a clear understanding of what you're doing and it meets you. It's not that every time you sit down you're trying to do something different. And at the same time, even with the emphasis we have on teaching within our tradition—face-to-face teaching, a lot of personal guidance in our lineage—most of the time you're guiding yourself, right? Most of the time you're the one who's practicing and responding to whatever you're experiencing.

And so that's why I feel that if we... And what I want to do tonight is start first: What are we doing? What is the aim of zazen? And again, not to nail this down because it can't be. But there is something that we're doing, there is something that we are about, both within Buddha Dharma itself and also in zazen. There are many different ways we could talk about that. As part of what I was trying to get to within myself, I'll sort of begin one way this time, and then when we take up the koan, maybe look at it in a slightly different way.

So, I was looking at this, studying the sutra—an early sutra by the Buddha on dependent origination. It's called the Maha Nidana. Nidana is Sanskrit, maybe Pali, for dependent origination, which is arguably the most important teaching of the Buddha. It encompasses, in a certain way, so much of his teaching, and I would say arguably one of the most important teachings ever brought to humanity. But that's not really what I'm going to talk about. I forgot—I got so swept up. What I wanted to do is draw a little bit from the introduction by Bhikkhu Bodhi, because there he spoke about some things that are familiar to most of us. But again, when things are presented with different language, in a different way, it can be illuminating.

So, he's drawing from the sutra, but he talks about how the Buddha was speaking about, within a particular context, that there is a pathway for what he called designation, for language, and for description. So there's a pathway. Let's think of zazen as a pathway in which we engage in designation, language, and description. So Bhikkhu Bodhi says, first of all, what do we mean? What are we talking about? He says, basically within the commentaries, these words are understood to be synonymous, with minor differences, to mean verbal statements expressive of meaning. So he's talking about language—designating things through language, using language, and describing. And he says the passage can be taken to be talking about the relation between concepts, language, and reality.

So, we are constantly interfacing with, interacting with, responding to, coming to conclusions about our world. And we do that reality—and we do that to a large extent, larger than I think we really know—through language and concepts. That's an important part of what Buddhism is trying to help us to see. But the question is, what relevance is that? Why does that matter?

So, to make it relevant, he says it's necessary to investigate the nature of reference. In other words, in designating, in language, and designation, language, and description—what is being designated? What is being described? Well, something. He's referring to this as a referent—what we're referring to. He says that establishes a connection between ourselves, our experience, and language, words, and things. Designation, language, and description are the tools of reference by which we interpret and evaluate our experience privately to ourselves, and then we communicate those thoughts to others.

So we're having a private experience, but then it's shared through our language with others, and in that way becomes larger. And of course, that private experience becomes more of a common experience as we try to agree on what certain things are and what they mean and so on. He says it's this world of reference—it's the world and all of its many objects—that we are referring to, designating, using language to discuss and describe.

He says, but reference—to refer to something—involves more than simply the indication of something. It's more than just recognizing there's something there. He said it also involves signification, the ascribing of meaning to the referent. While the referent, the object, provides the locus for meaning—what we're focusing on and the meaning we attach to it—the meaning itself is contributed by the mind. The object doesn't have meaning, it's just object. But the mind gives it meaning. It means something to us. What is its significance? When I see it, what does it mean to me? Is it important? Is it not important? Is it worth my attention? Is it not? Do I like it? Do I not?

And this is all a wind-up, right, to get to zazen. Okay, so stay with me here.

So, every morning we chant: ""Doing deep prajna paramita, clearly saw emptiness of the five conditions, the aggregates, thus relieving misfortune and pain."" I mean, if that line doesn't get anybody's attention—even if you have no idea what the conditions are—something, somebody, this person, this bodhisattva, clearly saw emptiness of these conditions—whatever the hell those are—and relieved misfortune and pain. Don't you want to know what that is?

So the skandhas basically are how Buddhism describes you, the person. In dependent origination, if you're familiar with that, it's name and form. So form is your body. I mean, it can be spoken of in different ways, but let's just take it as your body. You have a physical body in which you experience things physically, which means anything that you can experience tangibly with your senses. And then there's name. Name and form is how it appears in dependent origination. Name are the other skandhas: sensation, conception, discrimination, awareness—what is your mind doing, right?

And so, when it comes into contact, when the mind comes into body, into contact with an object through the body, right—and in a sense, form engages in some other meeting, some other form, an object—what happens? The skandhas are in the way. The Buddha says that's what we are, that's how we create ourselves—it's through the skandhas. It's how we create the world. It's where suffering is born: within the skandhas. That's why that line in the Heart Sutra is so profound, because it's saying, basically, if we understand the nature of the skandhas, we alleviate our pain and suffering.

So here Bhikkhu Bodhi is talking about that. The designation—when we designate, when we add meaning to that—that depends on those aspects of the person or the mental aspect, right? What's happening in our mind, it's the mental body. And remember, don't think of this just as thoughts. It's that aspect of our mind that makes contact through our senses, has perception, recognizes, designates, names, evaluates: like, don't like, neutral, and then responds—begins to create karma.

So he said, it's this in the mental body that designations, linguistic expressions, and descriptions take shape, and from there that they are ascribed—end products of a complex process, drawing upon the contributions of many individual mental factors. So, when we just open our eyes and look—I look at this screen, I see your faces, those of you who are at home—and as far as I can tell, I'm just having an objective, almost a passive experience. Almost passive, except that I'm seeing something of something that's out there that exists by itself. So I'm having an objective experience of an objective reality. Right? I don't see that my mind is in a process, in fact, in a complex process of not only seeing this object, but giving it meaning.

And then he likens it to photographs in a camera. He says, the conceptual and verbal symbols that issue from this mental body can be no more accurate in representing actual reality than the instrument which creates them. Right? So in other words, if you've got a camera that's not working well, it's not reasonable to think that your photographs are going to turn out clear and sharp. Right? If my mind is compromised, is cloudy, is fraught, is consumed, is intoxicated, then that is the instrument through which I'm experiencing the world. It's unreasonable then to think that I'm going to have a clear experience.

And so he goes on to say, when feeling is seized upon as food for desire—feeling here means contact, sensation, when he's going through the skandhas—okay, so form, sensation. When sensation is seized upon as a food, something that feeds my desire. When perception—the next skandha, where I begin to recognize what I'm seeing—becomes a scanning device for finding pleasure and avoiding threats to the ego. So as soon as I begin to perceive something, I want to know: Do I want this or do I not want this? Is this friend or is this foe?

With volition, which we translate as conception—so volition here means intention. It's where we begin to create karma—is driven by greed, anger, and delusion. And our attention, meanwhile, is bouncing around in a very scattered, distracted way, agitated. He says, then one can hardly expect the mental body to mirror the world as it really is—a flawless, precise concept and expression. To the contrary, the system of references that results will be muddled, reflecting our individual biases, our presuppositions, and our wayward emotions, right?

But he goes on to say, the uninstructed worldling—in the early sutras, somebody who's not practicing is often referred to as a worldling or an earthling, which means somebody who's not practicing—the individual, unlearned and untrained, not practicing, does not even suspect the falseness of what we're perceiving, not knowing that their real origins are purely internal. It's not an objective experience one assumes. I assume that I am simply duplicating in thought what exists as concrete fact. So my designation, my description of it, the language that I use, as far as I can tell, is an accurate representation of what I'm experiencing, right? Because that's—I'm just—I haven't examined, right? It's never been brought to my awareness. I've never wondered. So I just take it as a fact.

He says, thus one takes them to possess objectively the meaning we ascribe to them, as standing for a self and its belongings. He says, through the designation ""mine,"" we establish a territory over which I claim control. And that control is me. That's my territory. That's what I need to be in control of, right? Which then, it makes sense that anything that comes into my territory, I want to have some control over, right? And then he says, the objects of these conceptual and verbal manipulations are the aggregates.

And this is important because the aggregates—I think it takes time. It did, is, and has for me to study these, because they can seem very complicated and dense and hard to understand. And sometimes because you encounter them with different translations. So you'll encounter the skandhas, and they'll be translated differently at different times. And sometimes it's hard to keep track of it. And then what is each one? How does that work? How is that the construction of the self? So that's why it bears study.

He says—this is a quote from the Buddha—""there being material form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness, these skandhas. It is referring to them, adhering to them, that one considers."" It's through that process that one comes to the view or the sort of certainty: this is mine, this is what I am, and this is myself.

He said that's sort of a shorthand way of just talking about the basis of our delusion, because it's with those designations of ourselves—what belongs to me, what I identify as and with, and what I experience as myself—that everything, every bit of trouble and unhappiness and disease and lack of peace arises.

So, he says, correct designation requires that the referent object be designated without overshooting its real nature by attributing to it some significance it does not have. So, kind of a nice way of saying we see something—it's not like we're completely missing the mark—but we overshoot. We project unrealistic, unreal, not actual characteristics, qualities, possibilities, hopes and dreams onto the object. And then, not surprisingly, we are disappointed. We're disappointed because it didn't do what I thought it was going to do, what I saw its potential to do. Dissatisfaction to come.

Okay, so hold that there. Okay, back to the question: What is zazen aiming at?

So, remember that the three trainings are your moral being—not creating harm and bringing about all that is good; samadhi, which does mean to gather the mind—it sort of includes mindfulness, but samadhi actually is more concentration. So it's the development of mindfulness, which is a deeper state of concentration. And the reason samadhi is important is because it has two primary functions. One is it's calming, right? It's settling. Bhikkhu Bodhi says that it puts the kleshas—all these very active and sort of roiling emotions and energies and thoughts and the things that we, you know, that spin us—he says it kind of puts them into a state of suspension. It doesn't eradicate, it doesn't dissolve them. They're still there, but they're just suspended. They're not active. Calming, or letting sort of go quiet. So that's one aspect.

The other is because of that, it then allows the mind to become very concentrated, focused, with a capacity for sort of penetrating insight that isn't available to us when the mind is spinning. It's just not available. Our mind has the capacity for that, but it's not available to us. We can't actually experience things that way because that quality of mind is not present. So that's important. And he makes a point that, you know, in a lot of other forms of meditation, that is the point. That's what meditation in other traditions often are striving towards, because it is powerful, it's good medicine, right? It changes you. It has a transformative effect. But what the Buddha said is, that effect is impermanent. It's dependent upon that particular state of mind. And that ultimately, what frees us is what Avalokiteshvara realized—doing deep prajna paramita within a deep state of concentration, she was able to have a penetrating insight into the emptiness of self.

So those three elements—because the Buddha said, you know, if we're living in accord with our basic nature, which is the precepts, which is also the basic nature of everything in the universe, then we will be living a more joyful life and we won't be generating the need for a lot of remorse and regret, right? Because we're not causing trouble. We're not doing things that then we feel bad about, which is very agitating. And he said that's extremely conducive—not having remorse is extremely conducive to all of the good qualities of mind and emotion and thought that are very conducive to your meditation and your mindfulness, your concentration. And that then is very conducive to your gaining insight. So that's why those three trainings are so tightly and beautifully joined together—because they're all working together.

So, then think about when we begin sitting—I want to get to shikan, but when we begin sitting, what happens? What do you have to deal with? Well, you have to deal with your body, right? And assume some posture and sit in stillness and begin to deliberately bring your mind to attention on the breath, right? And it's not that we have never done those things, but usually unless we've meditated, we haven't done them in this particular way and within a teaching. And so then we encounter our breath, right? We've been breathing every single moment of our life, right? And suddenly it gets very complicated. There's tension. It's taut. We're panting, we can't find the breath. And we're trying to focus our mind. And so we might get very tense in that focus because we're trying to focus and not have our mind wander, so we sort of tighten. And so we experience discomfort. We want to go away from that, right? But we're trying to stay. We experience things that we like. We want to go with them, run away with them, but we're trying not to do that. It's very hard. It's very tempting. We do. But then we come back. But then we run. But then we come back. But then we run, because that's a lot more exciting than what's happening right now.

And then we experience things we don't like. And we have a lifetime of strategies about what to do about that. And we employ them unconsciously. We don't even know it. We avoid, we deny, we blame, we numb, we go to sleep. So we're living on the cushion, and it just keeps happening. But now it happens within a mind that is developing an awareness. I see. I see you. And the ""you"" is me. And we are deliberately trying to stay focused and let go, right? So now we become more keenly aware of this thing we call attachment, right? And how deeply embedded it is, how habitual it is. How even when I want to let go, oftentimes I don't seem to be able to.

There's a great deal that is happening when we begin sitting. And, you know, of course, we're not aware of all of that at once. If we did, we'd just be overwhelmed. We're aware of, in individual moments, certain aspects. So in one moment we're the breath. The next moment we're aware of something going on in the body. Next moment we realize our mind has wandered and we're back to the breath. So it's like it's manageable, right? Because in a way, we're just dealing with discrete moments that are bringing a discrete sensation, contact, into our attention. And then what do we do? We perceive it, we name it, we recognize it, we like it or we don't like it, we have a strategy around that, we react to it. It's contest. And who is doing all of that? The self. The sense of self is doing it. I am doing that. I don't want this. I want this. I am meditating. I'm letting go.

And what's happening in almost every moment is designation, description, and language. My mind is constantly engaging. I remember thinking early in my training, my practice, when I was here, just the spontaneous way in which my mind would label something when it came, name it. And I remember thinking, I guess that'll always happen. I couldn't imagine that that would not happen, because I couldn't ever remember it not happening. I remember when my mind was starting to get settled down, I remember I was sitting—I was working on this dairy farm upstate. I remember sitting one morning, and I became aware my mind was fairly quiet, but I was aware that there was kind of a background dialogue, just a mumbling, no real content in the background. I wasn't losing my attention, but it was still running. And I remember thinking, I guess that will always be there too. I couldn't imagine that it would ever not be there, right? And all of those things that I just assume—I guess I just have to, you know, meditators just live with this, this is permanent—aren't. Right? They fade.

Okay, so I wanted to start with sort of both a conceptual, if you will, basis to just so that when we're sitting, you're not just following a rule, right? We do need instructions. We do need to have a sense of how to sit. That's really important. But then at the same time—and I think the Zen tradition has a very keen appreciation of this—how quickly we can get attached to just following a rule, right? As though that's all I need to do, and somehow I don't really have to be too actively a part of this and discerning at any given moment—just keep following the rule. And so I think if we understand sort of what zazen is a response to, why are we sitting—the more I practice, the more I think there is no more perfect response than zazen. It's almost like, you know, if you get to a certain point, which maybe only comes through zazen, it's like, how could you—how could I not do this if I want to follow this path?

I wanted to read a little bit—I forgot about this—I wanted to read a little bit from Roshi. He said, this is from the Eight Gates: ""Without zazen, there is no Zen. Zazen..."" He's speaking from a very particular perspective; he's talking to practitioners of Zen who center their focus in zazen. There are many, many people who are, you know, part of the Zen tradition or believe, you know, sort of identify as Zen Buddhist, but don't meditate. Okay, so this could also be seen as a kind of a biased view—anyway, it is. But it's a good one, right? ""Without zazen, there is no Zen. Zazen is the manifestation of the 10,000 dharmas, of the Great Way itself. We can study sutras and liturgy and art, body and mind, but without zazen they remain only the study of sutras, liturgy, art, body and mind. Not yet the study of the Great Way. To study face to face with a great teacher, or even with the Buddha himself, remains only study. It is not yet the eye-to-eye, mind-to-mind intimacy of the Way that is realized through zazen. Zazen itself is the miraculous manifestation of supreme enlightenment. As such, all things sacred and secular, all the so-called dragons and snakes, when encountered through zazen, reveal the marvelous mind of nirvana, the exquisite teaching of formless form, the very body and mind of the Tathagata. Zazen gives life to the Buddha.""

So I wanted to start with that ground and then just read a couple of short teachings from within our tradition about what zazen is really about. In the Platform Sutra, Huineng said: ""Good friends, when we practice and we don't contemplate the mind, we don't contemplate purity, and we don't talk about dispassion. If someone says to contemplate purity, your nature is already pure. It's because of deluded thoughts that reality is obscured. But once you are free of deluded thoughts, your original nature is already pure. If someone cultivates dispassion—that is detachment, like equanimity, not entanglement—as long as they don't pay attention to the faults of others, their nature is dispassionate. But deluded people act dispassionate, then open their mouths and talk right and wrong and turn their backs on the Way. Meanwhile, contemplating the mind and contemplating purity are actually what separates them from the Way. Some of you will remember this: We should realize clearly, however, this is not meditation, not contemplation, not visualization, not mindfulness. It is not found to be in the mudra, mantra, koan, neither in its stillness nor its functioning, its seated nor its active form, can zazen be said to be meditation. It is not single-pointed mind, which is often used to describe samadhi, no-mind, aware-mind, or trans-mind. It is not revealed in words and letters and is only transmitted one-to-one from Buddha to Buddha.""

In the Vimalakirti Sutra, Vimalakirti comes upon Shariputra, who is sitting in meditation. And Vimalakirti says, ""Reverend Shariputra, this is not the way to absorb yourself in contemplation."" Now, Shariputra is one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha. He knows how to meditate. ""You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that neither body nor mind appear anywhere. You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest all ordinary behavior without forsaking cessation—that is, without getting entangled in anything. Absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your cultivated spiritual nature. Sit in such a way that the mind neither settles within nor moves without toward any external form.""

In another passage, he's not talking specifically about zazen, but he's talking about the Dharma, which is zazen. And he says, ""Shariputra, if you're truly interested in the Dharma, you're truly interested in zazen, you should take no interest in anything."" And Robert Thurman, who translated this edition, this copy, has a footnote. And he says, ""This concludes Vimalakirti's definition of the religion of Buddhism in its true sense. If you really are interested in the Dharma, in zazen, take no interest in anything."" And then he goes on to say, ""Any personal interest that is self-centered, self-clinging interest in anything—even Dharma, or Nirvana, or zazen—is nonetheless a selfish, self-clinging interest. And the Dharma obtains only in the absence of self, absence of selfish interest.""

A student was asked, ""Master Zhaozhou, what is meditation?"" And Zhaozhou said, ""It's not meditation."" And the student says, ""What is it?"" And Zhaozhou said, ""It's alive.""

Hongzhi said, ""A person of the Way fundamentally does not dwell anywhere, takes no interest in anything."" So all of these teachings, all these teachers are really pointing at something.

Okay, you know what Daido Roshi is doing in that passage, which he would, you know, he repeated many times over the years—and it's very similar to what happens in the Heart Sutra—he's saying: ""Oh, you think it's this? No, it's not that. You think it's this? No, it's not that. You're going to settle down in this view? No, not that. Well, then it must be that. No, not that. But the teachings say—yeah, but not that."" A person of the Way fundamentally does not dwell anywhere.

So, shikantaza we think of as realizing oneself through the manifestation of that which you are practicing to realize. That's what Daido Roshi is pointing to when he says, when you sit in that moment, you are manifesting—but you're manifesting Buddha mind. And in shikantaza, we do that by putting nothing before you. In koan practice, the koan student does it by putting something before you and then realizing that you have not put anything in front of you.

One more and then we'll open this up. He says, ""Zazen is not a means to enlightenment; it is the complete action of the Buddha himself. Zazen itself is pure and natural enlightenment. This is the basis of Dogen's teachings: Practice and enlightenment are one. It's very easy for us to take for granted this simple practice we call zazen. It's easy to sit there thinking that counting the breath, following the breath, penetrating koan is what zazen is all about. But zazen is much more than this. Even beginners in their first moments of sitting are manifesting the life of the Buddha in their zazen. Having raised the body-mind to place yourself in the posture of zazen, the mind of enlightenment is in itself the manifestation of the life of Buddha. And with our zazen, we build confidence every day."" And he goes on from there.

So what I wanted to do was draw in some teachings of Hongzhi, which, as most of you know, are very poetic, sort of invoking images and imagery. And, you know, it's not didactic. It doesn't say, okay, do this, do this, do this, don't. But as a way of looking at: What does he describe? Why those images? What are those images evoking, and how can those images actually guide us, right? So it can be helpful and necessary at times to receive some degree of instruction, right? And there's also, as I said, a danger, a certain danger in that if we cling too tightly to that, right? Because ultimately, if we want to be a person of the Way, then we should not dwell anywhere.

Okay, so let me just pause first and see if—I know I just laid out a whole bunch of stuff. Let's see if there are any questions or comments.

---

**Question:** So when you said, and you mentioned a couple times, ""take no interest in anything,"" what came to my mind was, is that the same thing as curiosity without words? Because, you know, from the Western point of view, ""take no interest in anything"" is like the opposite of what we're taught.

**Response:** Well, that's why, you know, it's so important that, you know, who is the spokesperson of the Heart Sutra? Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion, who is speaking on behalf of the Buddha, but is very much engaged in the world in alleviating suffering. And so if she has realized that in its deepest state, that clearly is not leading her to a state of being passive or complacent or uncaring, right? So ""curiosity without words""... I don't know. I mean, I want to talk a little bit about the role of inquiry because in zazen—in the breath practice, for the most part, certainly in beginning years—there's no real... Usually there's—the focus is on developing our seat, right? It's on developing our mindfulness, settling the body, learning how to work with our karma, the consequences of our karma in terms of things that we don't like and we find difficult, working with emotions. And by working with, I don't mean engaging in a thoughtful, analytic way in the sense of we might do in other times, but working with through Dharma practice, you know, as an object that is arising in our meditation in a way that's described in the teachings.

So we're developing our capacity to be fully present and aware to all of the things that we would normally react to and get entangled in, because they keep coming, without getting entangled—which is not a small thing, right? At all. And that, as I said earlier, is, you know, goes hand-in-hand, is happening while and at the same time that things are calming. That's what allows us to be less reactive, right? To not get so entangled. We don't get so reactive and entangled because those things that are arising are not as strong as they were. And even as they do come back strongly, we're developing more of a ground, a basis of stability, of mindfulness, so that we're not so easily tipped over and get lost and lose our awareness, which means we can't—in those moments of being overwhelmed with it, we can't actually practice it. But we're sort of under the sway of it until our awareness returns.

So in the breath practice, that's what we're doing. That really all-important essential work that goes on, in a certain way, forever, you know, except in those increasing moments where the self isn't arising and the kleshas aren't manifesting and you're not entangled and there is nothing to react to. And so in the breath practice, it's mostly developing that. This can also depend on how a person's working with, how they're being guided, how long they sit with it. It can bring in inquiry. In koan study, koan study is a very explicit way of engaging in investigation right through the koan. The koan presents you with a question or something that needs to be resolved and resolved in a direct, experiential, non-conceptual way—in other words, to be realized. And that has its own strengths and possibilities and its own dangers. So there are very particular ways in which a student can get caught and trapped in koan work.

Shikantaza basically takes all that away. There is no object. And so there are different ways in which a person can get trapped and caught within shikantaza, okay? Because these practices are not something that's happening to us; we're bringing ourselves to them. And so to the degree that we are still dwelling somewhere, that we are entangled, we are still reacting, we will do all of those things in that particular form of zazen. That's all.

---

**Question:** Mike asks, ""If the realization of emptiness entails the cessation of meaning-making, I-making, mind-making, etc., how is this realization distinct—and I'm hoping it is—from an experience of vast meaninglessness? It certainly feels like the opposite of that.""

**Response:** Go back, I missed a word. How is it—what? How is this realization distinct from an experience of vast meaninglessness? Because meaninglessness is dwelling somewhere resolutely. It's really taking the position in the mind that nothing has any meaning. That's a very particular view, right? It's a perspective. It's a position that one can hold on to. It's a misunderstanding in a sense, and not clear even if there is some experience. Usually, it's more of a conceptual response to the teachings of emptiness, that if I experience emptiness, I imagine that to be something. And I imagine in that state the world to appear in a certain way, which results in ""nothing has any meaning anymore."" But that has nothing to do with the experience of emptiness. That's a whole lot of dwelling somewhere, right?

But it's an important question because that question has been raised since the time of the Buddha. That concern or that assumption that that's what emptiness will bring you. And so since the time of the Buddha, there have been an ongoing generation after generation response to that concern, that critic, or that doubt. And so if a person—and I encounter students and people who are sort of a little caught in that, you know, as they're practicing and letting go, sometimes they start to feel like, you know, where they're headed is ""nothing has any meaning, there's no purpose,"" right? But in those moments, they're really wandering away from actually practicing and they're getting more and more caught in thoughts about things, projections.

The Buddha said, ""Great is the gain of concentration when it is based in virtuous conduct. Great is the gain of wisdom when it is based in concentration."" Right? Again, how these three aspects of training work together. And then remember that when we're practicing, we're just—we're talking about zazen tonight. But we should never separate that from the Eightfold Path in our training, from the Eight Gates, from living a life within the Precepts, cultivating compassion, living with other people, being wholehearted, raising aspiration, working with difficulty. In other words, we're engaged in all of the affirming and life-giving aspects of Buddhadharma. And we're also engaging, when they arise, with all those sort of life-destroying or life-denying aspects of our self. And we're diminishing those and we're strengthening all the life-affirming aspects. And the stream that runs through all of that is zazen.

So zazen is not happening in isolation. It's happening within all of these different forms of practice and experiences and ways that we're being influenced and stimulated and reminded and brought back and motivated. Okay, so all of this is helping to both strengthen all of this and also keep things, in a certain way, in their proper place and keep them in a proper relationship with each other. Right? So it's whole. It's a whole path. It's a whole complete endeavor. And I think that helps to... That when we get into—and we sort of go down dark alleys in our practice, that's not happening in some way. That's not happening. Okay. We've kind of gotten caught up in a gully somewhere. Okay. So we need to find our way back.

---

**Question:** Thank you. Yeah. You spoke about not dwelling in a place—that's part of our zazen practice. And yet—and so I want to know something about the relationship between that sensibility of allowing things to flow and developing focus and concentration on a seemingly, like, an object such as the breath, for instance. Because in the beginning we look at it as an object, for sure. And then—so what is, like, a focus like that with—and not an object, but merging, maybe, or...?

**Response:** Yeah, yeah, that's a really good question. It's—and I think part of what is so beautiful about the Dharma and the teachings in practice is that, you know, when we come in and begin practicing, we just—we bring everything we are and have been to it. So we're going to keep doing the same thing within the practice of zazen. So we're going to bring our attention to the breath, and that is going to be an object to us, right? The practice that we're doing, we're going to keep assigning meaning to. ""This is good zazen. This is not good zazen. I'm a good practitioner. I'm not. This is a good thought. This is not a good thought."" I mean, is any of this unfamiliar to you? Right? That's why I wanted to start with that first part, you know, in which we designate something, we recognize something, we use language to describe it. And then, very importantly, as Bhikkhu Bodhi said, extremely important, we add meaning. You know, the teaching about not judging—that's the meaning. That's like pulling up to the meaning, you know, and filling it up. And that's where it gets complicated. Because once it means something, meaning is not something that just floats around out there in the void. It's meaning in relationship to me, myself. What does this mean about me? So when I'm having a gnarly or a nasty thought, or I'm angry as hell and I don't want to be, that that's threatening my sense of who I think I am, who I want to be. So we've got a problem, right? All that's happening is I am experiencing a certain kind of energy that's arising within me in a certain kind of way that I have learned and recognize and call anger. And once I name it, to me, it's filled—what that means to me is all there. And that's what I get entangled in. I'm not getting entangled in just the sensation. I'm getting caught in what it means to me, right? That's what I want to deny and push away, or that's what I want to hold on to. Because what this means to me is, ""I'm good. This is good. We are good.""

And so, coming back to your question, in every moment when we are calming, slowing down, suspending that response, when we do that, we're definitely—subject and object duality is very much present. But in every moment when I begin to not react that way, let go of that, soften that hard sense of boundary and sense, subject is beginning to soften. It's not so strong, right? I mean, when people begin to have an experience, like, you know, at the beginning of sesshin, you hate everybody. At the end of sesshin, you love everybody, right? They're the same people, right, as they were at the beginning. But some kind of boundary, right, hard boundary, is beginning to dissolve. And so that non—that sense of nonduality, which is a concept, is beginning to actually be experienced before we might even recognize it.

**Follow-up:** So does that come from the... I'm going to use the word, not the calming, but I'm sure that's part of it, like the actual focus and merging with the object so that it's no longer an object?

**Response:** Yeah. Okay, so again, remember, the samadhi has that aspect of calming, you know, the roiling energies, but also strengthens the natural capacity we have for a very strong, focused, penetrating concentration. Which means it's not dwelling. It's not—when you're using the word ""dwelling,"" to me, it feels more like making a world, you know, making a nest.

**Follow-up:** Well, but more simply, there's just me and the breath and we're there. You know, I am observing the breath. There's me and there's my breath, and sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. I bring it back. So there's a sense of subject and object. But the stronger, the more the mind calms and the stronger that concentration develops, that concentration, in a sense, seems to be bringing me into a more intimate experience of the breath, where that sense, that constant awareness of me, me, me and it, it, is beginning to drop away, as will time. You know, sounds, other experience through the senses will just sort of pass through. We don't open on them. And all of that that's softening are the ways in which that sort of strengthens and continually affirms the sense of me. And that...

Okay, let's do this. We'll take a break.

**(after break)**

This is from Hosui: ""It's my understanding that to expose our seeking mind, we need to look at the meaning beneath the words, not the words themselves or the objects they point to. And don't we have to use words and language to dismantle them? Is this correct understanding?""

**Response:** Well, I'm using a few tonight. Right. I'm not sure what you mean by ""dismantle,"" because that could be understood as, you know, through a kind of logical languaging process. I'm going to kind of deconstruct... Does she say anything more specific about the...?

**Follow-up:** No, I would say—and this gets more... Hosui? Is this Hosui? The first sentence, the first bit that I didn't read out: ""I would like to go back to the nature of words and language, which are how thoughts are expressed."" That's the bit that I like.

**Response:** So there's a different way—I mean, that can be helpful—but there's a different way of, you might say, analyzing or seeing into the nature of words and language, which is the more inquiry aspect of zazen, of meditation.

Okay, so let's take a little break, let's say about five minutes or so, and then we'll come back. And I want to bring up some of these passages from Hongzhi and relate them more specifically to shikantaza.

---

**(after break)**

This aspect in... I'm sorry, one of the distinctive aspects of Buddhist meditation is those three trainings: the sila, the samadhi, and prajna. So there's wisdom, but it's not just—it's inquiry. And so in the Theravada tradition, there's samadhi and there's vipassana, right? Which is usually translated as insight or clearly seeing and knowing. And so then the question becomes, well, how does that come about? So if a strong, focused concentration helps to bring forth a more penetrating mind, how does that bring about insight, given that that insight by its definition has to be nondual? In other words, there has to be the dropping away of not just concepts and meaning, but a sense of self, a sense of object, a sense of doing, striving, of accomplishing.

And so again, in the koan, that's part of the struggle: you're given an object and then the challenge is, now resolve that—you know, directly experience what that question is pointing to without holding on and turning it into something, much less cogitating on it.

Shikantaza doesn't give you anything. So normally when we speak of shikantaza, it's just awareness, just sitting, with a sort of emphatic ""just."" And so it's not constructing or discriminating. So it's, in a sense, the supreme practice of not doing, which is not passive, because passivity is just another form of doing. It is dwelling somewhere. At the same time, it's not exerting. So it's not passive. There is effort, but it's not exerting.

So when Huineng says don't contemplate the mind or purity, when Vimalakirti says take no interest... FYI, last I heard was ""take no interest.""

There you go. Take no interest. That's where they lost...

Oh, okay.

So, Dogen says, ""Be it known that for studying the way, the established means of investigation is a pursuit of the way. In seated meditation, the essential point..."" So he says that there is a practice of investigation. So we are investigating something, inquiring into something. And the essential point that distinguishes that particular kind of investigation is understanding that there is a practice of a Buddha that does not seek to make a Buddha. Since the practice of a Buddha is not to make a Buddha, this is the realization of the koan that in and of itself a seated Buddha does not interfere with making a Buddha.

So let me think of the images I often think of and have been helped by—the images that are often used in relating to shikantaza. A boundless sky, right? It's boundless because it is just sky. It's just empty space. It doesn't expand or contract. It is not something. And so it doesn't interfere with anything. It has no opinion. It doesn't get larger or smaller. Sometimes it seems to be—appears to be—filled with clouds, sometimes it seems to be bright and blue, but it's never not the sky. It doesn't discriminate. And so in a very real sense, we're returning or bringing the whole of one's being into that perfect state which we call Buddha, right? But it's not just a matter—it's not just enough to be in that state. There has to be—we have to realize it. So there has to be a shift, a subtle shift in the mind, where, as Dogen says, we make intimate contact with the unseen. And this is where words just—you know, we have to leave them. This is where the instruction, what we know, we have to leave behind, right? You have to go in alone.

That passage I think I spoke of last week—Dogen says, ""We should not value what is far away. Do not despise it, just become completely familiar with it. Do not despise what is near at hand and do not value it. Become completely familiar with it. Don't take the eyes lightly—and eyes here mean all, every sense—and don't give them weight. Don't overreach, don't add meaning, don't have an opinion. It's just become completely familiar with it. Make the eyes and ears sharp and clear."" That's basically it.

So now what? So let's look at a few passages from Hongzhi. I was reading an article recently of Zuise that she—I don't remember, it was in publication—and she quoted Yasutani Roshi on shikantaza, who said, ""Shikantaza is like sitting in the center of a clearing in the forest, knowing that ultimate danger is about to strike, but not knowing what form it will take or from what direction it will come."" If you look at his photograph on the Ancestors Hall, it's a little bit like this, I just imagine.

So, okay, but before the—the sentiment—just imagine yourself in that position. What state of mind are you in?

**Comment:** I mean, I understand that the response is that I'm awake and alert. But I feel like it's also true to say I would be, like, fearful and anxious. I don't know. I don't know how skillful I find that metaphor, that's all.

**Response:** Yeah, yeah, I acknowledge that. So I felt the same way. And I thought it was—it was just so evocative, stark. But that sense of, you know, imagining yourself in a place where you're not in danger, right? But that you're—there's a level of alertness that is not focused on any one place or one thing because it's spacious, right? So you're not looking here or there, right? Okay, so we'll just forget about that if it didn't work for you.

So, I'm just—these are separate passages of Hongzhi.

""Separate yourself from disturbance and face whatever appears before you."" Now, remember that translations are always translations, and sometimes they're quite accurate, and the language that's used—sometimes just in the translation, sometimes in the original—might sound like it's asking us to do something that we think isn't really what practice is about, like separating yourself, right? ""Separate yourself from disturbance."" So how might you understand that in a way that matches your understanding of what you're actually trying to do? Anyone want to take a shot at it?

**Comment:** Mirror. If I'm not separate from my disturbance, I'm identifying with my disturbance, so I can realize that there's a distance there.

**Response:** So you're saying—so then you are identifying with it, right? If I'm not separate from my disturbance, then I'm identified with my disturbance. But do you want to identify? Do you want to make it yourself? No, I don't. Right. So, but what do we want to do with disturbances? I mean, just on a basic level. In one sense, disturbance sounds like a kind of discernment. Well, let's just take it at face value. It's a disturbance. It's something that's disturbing. Yes. What are we—what are we trying not to do with it? React. Attach to it. Grab on to it, right? So here, you know, to not get tangled up in the translation—you're a practitioner, you know what to do. You don't want to get entangled. ""Separate"" here must mean not engage, right? Not to separate from a sense of distance, but from the sense of not grasping, okay? So then I can face that which is before me, because if I'm attaching to it, then that's what I'm facing.

""Not one iota seeps through from outside. The 2,000 forms have the same root and the 10,000 images have one substance."" So nothing is seeping through from the outside, right? So the mind is not establishing inside, outside—there is no boundary. Is there anything outside of the sky or space? It doesn't have a boundary. Everything has the same root. So you're meeting everything in that equality. When we judge things, things are not equal, right? Things immediately take a weight. Some are light, some are heavy. Everything equal means I am not responding, I'm not reacting to things from a place of judgment. I'm not adding meaning. As soon as there's meaning, there's going to be an inequality. And then everything has one substance. Everything—basically, now I'm experiencing things more in their nature, right? Because I'm not describing it. I'm not designating it as something. I'm aware, but I'm not distinguishing it from something else. There's just an open mind and something arising that is being—that is aware. There is awareness, and that's it. Just sit, just aware.

So what happens when you're sitting and your mind just impulsively reacts? You name it, you judge it, you grab onto it, you like it, you don't like it. So how do you continue to sit, separating yourself from disturbance and facing whatever appears before you?

**Comment:** I can't get that Yasutani Roshi out of my mind, because I—it feels like he's more alive in that moment, is what he's trying to describe. Because if you're walking through a forest or if you live in a forest or a jungle—I think that's left out—where if you're worried about the past or the present, your emotions, your thoughts, you're not aware of what you need to be aware—or maybe, put it, you're not alive, which keeps you alive.

**Response:** Okay, but what happens if you do become worried? How do you keep—huh? You're going to get eaten. You're not going to be aware of what's coming after you. But if you're practicing—so you're still practicing shikantaza, okay? And something has arisen. You are reacting. So how do you keep practicing shikantaza? What do you do with that reaction?

**Comment:** Let it go.

**Response:** In a sense, in shikantaza, generally speaking, in the breath practice, there's a more deliberate practice of seeing what we're grasping and letting it go, which really means I'm not clinging to it so that I can return my attention back to the breath, because that's where I want my mind to be. In order to return—redirect it back to the breath—I have to stop grasping that thought or that emotion. So that is letting go.

In shikantaza, we generally don't deliberately practice a letting go because that then becomes more deliberate. What we do is just keep doing shikantaza. You just maintain awareness. So something has arisen. It's just one phenomenon. And so you respond without—or you meet it without response, without loving or hating, giving it weight, making it light. But there's an impulsive reaction to that, and so you meet that without giving it weight, without making it light, without loving it, without... In other words, you just keep practicing the same thing. Nothing has changed. It's just that there's something else that has arisen. And that's difficult because those things mean something to us.

I know that for myself it was so significant in my own practice when I started to more and more—like, the teachings on not dwelling anywhere or not getting involved, not touching—I didn't realize how I was actively trying to not dwell and how I was actively trying to not touch.

**Question:** How was that problematic?

**Response:** Because what was an important shift was to see that that was more activity of the mind. In a sense, it was still the I, me, mine, designating, meaning-making mind. And that there was a way to practice relaxation. Which is why I would take issue with Yasutani Roshi's metaphor. Because for me, it was and continues to be like just seeing, like, oh, okay, I'm still doing. Okay. Oh, I'm still doing. Okay. And just kind of deepening into those layers of trust and release and relinquishment of that doing mind. And there is a non-doing practice and a non-dwelling practice that is the natural mind—the natural mind. And it's a relaxation. Yeah, it's a relaxation that's awake and that is not passive. But it's not so, I don't know, exerting. Yeah. Something, something.

And I think that is definitely, in a sense, a more developed and more developing and moving towards both a more natural integration, a more effortlessness. And I would also say that, you know, this is where, you know, zazen—letting go, for instance—doesn't have a fixed form. And so sometimes to be more deliberate in letting go, sometimes to be more firm even in letting go as a way to try and interrupt a cycle, sometimes to let go by not trying to let go but just, for a breath practice student, to just, in a sense, sit shikantaza and just allow that to be there, even if they might likely get pulled in. But they're no longer wrestling, because sometimes trying to let go just sets up a wrestling match, a kind of conflict. So just, you know, release that and just let it sort of expire itself. Sometimes earlier in practice, a student can work with that, in that way, rather than trying to be more deliberate about relaxing—I mean, letting go—just relax. Sometimes that just leads to, you know, just ongoing, you know, wandering mind.

And so I think that's where knowing that it's not a fixed thing, and that what is it you're trying to do—you know, we're trying—I mean, the Buddha said delusion arises from a self-clinging mind. It's the self-clinging and then the underlying view, the meaning, the self that is the basis of all of that. But it's that constant, and all the subtle levels and nuances and subtleties of the clinging that we're engaged in, that we're trying to free ourselves of. So I think it's good to be aware that there are various ways that we can actually engage in a clinging mind to move towards the release of that. And, you know, it's good to try not to get into a conflict with yourself, you know, you're fighting yourself, you're fighting your mind. I think much better than to just relax a little bit. And even if you just let your mind go a little bit, because when we get overwrought in our desire to let go, we oftentimes are just more, you know, tighter, clinging more tightly.

**Comment:** The question of how to—when something's already arisen, I tend to go towards trying not to create a story about what's arisen, but just feel the sensation. Just like, like there's karma arose, so just totally take in the sensations that's arising out of that, and let it kind of...

**Response:** You mean, tell like a narrative story, a historical story of why this is happening or...?

**Comment:** Yeah, to stay out of thoughts, get out of the thoughts and just feel the sensation. So stay within sensation, trying to do that, just experience the sensation when something has arisen.

**Response:** Yes. And do you find that easier, simpler, cleaner?

**Comment:** Yes.

**Response:** I mean, obviously I'm suggesting that you will. I mean, but that's important. You know, we can also learn by noticing when we get caught in the narrative. You know, there were many times where I would help myself by saying, ""This is my story. I am telling myself my story. This is the story I tell myself about me when I was..."" Because it helped me to create a separate—a little bit in a healthy way—and not be so entangled in. So it's just like, oh, this is just a story. It's not me. It's not the truth. It's not something I have to do anything about or with.

So he also says, another passage: ""Cast off completely your head and skin. Withdraw from distinction of light and shadow. Where the 10,000 changes do not reach is the foundation that even a thousand sages cannot transmit."" So again, we think about just the calming, the suspending, as Bhikkhu Bodhi says, the sort of deactivating. You know, it's like in the beginning, we're like wearing a suit that's filled with all these holes. And every time somebody throws a hook, right, there are a thousand different holes in which it can hook and we get caught, right? And it's like that fabric starts to become more seamless, so the hook is thrown and it doesn't land.

""Empty and desireless, cold and thin, simple and genuine—this is how to strike down and fold up the remaining habits of many lives."" You know, this kind of language can also be off-putting because it can kind of, in a way, suggest a kind of meaningless or a cut-off, dead, no emotions, no life. It's where sometimes when we chant ""free of passion, aggression, and prejudice,"" it's like, why not passion, right? So that's a word that has a very particular meaning in Buddhism. It means to be caught in overpowering emotions. It doesn't mean to be wholehearted about something. And so to be cold and thin doesn't mean be cold towards others and cut off from others, not caring. It means—think about cold, it's like the winter, right? Everything is falling, the leaves have fallen, there's very little, it's all quiet in the woods, there's very little activity, right? It's just—there's a kind of death, right, within a cycle of life. But there's a kind of death which is natural. And so in that way, it's a kind of spiritual dying to the incessant activity of our mind, to the incessant attachments of our clinging, to the constant arising of the self. It becomes cold and thin. Think of it in a positive way: it's lean, it's bare, simple, genuine, it's unadorned, unornamented, it's uncontrived. This is how to strike down and fold up the remaining habits of many lives. So, right, he's acknowledging we have these many, many habits, right, over—Buddhism—over many, many lives that we've accumulated. And we're just letting those become simple, right? Our stories are not simple. We do not tell simple stories about ourselves, right? Who's interested in a simple story, right? Why do people love soap operas? They are not simple, right? Shakespeare—I mean, it's like all the great stories are packed with samsara, right, and goodness. But what makes it really interesting, right, is the struggle with samsara. So here it's just think of just that quality of simplicity.

**Question:** Is it hard to trust that? Is it hard to trust that? Do you see yourself as in—when you begin to experience that, looking for something that's got a little bit more meat on the bone, a little bit more juice?

**Comment:** Yeah, I kind of feel guilty with that, trying to let my mind settle and like, shouldn't I be worrying about these things that are happening, and there are real things happening all the time. So it's kind of like, yeah, what am I doing by allowing my mind to settle? And so there is that kind of trust or faith necessary to be like, something has to stop at some point. I know that the worrying isn't going to take me, isn't going to help the situation, but it's kind of in that, like, crux moment that, yeah, that's, I guess, some form of letting go has to take place.

**Response:** Yeah, I think that's really such a big part of it. I know it has been for me, that there was a sense—it took me a long time to see that I felt not only justified, but I felt more important in my worry. Well, that meant I was caring about things. I wasn't not caring. I was worrying about them, which means I'm creating, you know, worry. And so in a way, it made me feel more important. And when I came here, it just got bigger, because now I'm really worried about important things, even more important, right? And so I feel more justified in sitting in zazen and continuing to do work practice in my mind, right? Because—and I thought, and I would actually think, you know, yes, I should be sitting, but, you know, this is my responsibility. I've been given this responsibility, I need to take care of this. And then one day I realized, no, your actual job at this moment is to sit. You know, that wasn't being responsible. I was fooling myself, you know, and so that helped me by seeing it more accurately and that what I was getting from it and what I was, you know, how I was not helping myself, but it was recognizing that not only was it not helpful to me, but it wasn't productive. Actually, I do remember when I was creating the program catalog many years ago—we used to produce that here—and I was—that was my job. And Daido wanted a Dharma wheel with eight spokes. And we only used PageMaker—do you remember PageMaker? And I could only make squares. And I thought, how am I going to make a wheel with spokes? And I was sitting in a—trying nothing, and then suddenly that's how it, like, all came together. It was so exciting. I thought, oh God, I can't—that was a hard session.

So maybe a couple more...

**Comment:** Oh, another—okay, kind of part—I guess I was curious about the meaning of meaninglessness or... 'cause it kind of flips back and forth for me of like, kind of—I get this ""take no interest"" as like, not valuing one thing over another, really just seeing all of it, but then also not just being, like, completely blind. And I almost feels like I have to take it to the point where it's like my body means nothing. Like my physical form could be sacrificed for anything or... You don't have to do that.

**Response:** No, and then try and work your way back. No, I don't think that's necessary. You know, this is one of the two extremes that the middle path is trying to free us of, and which in its extreme is a kind of annihilation, right? A nihilistic view, which is spoken of in different ways, but basically as within a life can be seen as a sort of extreme pointlessness or a lack of purpose or like, you know, ""if I wasn't here, nobody would even notice,"" you know, that kind of nihilistic view. So, you know, to just really trust that when you're practicing non-attachment, you know, and letting go, or even as you're clinging—because it's hard to let go, you know, it's not—it's persisting—if you can just keep aware that you're doing that. You know, like when I would tell myself, ""this is my story,"" sometimes I continue to tell the story, but it wasn't the same. It still had power, I was still reacting to it, but I was looking at it now from a little bit of a different perspective. It's like, you know, the river sweeping you downstream and you're completely underwater, you have no idea where you're going. Then you pop one eye up and you see, ""oh, I'm still sweeping down the river, but I'm seeing that happen."" It's not the same. It changes something. That's the power of mindfulness. We shouldn't underestimate the importance of that. And that then builds, you build on that, that gets stronger, it gets more stable, more persistent, okay? And that's really grounded in caring for yourself now. That's why the Buddha said the gain of a virtuous life, the gain to you and everyone around you, is that it will help you develop your concentration. The gain from that concentration for you and those around you is that it's going to help you, bring you more wisdom. Okay? You matter, right? And when you know that in a healthy way, in a good way, not an arrogant, self-clinging way, then that sense of yourself is good and it's felt as good, right? So that's a basic way in which we can offer ourselves, is the more we are really embodying our basic nature, other people are going to feel that as a positive thing, even if they don't have to be practitioners, you know, so it's good for everybody, right?

Maybe I'll end with this one. He says—well, this kind of goes with what I was just talking about—""Straightforwardly abandon strategies and really now take on responsibility. Having turned yourself around, accepting your situation, set your foot on the path and spiritual energy will marvelously transport you. Contact phenomena with total sincerity. Not a single atom of dust outside yourself.""

So abandoning strategies, now I can take on responsibility. When we, the monastics, shave our heads, we say, ""In the drifting, wandering world, it is very difficult to abandon our worldly ties. But this is the way I show my gratitude,"" right? As I shave my head, this is the way I—and as a sort of an action, a symbol, a way of embodying, cutting off something that is very easy to be attached to—my hair, my appearance, myself, my me. And it keeps growing back, right? So I have to keep—and this is the way I show my gratitude by doing that and trying to live that life. So which means I have to abandon all my strategies for keeping myself intact, keeping myself distant, keeping myself enclosed. So now I can actually take on responsibility, having turned myself around. Having turned yourself around, now we can accept our situation, we can accept the actual world we live in, the actual reality, even when it's a very painful one. Because what is the alternative to not accepting our situation? I just said it, right? It's not accepting the reality we have. Well then, where am I living? In a fantasy, in a place that doesn't exist. How can I take responsibility in that world? And in that, what surprises us is a spiritual energy marvelously, magically appears. We call that ki. That's one of the aspects of—a very important aspect of meditation—the gathering in, right? From all of our dispersing of all of our vital energies, gathering that in. It isn't just focused into a stream of concentration when we're sitting, but it's aliveness. When Zhaozhou says, ""Meditation is alive.""

So now we can contact phenomena with total sincerity, right? With truth. I mean, for me, that's one of the—I mean, there's many painful aspects about what's going on right now in our country and in the world. And one of them is the unabashed, blatant enshrining of a lack of sincerity, of a lack of truthfulness—just basic core human qualities that human life actually depends on. So contact phenomena with total sincerity. Not a single atom of dust outside.

So, you know, the thing about these forms of zazen—you have to work it out yourself. I mean, that's the good news. Sometimes it's the tough news. But think about it, you know, in every way that you discover, are discovering what this practice is, that's you, that's on you, right? It's not on anybody else. It's on you. You're doing that. You never leave that behind, right? No one ever has ownership over that. That's why that whole element of Buddhist practice is so important right there. With all of this, still it comes down to you, in your mind, in the quiet of your own space, working it out with a little bit of help and company.

Shugen Roshi is the head of the Mountains and Rivers Order and Abbot of the monastery. This talk, like all of our talks, is offered free of charge. If you would like to make a donation or find out more about our various programs, visit us online at zmm.org. Thank you for listening.

This is from Dogen's 300 Koan Shobogenzo. 

Against the Main Case:
Master Linji said to the assembly, ""There is a true person of no rank. This person goes in and out of your senses. Those who have not yet had realization—look, look!""

Daido Roshi's Commentary:
The true person of no rank is the real form of truth as it appears throughout the universe. It's fluid and in a constant state of becoming. The true person of rank is the real form of truth as it appears throughout the universe. It too is fluid and in a constant state of becoming. Rank and no rank are non-dual. Therefore, each and everything, up to and including each one of us, exists. Thus, the essence of all phenomena is thusness. The real nature of body and mind is thusness. Therefore, it cannot be attained by any personal effort, realized or not. It has always been manifesting as our very life itself.

Verse:
It is at once you, yet you are not. Must be understood in this way if you are to merge with suchness.

Good morning.

A true person of no rank. You know, let's remember that the koans, you know, with all of the teachings, the precepts, practices, they are pointing to the fundamental, which is this true person. The koans are always pointing to the fundamental. Whatever their appearance, however they express themselves, whatever is being brought into the koan is always pointing to the fundamental because the Buddha said, that's where we are liberated: True person.

A true here is to be free of contrivance, of falseness, of concepts. It can't be defined or limited by words, by history, by our perceptions. True means true to itself, in and of itself and in relationship to everything. True means in all times and places, without impurity or purity. The Buddha understood this before his enlightenment, that his liberation had to arise from something that was not a result of his own actions.

So Daido Roshi says it cannot be attained by any personal effort, because he understood that if any liberation that he might experience was a result of his effort, then it was impermanent because it was dependent upon that effort, and therefore it couldn't be fully liberating. And so he, in his enlightenment, talked about the unconditioned, the unborn, the undying, uncreated, unproduced.

And so then we all want to know, okay, so then, but what do I produce? What do I create? What do I give birth to? And what Daido Roshi is pointing to here is that we can live in harmony with this true person. That's the path—in our mind, in our awareness, in our body, in our words and thoughts. But most of us don't, and even as practitioners, we don't much of the time. That's what practice is about: directly realizing this true person and then harmonizing, integrating what Dogen spoke of as inner and outer. When we don't, that's what we call our delusion and samsara. We call it our pain and suffering. We call it our attachments and afflictions.

I was reading a book, an early sutra by the Buddha on Dependent Arising, which was translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, who is one of our Buddhist national treasures for having translated so many texts from the early teachings. And in his introduction, the way he talks about the self, I thought was interesting. He said once the notion ""I am""—so the Buddha said that's one of the primary ways in which the sense of self arises, just the sense that ""I am."" And he said, once that arises and comes into the focus of our awareness, then it is taken up as a theme for reflection. In other words, we reflect on it. Once the sense that ""I am"" comes into my mind, then it seems to be the most interesting thing of all, the biggest show in town. And so I want to look at that and reflect on it.

And yet, he says, it is found to contain a lurking ambiguity. For while the idea ""I"" is doubtlessly present as a signification of each experience, that sense of ""I am"" seems to be present in every experience I have. So it's hugely significant, but it seems to somehow be empty of any content. I can't find it. Ultimately, we realize that's because it is unfindable. It is not a thing, he says. Conceptually, then, it only appears in the negative. And yet it is a strange negative, for it proposes to be the essential purport of the entire experiential event. It's the irreplaceable center and support.

In other words, everything seems to depend upon it. In fact, the very notion of letting go of the self, of selflessness, of emptiness of the self, it's like, how is that possible? How could all of this be happening without the self? It is all happening without the self, always has been, always will, because there is no essential self—existing, permanent, autonomous, findable self.

He says, as soon as the notion ""I"" comes into view as the ubiquitous intention of every cognitive act, the self begins to seek a content, right? There's a demand for form and shape in the domain of concrete fact. In other words, I need to flesh it out so that there is something. And that's, of course, the story of our lives: fleshing that out, creating content, form and shape. He says that's what we call a personality view in Buddhism.

And he says then we begin to speculate. And of course, a lot of this is happening outside of our conscious awareness. You know, it's not like at some point in our early development, it's like, oh my God, I am, but what is that? So let me go fill it in with some content. We don't. That doesn't matter. We don't think like that. But when we think about, as a young person, creating a sense of self, I mean, we talk about that. That's what young people do. That's like part of the job is formulating a sense of the individual, which is not a bad thing, but it gets interfused with a lot of ideas.

So he says, so then we start to speculate. And one of the ways Buddhism teaches that we speculate is about its future. It's like, okay, well, where's—how does this all end up? And so in Buddhism, it says, Buddhism teaches it's either eternal—the sense of self is eternal, right, and we can take some comfort in that, or a nihilistic view, it doesn't exist, that at death it's just over, done, nothing more to it. And the Buddha rejected both of those as just another duality.

And Bhikkhu Bodhi says this activity of conceiving, of speculating, is based on three basic functions. One is craving, our desire. The other is conceit, which is the sense of—we think of it as being conceited, egoistic, which it is in a way, but it's really based in just the sense of ""I am."" And then our views.

He says, under the influence of craving, the self comes to expression in thoughts of longing and desire. That's how craving shows up—what we want. Under the influence of conceit, it becomes manifest in judgments and comparisons, whereby we rank ourselves in relation to others: superior, equal, inferior. And under the influence of views, which is a theoretical bent of thought, the ego bias issues in dogmas, tenets and speculations concerning the reality and nature of the personal self and its locus, the world.

So longing and desire, the sense judgments, comparisons, ranking and dogmas—seeing any of this going around lately? So ""I am"" basically shows up as the center of every experience, the most significant thing, in a sense, which is why being selfless or caring for others is a spiritual virtue, and I think virtually all of the great religions, because it's a going-beyond, a transcending or suspension or somehow not getting overly caught in that sense of ""I am."" And so it can be a moral, have a moral sort of imperative associated with it, can be just a religious teaching—it's a good thing to do, it's a good way of being. That is true. But in Buddhism, it's based in the actual reality. It's not just a moral principle. In fact, in Buddhism, there is no moral principle that's separate from the reality of things.

The whole of the Buddha's teaching, the whole of the Buddha's life, was based on his actual direct experience of the way things are. And then the teachings were how to express both that reality and then how to live in accord with it.

So what is this self? Where is it? I think, I feel, I taste, I touch, I love, I hate. But where is this self? And so, as he says, we seek to fill in the gaps. I want to feel good, I don't want to feel bad. My craving. I am the one who wants, who seeks, who wants to free myself of delusion, who wants to meditate and gain enlightenment. And what does this all mean? What do I believe? How do I see the world? What is true and not true?

And what the Buddha realized is that these views, these beliefs are not just sort of floating around, you know, you pick one up off the shelf because it's attractive. When you don't like it anymore, you put it back and get another one. If it were that easy. But they're arising from and completely interdependent with our sense of ourself. That's why all of these are connected, so intimately connected. The craving arises out of a sense of ""I am,"" I am the one who's craving. The basis of what I crave for is based in my view, what's going to give me what I want.

That's why practice is so challenging, right? You know, it's not just a matter of letting go of something that we're holding on to, although that is an essential part of the practice, but it's going to that very deep basis that is within everything. So we're invested. In short, we're invested. We're invested in our craving. We're invested in our sense of self. We're invested in our views, which is why when they're challenged, we don't like that, right?

So that's why we sort of tend to impulsively act defensively. Something is being threatened. It's not just that you have offered some helpful criticism—my self experiences that as a direct threat. And so when we begin to be aware of this, some of us will just double down—double down on the program, double down on the self, crave more, make ""I"" larger, make more rigid and dogmatic the views. Don't let anything in that would threaten that. Seeing any of that going around?

And of course, throughout our lives, our world, our society, the world presents us with various ways to do all of this, and also to, at every step along the way, rank ourselves. Where do we stand? What's our position? How do we line up? Who's in front, who's behind?

I've read that in the, you know, pre—going back a long time—that a village chief, that their primary responsibility was to make sure everybody else was okay. And in times when things were not plentiful, that their job was to make sure everybody had enough, and they would go without if need be. But once cultivated agriculture came onto the scene and people learned to grow and grow surplus so that they could store things for times when times were wanting, that was great, right? A revolution. But then those surpluses had to be stored somewhere, right? Who's got the key? And historians actually sort of recognize, as I understand it, that is the beginning of that differential of power where the village chief went from being equal and sometimes having less than, to being the one with the power. Seeing any of that going around?

So are you in or out? And if you're in, where do you stand? Where do you rank? Based on what standard of measurement? We don't lack for various units of measurement in this department.

The Buddha said that there—another way of looking at it—is that there are eight worldly concerns. Do you have happiness or are you suffering? Are you famous or are you insignificant? Are you being praised or blamed? Are you gaining or losing? We can live our lives basically in a race. And the Buddha said, whatever those units of measurement, whatever the view, whatever the craving, whatever the sense of ""I am,"" they're all impermanent. When we rely on those for any kind of lasting, ongoing, deep, sustained happiness, contentment, fulfillment, he said, you will not succeed—not because you're not trying, but because it is based on a wrong view. It's based on something that is not true.

So that's why in the beginning of zazen instruction, one of the—I mean, you know, it's like if we could appreciate how when we're just getting instruction in zazen, the earth should start quaking, right? The rafters should start splitting, right? That we're actually hearing, being, receiving a radical, revolutionary way of being that is also primordial, the most natural, accessible, kind thing that's happening. We usually don't quite see it all that way yet, but one of the things that's taught is to, when things arise, do not judge them, try not to judge them. Don't create a rank—this is good, this is bad, this is right, this is wrong, this should be, this shouldn't be. Craving, ""I am,"" view are all being brought forth in that moment of judging. I decide what's right and wrong. I am the one who likes or doesn't like this, and it is based on what I think, what I believe.

And all the while, there is a true person of no rank, free of that, not bound, that goes in and out of our senses. And because of that, it appears like there's someone seeing, hearing, thinking, tasting. There is seeing, hearing, thinking, tasting. There's just no ""I am"" in all of that. The Buddha said, there is just seeing, there is just hearing. That's the reality. And when we realize that, then we are freed of that centerpiece that we cling to, that we build up, that gets threatened, that is discouraged, that is insecure, that is fearful.

Dogen said we should make concentrated effort to understand this in detail. Rather than love the carved dragon, we should go on to love the real dragon. So the dragon in Buddhism is an enlightened being. That's why we have one at the front door. And that dragon flies, she swims, she walks, she has all kinds of ways of being. So Dogen is saying, love the real dragon, not the carved one, not the one that we make up, not the contrived one, but the true person. Love that one rather than the carved one. But then he goes on to say, but we should learn that both the carved and the real dragons have the ability to produce clouds and rain to bring life to the earth.

Daido Roshi says the true person of no rank is the real form of truth. He says the true person of rank is the real form of truth—a real dragon and a carved dragon. But if the true person of no rank is everyone's nature, is your nature—you brought it here with you, it was your true nature before you ever heard of Buddhism, it's true whether you're thinking about it or not, whether you care or not—but if that's so, then why isn't it obvious to everyone? Why aren't we all living our lives as the real dragon, as a true person?

The true person of rank, he says, is also the real form of truth as it appears throughout the universe. But if that's true, then in this sense of self, then why do we get so caught? If that is also a real form of truth, why do we get so easily seduced by things, entangled? Why, why, why? It's not that that's irrelevant. Buddhism looks very, very deeply and profoundly into the causation of things. But we can understand why and still be caught. We can see ourselves turning away from something or grabbing onto something, know from our own experience that that's not helpful, and still turn away and still grab on.

And that's why we practice. Because that awareness alone is not enough, right? I can be aware that I am judging and continue to judge. I can be aware that I'm attaching and continue to attach. But even in that, that awareness is a slighter, a smaller, in a sense, a weaker awareness. If I was truly aware...

Dogen goes on to say, just simply don't value what's far away, but don't despise it either. Just be completely familiar with it. So the gate of zazen, the first gate of training—this is what Dogen is giving us instruction in. Don't value what's far away over there, but don't despise it. Just be completely familiar with it. See it clearly. He said, don't despise what is near at hand, and don't value it either. Become completely familiar with that too. See it as it is. Don't take your eyes lightly, but don't give them weight. Don't take what you see lightly. Don't ignore it. Don't deny, don't avoid, don't disregard, but don't give it undue weight. Do not give way to the ears and do not take them lightly. Make your eyes and ears clear and sharp.

I think this is one of the most beautiful, exquisite, succinct teachings of zazen. Dogen says, sit and see for yourself. Interrupt that mindstream. Let go of the attachments. Verify—it's an essential part of Buddhist practice. The teachings are offered and then everyone turns and goes to their seat and you verify: Is this true? Like, how do I know if attachments... Maybe attachments are great. Maybe these guys have it wrong. So that's valid. So observe. See for yourself.

Daido Roshi says, the essence of all phenomena is thusness. What is that? The real nature of body and mind. And that's why he says that in order to understand thusness, we have to realize both the person of no rank and the person of rank—emptiness and form. This is the great, profound teaching and liberation and sort of challenge of Buddhist practice.

You know, if Buddhism said, look, you're holding on to this and it's not helping, let go of that and come over here and hold on to this, we'd all be there, right? When we chanted the Heart Sutra, a whole lot of no's: no eye, no ear, no toe—no toes. Yeah, it's true. No toes—they're there by implication, right? All of those things. Every time, it's like, okay, I'll let go of this. But it's like, no, well, no, no, there's something there. There is a rank, there is a form, there is a body, there are toes, there's smelling, there's hearing, there's thinking, there's being born, there's living, there's dying. Nagarjuna said, yes, there is something there, but what's the nature of it? That's where we get entangled.

And so we aspire to realize this true person of no rank without creating an idea of the true person, an idea or an expectation or a hope or a dream. And of course, we do create those ideas. Every once in a while, somebody will come and they'll come in dokusan and they say, ""I have no expectations of anything."" And I was like, come on, can we be honest here? And that's not a problem, right? I mean, we've been doing it all our lives. Why would we stop when we walk in the front door? But when we encounter those in our practice, can we yield and turn towards what is true? That's the challenge. And you will know, because the evidence will come back to you. Not yielding will bring certain consequences. It will be difficult.

Dogen says in Bendowa: sit upright. Practicing Zen is the authentic gate to free yourself in the unconfined realm of this samadhi, this true person. And although this inconceivable Dharma is abundant in every person, this true person is the real form of truth that appears throughout the universe. It's fluid, constant state of becoming. It's your Buddha nature. He said, although that is true, it is not actualized without practice, and it is not experienced without realization. He said, all Buddhas continuously abide in this Dharma and leave no traces of consciousness where they are.

The traces we leave, right, is what we do. That is like the brick and mortar of samsara, the traces we leave on each other. We cannot contain ourselves. We spill out. I talked about this on Friday night. So I talked about it in terms of influence. We may seem insignificant in and of ourselves, but we have influence, right? We spill out. Can we do that in the best way possible? Can our persons, the person of rank, when we come together, can we do that in the most harmonious way possible?

I've always thought, for a long time, I've thought that a Buddhist sangha is like an ongoing experiment and testimony to the fact that we can actually live together. We can do this, but we need guidance. We need guidelines. We need a way, right? We need a way to... we need... what do we aspire to? Like, what do we need to be doing and cultivating and strengthening in order to be able to live together? And then what do we do in those moments when we're not doing that very well? How do we take responsibility for that? How do we understand that so we don't keep repeating that? How do we repair that?

I had a conversation with Chozen Roshi recently. By the way, we were talking recently at programming meeting about our 45th anniversary. We're in our 45th year—cause for celebration. And we're going to have a celebration in October. And the idea came up: Wouldn't it be wonderful if she was able to come? She is Daido Roshi's Dharma sibling. They trained together in Los Angeles. She established the Great Vow Monastery in the northwest U.S., which is one of the only, very few Zen training monasteries in the U.S. She is a dear friend and our elder. I love her deeply and I speak with her as frequently as I can because she is my elder.

We were talking, and then afterwards we had this idea of inviting her. So I invited her and I gave her all kinds of outs because I thought, she's turning 80, she travels a lot, she's trying to slow down. And I said, look, we would love for you to do this, but I understand if you can't make it. And she wrote right back and said, ""When do you want me to be there? Good news,"" she said, ""and just tell me what to do."" And she sent me a little video clip of a rabbi who was talking about how you can be in the world as a thermometer or a thermostat.

If you're a thermometer, then your temperature is constantly rising and falling, depending on what's going on around you, right? So you're always subject and at the beck and call of whatever the temperature is in the room. Or you can be a thermostat—you set the temperature. You decide how you want to be in this space, how you want to be in this room.

When we don't understand... When we don't understand... And Buddhism is a path and teachings and practice to gain understanding about ourself and phenomena, ourself and the world. And the fundamental teaching is that it is in a constant state of mutual arising. We arise together, everything—nothing arises by itself. That means we are inextricably bound to each other, to everything, in the sense of dependent—not casually bound, but in a state of profound existential dependence. That's the way the world works, naturally.

If that's the fundamental nature of things, when something is able to not act in accord with that, there are going to be problems. When we don't understand that we are ceaselessly creating our own experience of this world and each other and take it to be true and an objective reality, we don't see that our mind—filled with memories and associations and views and cravings and a sense of self, which, you know, let's just acknowledge that all of that is created unwittingly, I mean, for the most part. I mean, we do a lot to create our sense of ourself, but we do that, you know, just a sense of how to be in the world.

And again, Buddhism says that's not a problem. It's the belief that that is something permanent, something fixed, that a view—even if it's true, if you attach to it, it becomes dogmatic. And now it's not true anymore. Something that is good has now become something that is harmful. It's fine. It's not the... The harm, in my hands, in my mind, is the source of the harm.

And in that state, it makes sense to blame everybody else for my unhappiness, for my fear, for my insecurity. The more I'm estranged from my own humanity, from my emotions, from my pain, from my ability to tolerate discomfort, the harder it will be for me to have empathy for others. If I'm cut off from myself, then I'm going to be cut off from others. Anger and hatred will seem justifiable, necessary. And with our capacity for creating views, we can justify that in a way that may seem logically true and may garner much support—and is a deception.

And in that, we can choose again and again and again to cause harm, to be miserable, to bring misery on others, and think that is right and justified and necessary. And isn't that what everybody's doing?

And so, in a sense, when we come into practice—I was talking about somebody with somebody earlier—you know, I've often thought that I think all of us come into practice a little bit numb. You know, it's available and kind of a short-term, superficially effective salve in a difficult world, in a life where there are—where there's pain, just numb it down a bit. And when that starts changing, right, when we start opening our hearts and developing the capacity for our hearts to be open and to actually turn towards that pain in a way, it gets a little harder, right? And now we can see, oh, you know, yeah, it was easier when I was numb. Was it, actually? Was that easier? And there's a point at which it's just kind of too late for that anymore. Thank you very much. You've seen too much, you know more.

And in a sense, I think that's part of the path, is being able to hold that, bear that, be patient within that. And as we carry that, and as we're practicing, it changes our capacity to hold that, our capacity to bear it. Not just because we develop an internal, thicker lining, but because it gets lighter the more we understand it's not fixed, it's not something, it's not necessary. It's not you. Your pain, your fear, your distress, your hopelessness, your insecurity is not you. It brings forth craving, it definitely brings forth a sense of self, and it is definitely based on a view, but it's not you. And that's where practice occurs.

When we see that we have the power to both create our unhappiness, and then we watch ourselves doing that—and I think we tend to watch ourselves doing that for quite a while until we start to say, maybe not, no more, I don't need this—then that impulse to blame or to externalize or to feel justified is just really wasteful energy, a wasteful expenditure of this precious life. It doesn't taste good anymore.

You know, that's the challenge—is for a long time, the poison, in a sense, tastes good. So it keeps having an appeal. That's why it's hard not to keep going back. But there's a certain point where it just doesn't taste good anymore. And when we begin to take real responsibility, even things that are difficult are lighter, easier to hold. And it takes time, you know, and we live in a society that doesn't have time for anything except greed, anger and delusion. And so that's, you know, just a good thing to know. We could put that on the front door: It takes time, but what else are you going to do with your life?

So as Daido Roshi says, realized or not, it has always been manifesting as our very life itself. It is at once you, but you're not it. This world, this person of rank, this pain, this unhappiness, this expectation—it is. It wants you, but you're not it. To see it in this way, you merge with suchness, with the true person.

So those of you who've joined us for the weekend, thank you for your effort and throwing yourself into it. Many of you I spoke with had real questions and real concerns, things going on in your life. Buddhism doesn't tell you what to do. It doesn't answer your question in terms of do you turn left or do you turn right, do you stay in? That's up for each of us. But it gives you an open window into not just you, but everyone.

So please, whatever brought you here, keep putting fuel on that fire. Don't let it go out.

I'll end with a poem:

The brilliant jewel belongs to the Dragon of Wisdom.  
Enter the cave, pass through the gate, take your seat.  
It has been here waiting for you.  
Come or go as you will, it will never abandon you.  
Traces of winter, snow and ice remain,  
the morning air still chill,  
yet all of creation murmurs of a coming spring.

Master Dogen taught: Today, where the clouds are smiling and when the snow's will is bright over the mountains and forests are spring, wind and rain. At this very time—how is it? He paused and then said, Do not say that someone holds the handle of creation. The causes and conditions for proceeding on the way give rise to good karmic roots.

There is an ancient cycle of seasons. Winter gives way to spring, spring to summer. Youth gives rise to old age, birth to death, delusion to enlightenment. And this cycle of training, of practice periods—from the winter training period, which is lighter, to ango in the spring, and then to summer again, which is lighter, and then to fall—has been going on here since the beginning, 45 years, and in the Zen tradition for hundreds of years, and in different forms all the way back to the Buddha.

Dogen in the Shobo Genzo has one of his longest fascicles, which is called ""The Practice Period,"" about ango. And it has different sections, but he talks about how, and this was at this time exclusively monastic practice. So you have to think about that time—so this is the 1200s, and this is having been brought over from China—how monastics during the year lived in monasteries or temples, or they were on pilgrimage, and that during these practice periods they would gather at different significant training monasteries. He talks about how they were asked to come at least two weeks before the ango came, so they could get settled in. So you imagine all of these monastics arriving.

I just spoke with Chosen Roshi this week, and she was telling me about a pilgrimage trip she recently made to China. She said they went to the monastery of Chijiang, where Dogen went and studied with his teacher on Tiantong Mountain. And that at the time Dogen was there, it had 900 cells for monastics, and now it's been reduced to 600. So imagine—not all of those, I'm sure, were doing the ango training, but many of them were. He talks about how they would all be assembling, greeting each other, seeing old friends, monastics that came from similar parts of China. Just imagine this gathering, the energy of that, all arriving and entering into a cloister. During the ango, there was no more coming and going.

And then there were lots of ceremonies—tea ceremonies, a very elaborate beginning, a scroll—very similar. Dogen lays it out in terms of how that should be constructed. In our way, we have been maintaining this very ancient tradition. There is something, I think, very comforting, a sense of stability in these cycles that arise—natural cycles, earth cycles, practice cycles—that at their best are, of course, ways to train and awaken, but create a sense of stability, particularly in a world and in times where there seems so little stability. There’s a continuity—a continuity of practice, a continuity of sangha practicing together, of training, of dharma.

At times when it seems like everything else is up for grabs, everything else is fragmented, scattered, or things are falling apart or being taken apart, there are some things that have a kind of universal quality: human goodness, human nature, the potential for kindness, generosity. Those don't get extinguished. And so in that way, I feel like ango helps us, serves us in multiple ways.

Of course, one of the challenges in its cyclical nature is that every time this comes around, we enter into ango again for the first time. We have to make it anew. We have to create it anew so that we're not just doing what we have done before. We're not just doing it because we have done it before. We're doing something that is alive and awake. Life seeks life. As human beings, we don't want just to live or to have lived; we want to be alive. Don't you think that's true? We want to be alive.

One of the worst illnesses of all is to feel like we are living, but living without being alive. In Buddhism, we understand this as being unfettered, unbound—to enter into and realize our expansive, unbound nature and to have a deep sense of not just being part of this world, but being the world. There's this ancient, universal sense within humanity that somehow we are inextricably bound in this world in a way that is wondrous.

Last week I talked about taking refuge, mutual affinity, and interaction. The Buddha said, in order to be alive, we have to free ourselves—self-clinging, false views and, what do we chant? To be free from clinging, we must be free from greed. The function of greed is not to bring us happiness. In Buddhist understanding, the function of greed is actually to create suffering. That's its function; that's what it does.

And so, to be free from greed, we have to actually want to be free from suffering, which would seem easy. Who wouldn't want to be? And yet we fight that. As Shantideva said, we go back again and again to the causes of our suffering because it's a habit. Buddhism says, to be free from suffering, we have to be willing to give up some of the activities of our thoughts and words and actions, some of the mental states—Buddhism calls them mental factors: anger, resentment, spite, jealousy, arrogance, cruelty, faithlessness, laziness, heedlessness, forgetfulness, distraction.

In short, to be free from suffering, we have to be free from self-clinging and false views. All of those mental factors arise from that. Shorter still, what this means is we have to train. We have to train to be free of those things. Wanting to be free of them is good, but it's not enough. And you know that. We know that. That's something that we come to understand pretty quickly, I hope, in dharma practice—that wanting is important, but it's not enough.

So, ango—peaceful dwelling—begins with the great ocean gathering of the sangha. And so Daido Roshi, years ago, wanted to ensure that we had the greatest ocean gathering possible. So rather than being exclusively monastic, which in those early years would have been an ango of one, basically, or two, the whole sangha, of course, needs to be part of this; otherwise, it's not going to be ango.

In that fascicle, Dogen says everyone from the chief disciple on down makes three prostrations to each other and says: ""On this occasion, we are fortunate to spend this practice period together. We fear our karma might not be good, and we beg your compassion.""

In other words, as we begin this ango, I fear that there might be times when my thoughts, my words, and my actions are not in your best interest, are not kind, are not compassionate—that I might speak or think or act out of my anger, my resentment—and in advance I ask for your compassion as I aspire to do my best. We do that together because we take refuge in the sangha, which means we rely on each other, and we rely on each other to be sincere.

That's one of the basic, sort of implicit, underlying views, ideas, beliefs, agreements, we might say, in training together: that come what may, we are going to do our best. We're going to take the dharma seriously. We're going to take seriously our capacity to practice the dharma. We're going to acknowledge our capacity to forget, to misspeak, to misstep, to indulge, to have self-clinging, to act out of our false fears. We have to acknowledge that, otherwise we're beginning in blindness.

And at the same time, we're pledging ourselves to do everything we can to free ourselves of those forms of bondage. And we're going to do that for ourselves and for each other, and when we stumble, we're going to try our best to respond to each other with compassion. In that way, we stand up together, we carry each other together as we are taking responsibility for ourselves. Because our lives and our bodies and minds and our intention and aspirations—they're all mingling. That's what happens in a sangha. That's what happens in any relationship. Our minds are mingling with each other, intermingling. And so then, don't we want that mingling to be as the best it can be?

The theme for this ango is the Eight Gates. So in celebration of our 45th anniversary, I thought about that—what would be nice to do, what would be appropriate, having in mind our 50th, which will be a bigger deal because it's 50, right? That's a magic number. And so we'll deal with that when we get there. But I thought the Eight Gates would be a really nice way to frame this ango.

So one of the texts that everyone's encouraged to read, probably reread, is the Eight Gates of Zen, which was at its time really significant. It was the first really significant text that Daido Roshi wrote because it was what he called a training manual. It was sort of a description of what he had dedicated himself to creating—not out of thin air, drawing from this ancient tradition, but articulating that and articulating that for us at that time. This is going back quite a number of years, decades, at a time when Buddhism was still barely out of the womb. It wasn't like it is today at all, right? Of course, there was no Internet, there were very few centers, it was very hard to find out about Buddhism. Most of the centers were fledglings, like barely having tested their wings. They were—so each teacher in every center was establishing and trying to formulate: What is training going to be? What is it and what is it going to be? So it was really a very significant moment for us in this sangha, in this text.

In rereading it, you will feel at different points in different sections where it's dated, right? Sometimes because of the language being used, sometimes because you'll see the various ways in which the training here and the sangha and different aspects of us have evolved, right? So you'll see that when you read that. Just keep that in mind.

But in that, Daido Roshi says—and part of that dating, remember, is that he was speaking in a different time and he was really teaching and trying to help. You know, the norm was when people came for an introductory retreat, which we did every month, most of the people who came would know next to nothing about Buddhism. That was the norm. Now, when we do those retreats, that is more of an exception. Most people coming in have certainly studied about Buddhism—not always, but most—studied, oftentimes are meditating, oftentimes have been practicing at other centers. Very different landscape than it was then. So that's also important to keep in mind in terms of this book.

But he said any training matrix that wants to maintain the integrity of the Zen tradition and address these diverse needs of a sangha at that particular time must provide training in liturgy, practicing at home, the moral and ethical teachings, koans, advanced methods of meditation, the arts of Zen, Buddhist study, physical labor, the connection between mind and body, the unique teacher-student relationship that exists in the Zen tradition, and the development of a different kind of learning process that is not linear and sequential, but rather direct and intuitive. Any training matrix that wants to maintain the integrity of Zen—well, he's also just described this place, what he was developing, and what the Eight Gates of Zen is all about.

He goes on to say how the first 12 years of Zen Mountain Monastery involved an exploration of how to develop, how to create and refine this training program. He had trained mostly with Maezumi Roshi at the Zen Center of Los Angeles, but what he was trying to do here was different. He wanted to create a monastery, which ZCLA was not. And so he studied, he spent a lot of time studying the monastic traditions of Buddhism, going back to the Buddha, and then the Chan tradition in China, and then in Japan. He also studied Western forms of Buddhism. We formed a very nice relationship with Holy Cross Monastery down on the Hudson towards Poughkeepsie, because they had gone through their own process of developing their form of monastic practice within the United States. He used to go down there and do retreats. We had monks and nuns from their convent, sister convent, come here and practice. Some of them became students. We studied their book—the monks studied their text which described their evolution of their monastic training. So he was really working at drawing from tradition and then articulating that into our own context here.

An important part of that was teaching about these different forms of practice, right? That's why I thought it would be good for us to focus on these, because we've been just practicing them, sort of immersed in them—it's just what we do. In the earlier years, I spent a lot of time in talks and in mondo, retreats, speaking specifically to what is zazen, what is it to study with a teacher, what is art practice, what is body practice. At a certain point, he didn't need to do that so much because it had been sort of integrated into the training. But I thought it would be a good time to bring that back up and just make it a little bit more conscious, give us an opportunity to speak about that again now.

Zazen, he says—and some of you will remember this—it's not meditation, it's not contemplation, it's not visualization or mindfulness, it's not found in the mudra, the chakra, the mantra, the koan. It's not revealed in words and letters and is only transmitted person-to-person, Buddha-to-Buddha. He would have this kind of litany, almost a rant, of all the things it was not. He was trying to make clear that it's something that is alive. It can't be reduced to this element or this aspect or this characteristic. It's more spacious than that, more dynamic than that.

He called Zen study, spoke of that in terms of training with a student and teacher training. He said, ""My teacher meeting me is my teacher meeting themself, and it is me meeting myself. Isn't this the Buddha meeting the Buddha again?"" Because we can reduce each of these areas of training to just ""study with the teacher, that's what it is. You go into dokusan or daisan, you ask a question, the teacher responds, isn't that what it is?"" And then he was trying to convey—there's, and he speaks about it in the Eight Gates, is unique. There's something unique about that particular relationship. What is its purpose? What is the teacher's role? What is the student's role? How, as students, do we train? Do we study the dharma with a teacher? You know, all through the many, many years that I stayed with my teacher, I never went into dokusan casually, ever. I was always sitting on the edge of my seat. For a lot of years, that was anxiety and feeling intimidated, but then it got better.

He speaks about liturgy: All of Zen's rites and rituals are constantly pointing to the same place, to the realization of no separation between the self and the ten thousand things. Liturgy uncovers the truth which is the life of each one of us—something that is alive, dynamic. It can't be reduced to a rite or a ritual, but we use them because they have so much potential.

The precepts—he was very, very passionate about the importance of the moral teachings. Wisdom without compassion, he would say, cannot be yet true wisdom. Compassion without wisdom can't be true compassion. The interpenetration of selflessness with action—compassionate action. Prajna paramita is the great mantra, the unsurpassable mantra.

Art practice: In the early years it was important. As he got older, towards the latter part of his years, his teaching became more and more focused on art practice. He really was an artist in the sense that it was just the way he saw the world. He was always photographing, he was always working in that way. Just part of who he was.

Body practice: It's interesting. One of the things that always impressed me about Daido Roshi was his capacity to really examine and teach something with great conviction and confidence and passion without necessarily having experienced it in the way that he was teaching it. For instance, establishing a monastery—he had grown up as a Catholic boy, he had been trained by Jesuits, so his living experience was, you know, sort of mingling with monks and nuns. But his training experience was not in a monastery, and yet he wanted to build a monastery. And I thought that's, you know, that's a lot of something. And also with body practice—in terms of more overt forms of body practice—I remember at one point he got a gun and he started doing target practice. And we were like, ""What?"" And he said, ""That's my body practice."" We were like, ""I'm not going to tell anybody about this."" It was a short-lived thing. I don't know what that was ever about, really.

Work practice: He was very passionate about work practice, the importance of work practice. In fact, for a later time, but he would always—whenever he saw, if he walked out and he saw shovels left out in the rain, right, or tools not being taken care of, he would bring that right in and talk about, ""This is no different, right, than a stick of incense. Bowing to a tool is like bowing to the Buddha."" He very much wanted us to understand the sacred activity of work. He says it's the foundation of mindfulness, a state of consciousness in which the body is relaxed, senses are alert, mind is clear and focused.

And so during the ango, we're going to be doing some mundos. We won't do mundos on all of the Eight Gates. I'm going to do one next week. The first one I'm going to do—the first two will be on zazen. The first one I want to focus on shikantaza, second will focus on koans. Shoan Osho and Gokan Osho are also going to do mundo on one of the Eight Gates, and then we'll be speaking about them, incorporating them into other talks and teachings.

The ango intensive that I'll be leading later in the ango, I wanted to do something that was drawing on the Eight Gates. I wanted to bring together liturgy and morality—precepts, compassion, cultivating compassion—and the sacred activity of work, and to look at how, because Daido Roshi would talk about, and I think this is very important, the interpenetration of these different forms of practice, right? When we speak about them, it's work practice is over there and liturgy is over here and zazen is over there, and each one has its own space and has its own sort of language. But he said, no, they're all really interpenetrating. And to really see that—I mean, that's what really brings them to life. And so I wanted to work specifically with those three areas—liturgy and activity, really, when I talk about work practice, just activity, being active—and compassion, and how those interpenetrate and how that can help us.

So, an important part of ango is the chief disciple—in this case, it's Dayo. And Dayo is an ordained monastic, so it's always nice. It's nice to have every chief disciple—I think particularly for the residents, it's nice when it's a monastic one, just because it's somebody we live with and practice with every day, and there's that familiarity, and also because it means that person will be here every day practicing full-time with the residents. There's a lot of good spirit and energy in that. Dayo has been practicing for quite a number of years now, entered as a student of Hojin Sensei's, still a student studying with Hojin Sensei as well as myself, did Tokudo—full ordination—last year, and now is entering into this particular aspect of training.

So, the chief disciple, the way we present it, is now being pulled out and being put in a place of notice, right? And so in that way, it's one of the first times where the student really kind of is drawn out and steps out into sort of the sangha's eye. And their role is to practice, in a sense, to do exactly what they've been doing and to do that with a heightened sense, of course, of this time and of being in training. So ango, or chief discipleship, is training. So in the same way that being a monitor or the doan or the ino or the liturgist, it's a training, which means there's a beginning in which, in a way, you don't know what it is yet, right? A person can't know what it is yet. They've seen it, they've seen other people do it, they have a sense of it, but they haven't experienced it. And it's a whole different thing for the one who's sitting on that seat than the ones who are watching, right? To be in that place, to be going through that experience of training in this particular way, taking on some new responsibilities—because part of it is moving towards being a senior student, which means taking on different responsibilities. It means being in the sangha's eye in a different way, right? And so within that, there are certain reasonable expectations, right, that are good in terms of, you know, trying to get—every chief disciple wants to, as much as possible, harmonize their intention with their actions, to really practice with integrity and openness and honesty—not trying to be something that they're not, that's a trap. The chief disciple can fall into that, into thinking that somehow they should be something—no, they should be themselves. And that's their example, that depth of authenticity, that naturalness. And within that, they bring forth—that Dayo is bringing forth—an aspiration, an intention to plumb his own depths, to bring forth that authenticity just as fully, as completely, as vibrantly, as wisely, as compassionately as possible. And that's the best example we can give to each other. What more could we do?

This ango, of course, is taking place, as it always does, each time we do this, in a particular time. So in the fall, that ango was taking place within the context of the election that was getting ready to take place. And so I put a lot of thought beforehand into where will we be as people, as individuals, as practitioners, as a sangha, as a nation at that time? And what would be the good medicine in terms of training? And so here we are now in our time. There's an administration. Things are moving very fast. Those mental factors that I spoke of before, that bind us, that cause—arise from suffering within us and cause suffering outside of us—anger and resentment and spite and jealousy and arrogance and cruelty and faithlessness, or faith in the wrong things. Laziness, heedlessness, and laziness. Here we can be lazy while we're moving 100 miles an hour. We can be lazy about being self-aware. We can be lazy to compassion. We can be lazy about being concerned about the consequences of our actions on others. Worse than laziness, we can just be numb, or just not care, just not care or care about other things that are not the right things to care about, or call what we're doing caring for others and lying. And maybe we're lying to ourselves and don't know it. Maybe we're lying and we do know it.

But these mental factors, we see, we're in the midst of—they're in full bloom and at the highest levels. And so in that way, it's a time of distress. In a way, it's a time—not in a way, it is a time—of danger, both in the explicit things that we see taking place that are causing harm, but in a larger and deeper sense. Because when human beings give license to their delusion—and of course, we all do that, we all give license—but when we bring it into full bloom, when we sort of move along that spectrum, you know, if we think of the spectrum of the possibility of human nature and human activity, both in the spectrum towards enlightenment and selfless compassion, in the spectrum of creating hell realms, as we move along that spectrum further and further into delusion, we and the world become a more dangerous place.

And so it is a difficult time to be in, to be in the presence of that. It is not new. Remember, samsara has been around since the beginning. The Buddha helped to quell wars, and he had to stand back and watch wars that he could not stop.

So how do we practice? In a way, I don't know that that's really the right question. Because if you're a practitioner, you know the answer to that question. That's what the Eight Gates is—an articulation. If somebody has come here for the first time—if you are here for the first time this morning, you now have a sense of what we mean by practice. So in answer to how to practice, you have the practice of zazen. So in a way, asking ourselves, how should we be practicing now? I don't think is the right question. I think it's a misleading question because it suggests we don't know. And that's not true. We do know how to practice, wherever we are on our own path. What you know about practice is what practice is for you. It's not all. That's why it's a continuum—keep going, there's more. But we do know how to practice.

And so really, the question is—maybe it's not even a question, it's just a clear need, imperative to do that which we know, to be clear in our intentions. You know how to establish an intention. I hope you did it before you entered the zendo this morning. You know how to be mindful. You know how to be aware of thoughts that are arising, that are moving towards anger and resentment and bitterness and blame, or are moving towards numbness or denial or avoidance. You have a practice that has taught you how to bring that into your awareness and to respond. This is what we are training in—to be aware of when our speech is moving into the direction that so much speech is dwelling in right now: false speech, just lying, not telling the truth, divisive speech, harsh speech, and numbing speech. We know how to recognize when we are moving towards that. We know how to recognize it, how to recognize it when we're hearing it in others, and that we are being affected.

In a way, it's self-evident, but sometimes it helps just to acknowledge it: I am being affected by this. You are being affected. If you have gone numb, that's how you're being affected. Or that might be how a person is choosing to respond to how they're being affected. That may seem to help, but it's not helpful. And so to be aware that we are being affected, how we're being affected, and to take that energy that arises within difficult thoughts or difficult emotions and transform it—it's just energy—and to turn that into the dharma, that's when I gave a talk last week on taking refuge. That's what taking refuge is. And so you take refuge in Buddha, you take refuge in wisdom, you take refuge in the teachings, take refuge in the sangha. And we can do that everywhere.

When Dogen says, ""Do not say that someone holds the handle of creation,"" you could look at that as, in terms of, we are not victims. Don't be a victim. There are actors, for sure. There are things that are not in our control—absolutely. It's always been true. There are things that are happening that we cannot stop, not just because of a desire to or out of a willfulness. But don't put the handle of creation in someone else's hand, in terms of your mind, my mind, what I do with my emotions. When I feel anger arise, I see it, I know where it's coming from, I know what I've just encountered that is bringing forth that anger. But the anger belongs to me. It's mine. Nobody put it there. It's my responsibility. What do I want to do with that? Can I turn that into something that's helpful?

The causes and conditions for proceeding on the way give rise to good karmic roots when those causes and conditions are good. That's what this is about. That's the entirety of what this is about. It's the entirety of what Buddhadharma is about. It was what the Buddha gave his whole life to—to create the causes and conditions that are good. When he says causes and conditions for proceeding on the way, they have to be good, otherwise they're not causes and conditions for proceeding on the way. And that gives rise to good karmic roots, because it's coming from good. And that's what we can do. And that's what is needed.

Will it be enough? Right? I also don't know. I don't think that's the right question. As though this is a problem that is locatable in some place and can be fixed like a broken machine. Will it be good? Yes. Is good good? Yes. Do we need good in the world? Yes. Can you bring some? Yes.

I was reading a poem just recently by a 14th-century hermit, Chinese hermit, Chan monk named Stonehouse. He lived in a hermitage for like 20 years, and then he was called down to become abbot of a monastery. And after seven years of begging and begging and begging, they finally let him go back up to his hermitage. You want to go back to the mountain. I came across this poem, which got my attention:

A human life lasts a hundred years,
but which of us gets them all?
Precarious is a hut made of thatch
or a leaking boat in a storm.
Mediocre monks are pathetic,
would-be masters are sadder still.
The world's empty ways aren't new.
Some days I shut my door tight.

Even on a mountain. Even for a hermit. Just imagine if he had Wi-Fi or cell service, right? He'd never come out. But I just really appreciated that—even for someone who is living in the way, dedicated their life to it and has seen deeply the truth of Buddha nature and lives the joy of that—still, sometimes the world just gets to be too much. And don't you want to just shut your door? Just to acknowledge that impulse. But that's not our vow. He said ""some days,"" which means most of the days, not most of the days, that door is open. And that's really what we kind of signed up for. You may not have known that to begin with—I sure as hell didn't. Rather than make your skin thicker and thicker, you just lose it all.

So to be Avalokiteshvara, perceiving the cries of the world—that's a lot. And to do that and to know that that's really the only way, certainly the best way to live a life—to make your life larger, so big it has to be about others and you and me. In order to do that, though, we have to train, because otherwise you just get overwhelmed. Otherwise you just want to shut the door. And so to live in and be committed to a path of non-attachment so that we can come closer, so that we can come closer and claim your mind, right? It's easy to have your mind hijacked by everything that's going on, by others, by media. Don't let that happen. It's your mind. Guard it well, tend to it well.

That's what this ango, what I would like this ango to be about—for us and together. To answer the question, not ""how do we practice at such a time,"" but ""this is how we practice."" That's really what the chief disciple does. Just do it. Just do it. And in moments where it's not clear, you practice with that question, with that lack of clarity. Because in that moment of confusion or not knowing, having some clarity, that doesn't mean there's no clarity, doesn't mean you don't know anything, doesn't mean we've lost everything we've experienced or know about practice. That's the beauty of the path. It's never not.

There's no question that Zen has changed dramatically since its inception in China. Yet, one of the strengths of the Zen teachings has been its unique ability to metamorphose and adapt in accord with the imperative of time and place, circumstance, degree. On the other hand, at the core of this ancient tradition remains a critical, immutable truth that does not change—the heart of the Buddhist teachings, which has been conveyed for the past 2,500 years plus in Zen's journey across the face of the earth.

And then he said, ""It's my sincere wish that the readers of this book will discover for themselves that the spirit and authenticity of these teachings are still alive and intact in these pages."" And really, he means in these forms of training.

Let us show him that that is so. That would be a nice thing to give to Daido Roshi, because of whom we are here this morning.

This is from the Blue Cliff Record, Tungshan’s No Cold or Heat.

Pointer: 10,000 ages abide by the phrase that determines heaven and earth. Even the thousand sages cannot judge the ability to capture tigers and rhinos without any further traces of obstruction. The whole being appears everywhere equally. If you want to understand the hammer and tongs of transcendence, you need the forge and bellows of an adept. But say, since ancient times, has there ever been such a family style or not? To test, I’m citing this old case. Look.

A student asked Master Dongshan, “When cold and heat come, how can we avoid them?” Dongshan said, “Why don’t you go to the place where there is no cold or heat?” The student said, “What is the place where there is no cold or heat?” Tungshan said, “When it’s cold, the cold kills you. When it’s hot, the heat kills you.”

The verse: He lets down his hand, but still it’s the same as a 10,000 fathom cliff. Why must correct and biased be in an arrangement? The ancient Crystal Palace reflects the bright moon. The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs.

So maybe there were one or two things you came into this sesshin that you would be happy to avoid or ignore, or would be delighted if they would go away. That’s not a new thing. It’s been around a long time. The Buddha said over and over again that the path is about the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering. It’s about the cause of that which we’d like to avoid, and it’s about the cessation of that which we would like to avoid.

Abiding by the phrase that determines heaven and earth, Haukin says there’s no particular phrase that settles the universe. There’s only one phrase. The whole place, in its entirety, is the phrase that settles the universe. The whole place, the whole mind, the whole body.

The world just seems like it’s all cut up and divided, and we too just become part of the same formula—cut up and divided. The Buddha said it’s inevitable then that there will be conflict, and that conflict will be hard to avoid.

And so, if we want to understand the hammer and tongs of transcendence, we have to use the forge and bellows. That’s what we call practice. In the monastic tradition, there’s a sense or idea of formation. The monastic enters and begins a process of formation. I think that’s a wonderful and true description. We can also talk about the formation of a bodhisattva, the formation of an enlightened being. Having Buddha nature from the beginning, still there needs to be formation.

And so, we can talk about holding on and letting go, and stopping and seeing. Have faith that we’re like a priceless jewel that is covered with a little bit of dust and dirt obscures it. But this basic matter of wanting to avoid—when cold comes, how can I avoid it? It’s an honest question.

The footnote says, cold and heat are right in your face, all over, all throughout. Can’t really avoid it. Although, my goodness, we try. Think about how strong is the desire, the impulse, and the belief in avoiding what we dislike. From a place of distinct and separate, it makes sense. If you’re trying to cross the street and the street’s filled with traffic, you don’t just run out into it. There is something there.

I remember years ago when I was living in a temple, I took a long bike ride all the way up the West Side Greenway, up into the northern part of the island. No, I went up the east side because then I wanted to come back the west side. But I was way up, way up, way up. And I knew that the Greenway was down there, over there, but there were a bunch of woods. So I thought, well, I’ll just cut down through the woods and cross over and get on it so I don’t have to go back and go the long way. So I came down and there was about a four-foot wall and then there was the West Side Highway. It was extremely busy and I thought, I am not going back through those woods, I’m going across. So with my bicycle, I had to jump down, run across and not die. And I remember telling Dai An about this when I got back. She said, “Do not tell me these things.”

So avoiding sometimes is just plain common sense. When you touch a hot pan, your hand responds with wisdom, with intelligence. It knows what to do. It doesn’t need to think, it doesn’t discriminate, it doesn’t hate the pan, it just responds. It’s not avoiding anything. It’s immediate, spontaneous. So there’s the wisdom of not doing what is harmful. I mean, that’s what practice is about. That’s what the precepts are about. Sitting zazen is recognizing what is helpful and what is not. Understanding the nature of causation is understanding what actions lead to what consequences.

“All things everywhere equally” doesn’t mean that fire won’t burn your skin or extreme cold won’t cause frostbite, or that being burned is the same as getting frostbite. You and I are different, but we have the same nature. What is that? So how do we free ourselves?

This is really important to understand: that alleviating suffering doesn’t mean that an enlightened being becomes invulnerable to the elements, or that their body no longer has nerve endings that will send a message of pain to the brain. In the Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha talks about, very close to the end of his life, getting extremely sick and being in extreme pain. And that because it was not time yet for him to die, he bent it back, but there it was.

So think of just in an ordinary day like today, for example, how many moments has something arisen that you didn’t really like? It’s very simple, very ordinary, very common, very familiar. How many moments were there where you would have liked something else? Maybe in a small way, maybe in a big way. How often did that lead to judging and comparing? Or did it arise from judging or comparing? Did it end up blaming somebody or something for something? Was there frustration or resentment?

The Buddha taught that there is freedom through non-avoidance. How is this?

And so this student asks this question: “When cold and heat come, how can we avoid them?” Dongshan says, “Why don’t you go to a place where there is no cold or heat?” The footnote says the world’s people cannot find it. The world’s people cannot find it. Because we need a path, we need some wisdom. We need to know what we’re dealing with. But even Buddhas cannot find it. But that’s not the same. It’s not a place.

Faith Mind says, “Neither love nor hate, and you will clearly understand. When there is neither cold nor heat, then you know.”

Tenkei Denson said, “The twin roads of life and death are what students suffer over. This question here refers to them—life and death as cold or heat.” And you could just pick any duality, the duality of your choice du jour or of the moment, because it’ll change and then there’ll be a new one. Something that I don’t want means there’s something that I do want. Something that’s not good means something that there is good. Something that’s hurting means there’s something that’s not hurting—the twin roads.

The footnote also says, as soon as Dongshan lets down his hook, the student climbs onto it, like fishing. And actually, Tungshan wants that. Dongshan wants his student to climb on. He wants the student to respond. He welcomes the question. But really, he wants the student to climb on their own hook. He wants the student to, as they must, come to understand themselves.

I remember in the early years, for a while—probably longer than it needed be—there were so many times when things would arise in my mind, questions. And I would think about taking them to Dokusan and ask to understand it. And I would think, but I have to be the one to ultimately understand this, so what’s the point in asking? And then after a while, I realized—and in many brief Dokusans I realized—I’m not even giving him a chance to teach me. Yes, ultimately I have to know, I have to be the one. But how? Right? I’m not even giving him a chance. I’m not asking questions so he can throw out a hook that I can climb onto.

So Dongshan says, well, what is the place where there is no cold or heat? The student asks that: what is the place where there is no cold or heat? There’s got to be a place. Tell me and I will go there. Because I would very much like to avoid this.

The footnote says, the real does not conceal the false. The crooked does not hide the straight. So much seems hidden in practice. Things begin to be revealed. We begin to see things about ourselves, about our mind. We begin to have experiences—simple experiences, natural experiences within our meditation—that are affirming what the teachings are pointing to. We begin to realize nothing was actually hidden. I just didn’t see it. And the true does not conceal the false. Crooked doesn’t conceal the bent. It’s another way of saying, don’t waste anything. Don’t decide in advance something isn’t useful.

Haukin, speaking about this, said, when the monk asks the question, “What is this place?” Haukin says the student conceives an interpretation following the words and is trying to figure this out. The student doesn’t realize yet that they’ve been given a method of changing their bones. So often we just want to rearrange things a little bit on the surface. Just move the furniture a bit, make it more comfortable, make it work a little bit better. But the teacher wants us to change our bones, like a complete realignment from the inside.

An old master picked out this koan and said, “Dongshan puts the collar on the sleeve and cuts off the shirt front, under the armpits.” In other words, he’s just turning himself inside out for this student. But what could he do? The student didn’t like it.

And then another student, hearing this, came up and says, “Well, how then should they be dealt with?” And after a long silence, the master said, “Peaceful meditation does not require mountains and rivers. When you have extinguished the mind, fire itself is cool.”

Peaceful meditation does not require a certain time and place, a tranquil setting, a sesshin, silence, the right conditions for a long time. It can greatly benefit from those things. That’s why we create them. The Buddha said, go to a quiet and secluded place. Vimalakirti is revered as going into the busiest place possible to practice, recognizing that that would be a very advanced practice.

But this teacher is saying, we should know, though, that mountains, rivers—the perfect setting—is not required. Just extinguish the mind. Just let the mind come to an absolute rest. Then the fire itself is cool.

And so where is this place where there’s no cold or heat? Tungshan said, go to the place where the cold kills you. Go to the place where the heat kills you. Another translation says, where the cold destroys you. Stark. But what is being killed? It’s language to get our attention. To say let the mind rest is true, but it can sound a little bit too nice. We might miss it. But to say let the cold kill you makes you sit straight up. What it’s like if you meet the Buddha—kill the Buddha. What? What kind of killing is this? What is it that’s being killed? What is the distress?

If the Buddha’s enlightenment and the alleviation of his suffering was a result of him having transformed the world into a place where there was no longer greed, anger and delusion, pride and jealousy, no more conflict, no more division, no more hatred, then we wouldn’t need to be here, right? He would have done it. He would have said, no, you don’t need to change your bones, just change everything else. But that’s not it.

We change our bones because we can’t control the world. We can do stuff in the world. No one is without influence, and much needs changing. But to alleviate at a deep level ultimately means, just as peaceful meditation doesn’t require mountains and rivers, nor does liberating ourselves.

Another master asked a student, “When it’s so hot, where will you go to avoid it?” The student said, “I’ll avoid it inside a boiling cauldron, within the coals of a furnace.” The master said, “How can it be avoided in a boiling cauldron?” The student said, “The multitude of sufferings cannot reach here.”

There’s a koan in the miscellaneous early collection of koans that says, “How do you stop the suffering?” It’s directly this.

There’s another koan that says that there was a student who was studying with a master and came to take their leave. The teacher said, “I don’t have anything to give you, so I’ll give you this.” And he turned towards the charcoal burner and with tongs picked up a red hot piece of charcoal and gave it to the student. And the student did not know how to receive it. And so they stamped off and went back to their room and sat for some days. And then the koan says, then they came back to take their leave. The teacher handed them this red hot coal. And now the student knew how to receive it. And the question, of course, is, how did they receive it?

Think about just the very beginning of zazen. You begin sitting and pretty soon, very often, you experience a little bit of discomfort. Maybe your legs are tight, maybe they go to sleep, maybe there’s a little bit of pain. Maybe you have some difficult memories, maybe some emotion comes up. Maybe the person next to you is breathing too loud. How do you avoid that?

Well, you probably know how not to avoid it in the sense of dislike it, hate it, wish it wasn’t happening, want it to go away, getting angry, and then it gets—what?—stronger. It gets stronger. And so in the very beginning of beginning instruction, when there’s pain, you feel pain. Now can you dissolve that distance? Because there can be no—the multitude of sufferings cannot reach there—when you’re not there.

And so to enter fully into your breath, enter fully into the pain, which really means to extinguish your mind into the pain, into the breath, have no idea, no thought, no plan, not be trying to get away. That’s not a bargain you’re making. You’re just releasing, relinquishing, building no wall. Let the pain destroy you, dissolve the sense of you and pain, and it’s yours. And you don’t want to.

You know, those little—I mean, relatively speaking, they’re little—little pains, little discomforts. They can seem mightily big when they’re happening, but in the whole spectrum of possibility, you’re okay sitting here on this cushion experiencing some kind of discomfort. And that, that’s the training ground.

I remember the first time I entered into—because I was in a lot of pain. And the period was a long way off, the end of the period was a long way off. And I thought, gotta do something. And so I did what I had been taught. I turned my attention into that pain, and it wasn’t the same. And I remember thinking, I didn’t move, trying to figure it out, like, what was that? And it was important that I understood that I wasn’t just using, like, mind control, you know, to somehow suppress the pain or suppress my senses or something like that. Because I realized that isn’t actually what I was doing. It was more sort of the opposite, giving up control. And I realized, you know, as simple and slight as that was, that that was showing me something important, more important than I could even know at that time.

So he says in the verse, he lets down his hand, but still it’s the same as a 10,000 fathom cliff. Tungshan’s trying to help. He wants the student to resolve this. He knows how important it is. He knows how it will change a student’s life. But still, it’s as though the student is at the bottom of a 10,000 fathom cliff. Even with a helping hand, we still have to climb.

Why must correct and bias be in an arrangement? If you arrange them, the footnote says, where will you have today? How will you not become involved in dualism?

You know, one of the difficult things or tricky things about this essential teaching, you know, that by turning towards the very thing that we want to avoid—why we sit in stillness, why we practice with a discipline, right? Why we don’t just keep wiggling away, but actually hold ourselves, but hold ourselves well, right? Not just enduring, but actually the opposite. Relinquishing, surrendering, letting go, softening.

One of the tricky aspects about that is that sometimes in living, we’re in difficult situations or with difficult people or in a difficult time. We’re dealing with something very difficult within ourselves. And it can be hard to know. Like, the teaching seems to say, just keep turning in, keep turning in, keep going in with it, stay with it, don’t turn away.

Compassion is the embodiment of wisdom. And wisdom has an aspect of intelligence, right? It’s not one-dimensional, it’s street smart. There’s a common sense to it, you might say. And so how do you know when you’re in a difficult situation or difficult relationship and you have choices? Sometimes you don’t. You have to stay. But if you have choices, how do you know when to stay or when to leave? And in leaving, is that turning away, is that trying to escape, is that avoiding? Is that not good practice? How do we know when a situation is just not healthy, not helpful, not conducive? Sometimes maybe it’s fulfilled its purpose, or maybe there is a potential in that situation for it to be something different or for us to be at it in a different way. We sense that, but sometimes we may need to acknowledge there is the potential. But I don’t have that capacity right now.

And as a practitioner, that can be a tough discernment because it can feel like a failure. It can feel like not doing what the teachings are encouraging us to do. There may be a way to find peace in here, but I can’t find it right now. And I have tried. So how to know when to shift and when to keep turning towards? Is there a way of shifting, stepping back, turning away without turning away, without creating more dualism? There needs to be. We need to find that.

Practice is not a fixed rule. In a very real sense, in time, with lots of practice, experience—actually experience and practicing and engaging—we’re learning, we’re developing, we’re having all kinds of experiences in different situations, and we’re seeing how different situations, different ways of engaging, lead to different consequences, different results. That’s developing knowledge, you could say, so that we’re getting wiser, smarter, hopefully.

Sometimes we can shift from within and enter more fully, and sometimes we need to shift in a new direction and enter more fully. And of course, the thing is, we have to make that decision. It’s good to seek counsel, it’s good to get advice, good to get some help. But ultimately, each of us in those moments is the one who makes the decision. And it must be like that, because in that action, in that choice, we are creating karma, right? And it’s important that we take ownership of that. You know, if you’re in a tough spot and you ask somebody what to do and they tell you and you do it and it doesn’t work out, who’s going to get the blame? You told me to do this. If you do it and it does work out, what have you learned?

Why must correct and bias be in an arrangement? The world is filled with differences—of everything. That’s not changing. We’re not trying to change that through practice. We’re trying to understand it at its deepest level and free ourselves of the discriminating mind which sees the differences and then divides and separates and ranks and elevates and subjugates, so then we can move within those differences without being fooled—fooling ourselves.

I did an interview just this week with somebody who has a podcast, can’t remember the name—Shrinking Trump, that’s the name. And a psychologist. And he was here like 25, 30 years ago, I think. Came for an introductory retreat and told a story about being here in the zendo and sitting zazen for the first time. Mind was a mess. Went into Dokusan to Daido Roshi, talked about his messy mind. And Daido Roshi lied and said, “Just keep letting go. Keep, keep letting go.”

So he said, the next day—I’m not sure what he was here for, maybe it was an introductory J—but the next day, he had an opportunity to have another dokusan. And he’d had some more sitting, and he’d had a moment where everything fell away and he was just in bliss. It’s perfect. So he was very eager to share this with Daido Roshi. So he goes running in and shares his wonderful moment. And Daido Roshi listened to him and said, “Okay, just let that go.” I said, yeah, that’s pretty much it.

It’s not because one is good and one’s bad. It’s just keep doing that, whatever it is—going to the place that we would like to avoid. Let the heat kill you, the cold kill you, kill the idea, the belief, the view, the attachment. Because there’s actually nothing there. There’s nothing you can touch, nothing you can put in a box, nothing you could bury, nothing you could even extinguish. And yet the sense of that something which has no substance is so strong.

That’s why the analogy of a magician—the magician creates an illusion, and everybody sees it, and it’s real. It is there. Something’s there. Everybody’s seeing it. But it’s not as it appears. We cannot know that when we’re standing over here looking at the illusion. As long as we’re in the audience, we cannot know that. That’s why we sit on this cushion.

In the early days, sometimes when people would come and say, they would say, “I’m not really interested in practicing, but can I just sit in the back while you guys are meditating and watch zazen or sitting?” No tourists. We have no audience. No one’s performing. It’s all in. And that takes some faith, particularly when it’s difficult.

And you can imagine that with different kinds of challenges, different kinds of hot and cold, and when heat and cold is simple pain, in a way, it hurts, but it’s simple. It’s immediate, it’s physical. It’s right there. It’s not that complicated. That’s why it’s so important to practice those moments. Because the principle or the Dharma of what’s being experienced in that moment where it kills you is the same as when it’s something that seems much more complicated, because the thing that we want to avoid ultimately is not what’s going on out there, but it’s the mind.

The ancient crystal palace reflects the bright moon. The footnote says round and full. Just don’t grasp the reflection, so try and take it home. Don’t try and hold on to it. The sly hound of Han vainly runs up the stairs. Story about a dog who saw the moon through the window at the top of the stairs and ran up trying to get it.

These teachings, this practice in a way, is more profound, more thoroughgoing than we can imagine, and also more simple, more immediate, more accessible than we might think. It’s because it’s so close that it can be hard to see.

Lama Surya Das (Jeffery Miller 1950 - ) is a Western Buddhist meditation teacher and scholar, one of the main interpreters of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, and a leading spokesperson for the emerging American Buddhism. The Dalai Lama affectionately calls him â€œThe Western Lama.â€
Surya has spent over forty five years studying Zen, Vipassana, Yoga, and Tibetan Buddhism with the great masters of Asia, including the Dalai Lamaâ€™s own teachers, and has twice completed the traditional three year meditation cloistered retreat at his teacherâ€™s Tibetan monastery. He is an authorized lama and lineage holder in the Nyingmapa School of Tibetan Buddhism, and a close personal disciple of the leading grand lamas of that tradition. He is the founder of the Dzogchen Center and Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and its branch centers around the country. 
He has brought many Tibetan lamas to this country to teach and start centers and retreats. As founder of the Western Buddhist Teachers Network with the Dalai Lama, he regularly helps organize its international Buddhist Teachers Conferences. He is also active in interfaith dialogue and charitable projects in the Third World. In recent years, Lama Surya has turned his efforts and focus towards youth and contemplative education initiatives, what he calls â€œTrue higher education and wisdom for life training.â€
Lama Surya Das is a sought after speaker and lecturer, a published author, translator, and contributor to major newspapers.

From Master Daowi:
â€œPeople are backwards. Ignorant of the True Self, they pursue things, willing to suffer immeasurable pains in greed for a little bit of pleasure. In the mornings, before they open their eyes and have gotten out of bed when theyâ€™re still only half awake, their minds are already flying about in confusion flowing along with random thoughts. Although good and bad deeds have not yet appeared, heaven and hell are already formed in their hearts before they even get out of bed. By the time they go into action, the seeds of heaven and hell are already implanted planted in their mindsâ€.","","Ron Hogen Green","","","Religion and Spirituality","0:40:11 (approx)","1996 Fall"

Peter M. Matthiessen (Isshin Muryo Roshi, 1927 â€“ 2014) was an author, naturalist, activist, and Zen teacher. Muryo Roshi began his Zen practice in 1970, with Soen Nakagawa Roshi. In 1976, he met Bernard Tetsugen Glassman (aka "" Bernie Roshi"") and began studying with him shortly after that. He was Bernie's first Dharma successor and became a Roshi himself in 1997. Bernie's practice and teachings as the founder of the Zen Peacemaker Order (https://zenpeacemakers.org) had a profound effect on Muryo Roshi's life as a Zen Master. He was deeply drawn to the practice of bearing witness, going to Auschwitz three times, and doing street retreats.

He deeply embraced the guidance of the Three Tenets of the Zen Peacemakers:
â€¢ Not-knowing- giving up fixed ideas about ourselves and the universe
â€¢ Bearing witness to the joy and suffering of the world
â€¢ Taking Actions that arise from Not-Knowing and Bearing Witness

He is author of over 30 books and won the National Book Award three times, the third for his novel Shadow Country (2008), making him the only writer to receive the award for both fiction and nonfiction.

Jon Kabat-Zinn (born Jon Kabat, June 5, 1944) is an American professor emeritus of medicine and the creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn was a student of Zen Buddhist teachers such as Philip Kapleau, Thich Nhat Hanh and Seung Sahn and a founding member of Cambridge Zen Center. His practice of yoga and studies with Buddhist teachers led him to integrate their teachings with scientific findings. He teaches mindfulness, which he says can help people cope with stress, anxiety, pain, and illness. The stress reduction program created by Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), is offered by medical centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations.

Dogen said,
â€œWhen the Seal of Enlightenment (Shisho â€“ the document of transmission) is received, there is self-enlightenment with no master. And self-enlightenment with no self. That is why we say Buddhas transmit enlightenment and ancestors mutually pledge enlightenment. If you are not a Buddha, you cannot clarify the essence of this principle. Even those people who are on the highest level or have the status of a Buddha cannot easily grasp this. So how is it possible for scholars of the Sutra or Abhidharma to conjecture about it? They may pretend to explain it, but they have no real understanding.

Buddhas transmit to Buddhas, and only Buddhas can master the Buddha way. There is no place Buddhas are not. For example, stones transmit stones. Jade transmits jade. Chrysanthemums and pine trees transmit and hand down the Seal of Enlightenment. Each generation of chrysanthemums or pine trees passes its life to the next generationâ€.

This is a talk given at the Buddhism in America Retreat, held on January 17, 18, and 19, 1997 in Boston, Massachusetts.

Lama Tsultrim Allione is an author and teacher who has studied in Tibetan Buddhismâ€™s Karma Kagyu lineage. She was born in 1947 in Maine under the name Joan RousmaniÃ¨re Ewing. She first travelled to India and Nepal in 1967, returned in 1969 and January 1970 she became one of the first American women to be ordained as a Tibetan nun. She was given her vows by the Karmapa, from the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, who gave her the name Karma Tsultrim Chodron. Allione gave back her monastic vows four years later and married. She has given birth to four children, one of whom died from sudden infant death syndrome. Tsultrim Allione continued her studies and Buddhist practice, which led to the 1984 publication of her book Women of Wisdom, a collection of the namtar of six Tibetan Buddhist yogini such as Machig LabdrÃ¶n (founder of the ChÃ¶d practice), Ayu Khandro Dorje Paldron (1839â€“1953), Nangsa Obum, Jomo Menmo (1248â€“1283), Machig Ongjo and Drenchen Rema. This is the work for which she is most well known, and it has since been translated from English into several foreign languages and expanded in a revised 2nd edition. In 1993, with her husband, David Petit, Tsultrim Allione founded Tara Mandala, a retreat center in southern Colorado, in the United States. As well as offering retreats at Tara Mandala, Allione regularly teaches in the United States and Europe.

In 2008 Lama Tsultrim Allioneâ€™s book Feeding Your Demons was published, an approach based on the ChÃ¶d lineage of Machig LabdrÃ¶n that Allione has practiced since 1973. Allione opens chapter five of the book by quoting Carl Jung as saying, â€œOne does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light but by making the darkness conscious.â€ Mark Epstein has described her work as â€œa book that Carl Jung could only have dreamed of writing.â€ Allione claims that the â€œprocess of feeding our demons is a method for bringing our shadow into consciousness and accessing the treasures it holds rather than repressing it.â€

In 2009, Lama Tsultrim Allione was selected by an esteemed committee of scholars and practitioners to receive the international â€œOutstanding Woman in Buddhismâ€ Award given in Bangkok, Thailand. 
Lama Tsultrim is enjoying being the grandmother of six and has completed her new book, Wisdom Rising: Journey into the Mandala of the Empowered Feminine, published by Simon and Schuster in May 2018. At the same time, Lama Tsultrim continues to guide Tara Mandala and thousands of students around the world. Her writings and teachings come from her sublime Tibetan lamas as well as her experience as a Western woman and mother. She is known for her ability to translate the wisdom of the ancient Tibetan Buddhist tradition into clear teachings that are relatable and relevant to Western audiences.","","Other","","","Religion and Spirituality","1:01:39 (approx)","1996 Winter"

James Ishmael Ford (Zeno Myoun, Roshi) is an American Zen Buddhist priest and a retired Unitarian Universalist minister. He was born in Oakland, California on July 17, 1948. He earned a BA in psychology from Sonoma State University, as well as an MDiv and an MA in the Philosophy of Religion, both from the Pacific School of Religion.
Ford began his Zen studies in 1968 at the Berkeley Zen Center under the direction of Mel Weitsman, later Weitsman, Roshi. He was ordained unsui and received Dharma transmission from the late Jiyu Kennett Roshi. After leaving Kennett Roshi's Shasta Abbey and for a brief time exploring other religious traditions including the Episcopal Church, the western Gnostic tradition and Inayat Khan Sufism, Ford pursued Zen koan introspection for nearly twenty years in the Sanbo Kyodan tradition with John Tarrant Roshi, with whom he completed formal training and from whom he received Inka Shomei (formal recognition as an authorized Zen teacher) in 2005.

Ford began to be seriously involved in Unitarian Universalism at about the same time he began his work with Tarrant Roshi. After completing theological studies he became a Unitarian Universalist minister, serving Unitarian Universalist congregations in Wisconsin and Arizona before becoming senior minister of the First Unitarian Society in Newton, MA in 2000. In May 2008 First Unitarian Church of Providence, RI called him to its pulpit; he began his ministry there in the summer of that year.
Roshi Ford also maintained his relationships within the Soto community, and in 2004 Ford participated in the first Dharma Heritage ceremony of the forming North American Soto Zen Buddhist Association. This event, designed to be the equivalent of the Japanese Soto Zuisse ceremony, was a public acknowledgment of Ford (among others) as a senior member of the North American Zen community. Ford, a past president of the Unitarian Universalist Buddhist Fellowship, was the first Unitarian Universalist minister to be named a Zen master.

Roshi Ford is a significant figure in the establishment of Zen in North America. He is the co-founder and first abbot of Boundless Way Zen, a network of meditation groups mostly in eastern Massachusetts. He was also influential in the development of the Nebraska Zen Center in Omaha and the Great Heartland Buddhist Temple in Toledo, Ohio.

In 2015, Ford retired from his ministry at the First Unitarian Church of Providence, left Boundless Way, and moved to Long Beach, California. He then established the Empty Moon Zen Network, a network of Zen Centers in California, Washington state, and Pennsylvania.

Starting in April 2019, he has served as a minister at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Anaheim.
Ford is co-editor of The Transient and Permanent in Liberal Religion, and is the author of This Very Moment: A Brief Introduction to Buddhism and Zen for Unitarian Universalists, both published by Skinner House Books. He is also the author of a study of Zen teachers and communities in North America, Zen Master Who? A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen, the co-editor of The Book of Mu: Essential Writings on Zenâ€™s Most Important Koan, and the author of If You're Lucky, Your Heart Will Break: Field Notes from a Zen Life from Wisdom Publications. His most recent book is Introduction to Zen Koans: Learning the Language of Dragons also released by Wisdom.

Ford is a member of the American Zen Teachers Associated and served on its membership committee for a decade. he is also a member of the Soto Zen Buddhist Association, in which he served on the board of directors. He maintains connections with the Unitarian Universalist community through his work with their Society for Community Ministries and Spiritual Directorâ€™s Network.

Roshi Ford has nine Dharma heirs including Josh Jiun Bartok Roshi of the Greater Boston Zen Center, Melissa Myozen Blacker Roshi of Boundless Way Temple, Dosho Port Roshi of the Nebraska Zen Center, and Jay Rinsen Weik Sensei of the Buddhist Temple of Toledo, Ohio.

Ed Sanders was born in Kansas City, Missouri. He dropped out of the University of Missouri in 1958 and hitchhiked to New York City's Greenwich Village to attend New York University. He graduated in 1964, with a degree in Greek.

Sanders wrote his first notable poem, ""Poem from Jail"", on toilet paper in his cell after being jailed for protesting the launch of nuclear submarines armed with nuclear missiles in 1961. In 1962, he founded the avant-garde journal Fuck You/A Magazine of the Arts. Sanders opened the Peace Eye Bookstore at 383 East Tenth Street in what was then the Lower East Side; the store became a gathering place for Bohemians, writers and radicals. On January 1, 1966, police raided Peace Eye Bookstore and charged Sanders with obscenity, charges he fended off with the aid of the ACLU. Notoriety generated by the case led to his appearance on the February 17, 1967 cover of Life Magazine, which proclaimed him ""a leader of New York's Other Culture.""

In late 1964, Sanders founded the Fugs with Tuli Kupferberg. The band broke up in 1969 and reformed in 1984. On October 21, 1967, on the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's March on the Pentagon, Sanders helped The Fugs and the San Francisco Diggers in an attempt to ""exorcise"" The Pentagon. In 1968, he signed the ""Writers and Editors War Tax Protest"" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In 1969, Sanders recorded and released his first solo album for Reprise Records, Sanders' Truck Stop. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: ""This is literally a country-rock takeoffâ€”not a parody but a departure. But though I hesitate to criticize a man who is not only a saint and a genius but who says hello to me at the post office, I must point out that the yodeling country twang Sanders developed with the Fugs has never known the difference between parody and departure, which makes some of these songs seem crueller than they're intended to be. Of course, sometimes they're cruel on purposeâ€”like 'The Iliad,' a saga of good old queer-bashing with a Greek-to-me intro. And sometimes, like 'Jimmy Joe, the Hippybilly Boy,' they'reâ€”snurfleâ€”lyrical and sad.â€

In 1971, Sanders wrote The Family, a profile of the events leading up to the Tate-LaBianca murders. He attended the Manson group's murder trial, and spent time at their residence at the Spahn Movie Ranch. There have been two updated editions of The Family, the most recent in 2002. The Process Church of the Final Judgement sued Sanders's U.S. publisher for defamation over a chapter linking them with Manson's activities. The case was settled by the publisher, who removed the disputed chapter from future editions. The Process Church then sued Sanders's British publisher, but lost the suit and were forced to pay the defendant's legal fees.

Sanders is the founder of the Investigative Poetry movement. His 1976 manifesto Investigative Poetry, published by Lawrence Ferlinghettiâ€™s City Lights Books, influenced investigative writing and poetry during the ensuing decades. In the 1990s, Sanders began utilizing the principles of Investigative Poetry to create a series of book-length poems on literary figures and American History. Among these works are Chekhov, 1968: A History in Verse, and The Poetry and Life of Allen Ginsberg. In 1998, Sanders began work on a 9-volume America, A History in Verse. The first five volumes, tracing the history of the 20th century, were published in a CD format with over 2,000 pages in length.

Sanders received a Guggenheim Fellowship in poetry in 1983, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in poetry in 1987. His Thirsting for Peace in a Raging Century, Selected Poems 1961â€“1985 won an American Book Award in 1988. He was chosen to deliver the Charles Olson Memorial Lectures at SUNY Buffalo in 1983. In 1997, he received a Writers Community residency sponsored by the YMCA National Writer's Voice through the Lila Wallace Readers Digest Fund.

In 1997 he was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2000 and 2003 he was Writer-in-Residence at the New York State Writers Institute in Albany, New York.

Sanders lives in Woodstock, New York, where he publishes the online Woodstock Journal with his wife of over 47 years, writer and painter Miriam R. Sanders. He also invents musical instruments, including the Talking Tie, the microtonal Microlyre, and the Lisa Lyre, a musical contraption involving light-activated switches and a reproduction of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

Ronnie Nyogetsu Reishin Seldin (1947 â€“ 2017) 
Founder of the Ki-Sui-An Shakuhachi Dojo in New York City with several branches on the East Coast, Ronnie studied shakuhachi in Kyoto, Japan with Kurahashi Yodo Sensei, who was a disciple of Jin Nyodo. There, in 1975, he received the name Nyogetsu and a teaching certificate at the level of Jun Shi-han in the Kinko school of shakuhachi. After his return to New York, Nyogetsu was awarded the rank of Shi-han (Master) in 1978, as a result of his efforts to spread the teaching of this instrument in America. In 1980, he received his Dai Shi-han, or Grand Master's license. In 2001 he received Koku-An Dai-Shihan (Grand Master's license at the level of Kyu-Dan, or 9th level) from Japan's Living National Treasure in shakuhachi, Aoki Reibo. Ronnie was also given the name Reishin (Heart/Mind of the Bell) at that time.

Clark Strand

A former Zen Buddhist monk, he was the first Senior Editor of Tricycle: The Buddhist Review.

Zenkei Blanche Hartman (1926â€“May 13, 2016) was a Soto Zen teacher practicing in the lineage of Shunryu Suzuki. From 1996 to 2002 she served two terms as co-abbess of the San Francisco Zen Center. She was the first woman to assume such a leadership position at the center. A member of the American Zen Teachers Association, Blanche was especially known for her expertise in the ancient ritual of sewing a kesa. Hartman became known for her attention to issues women face; she and her late husband Lou Hartman had four children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren.

Blanche Hartman was born in Birmingham, Alabama to non-practicing Jewish parents in 1926. Educated in the Catholic school system in the early 1930sâ€”and impressed with the religiosity and faith of one teacherâ€”in 1943 she moved to California, where her father served in the military.

After taking up biochemistry and chemistry at the University of California she married Lou Hartman in 1947, giving birth to four children. In the late 1950s she found work as a chemist, though by 1968 she began questioning the direction of her life. She and her husband began sitting zazen regularly at the Berkeley Zen Center in Berkeley, California in 1969, and in 1972 the two entered Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. The couple lived at all of the other San Francisco Zen Center sites, including City Center and Green Gulch Farm. (Lou died in 2011 and Blanche later lived at AgeSong.)

During the 1970s, Blanche received training in Nyoho-e â€“ a traditional method for sewing Buddha's robeâ€”in the lineage of Sawaki Kodo Roshi from Kasai Joshin Sensei, formerly of Antaiji. Blanche was fundamental to the spread of devotional sewing practice throughout North America. She and Lou were both ordained as priests by Zentatsu Richard Baker in 1977, and Blanche was given the Buddhist name Zenkei (meaning inconceivable joy).

In 1988 she received shiho from Sojun Mel Weitsman, and in 1996 she became installed as co-abbess of the San Francisco Zen Center. This was the first female abbess of the City Center, having served just after Tenshin Reb Anderson and Sojun Mel Weitsman. One reason Blanche accepted the position of co-abbess, serving two terms from 1996 to 2002, is that she understood the need for women to have a role model.","","Other","","","","0:18:33 (approx)","1995 Summer"

John R. McRae (1947â€“2011) was a renowned expert on Chinese Chan who also possessed an extensive knowledge of the field of Buddhism in general. After getting a PhD at Yale University, he taught at Cornell and Indiana Universities before moving to Japan and teaching part-time at Komazawa University. As a specialist in East Asian Buddhism, he was especially interested in ideologies of spiritual cultivation and how they interact with their intellectual and cultural environments. His seminal work on Chinese Chan was The Northern School and the Formation of Early Chan Buddhism (University of Hawai`i Press, 1986). This was later followed by Seeing through Zen: Encounter, Transformation, and Genealogy in Chinese Chan Buddhism (University of California Press, 2003). He spent much of his career studying the life of the important Chan figure Shenhui (684â€“758), and was expecting to complete a manuscript on the topic before his passing in October of 2011 from pancreatic cancer. John also completed a number of translations of Chinese Buddhist scriptural texts for the BukkyÅ DendÅ KyÅkai's English translation series, and served as Chair of the Publication Committee for the series until his passing.","","Other","","","","2:08:23 (approx)","1994 Fall"

Jeffrey Hopkins (born 1940) is an American Tibetologist. He is Emeritus of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia, where he taught for more than three decades since 1973. He has authored more than twenty-five books about Tibetan Buddhism, among them the highly influential Meditation on Emptiness, which appeared in 1983, offering a pioneering exposition of Prasangika-Madyamika thought in the Geluk tradition. From 1979 to 1989 he was the Dalai Lama's chief interpreter into English and he played a significant role in the development of the Free Tibet Movement. In 2006 he published his English translation of a major work by the Jonangpa lama, Dolpopa, on the Buddha Nature and Emptiness called Mountain Doctrine.

Zen Master Soeng Hyang, Barbara Rhodes, or Bobby, as she is known to many people, was one of Zen Master Seung Sahnâ€™s first American students and began studying with him in 1972. She was given inka, or permission to teach, in 1977 and received dharma transmission from Zen Master Seung Sahn in 1992. For many years Bobby worked as a hospice nurse and her practice and teaching was profoundly impacted by sitting with her patients as they transitioned from this body. Today, Zen Master Soeng Hyang is the guiding Zen Master of the Kwan Um School of Zen, a Korean lineage, which includes over a hundred centers and temples worldwide.","","Other","","","","1:35:10 (approx)","1994 Spring"

Clark Strand was raised as a Southern Presbyterian and studied philosophy and religion at Sewanee: The University of the South.

Strand's early explorations into Zen Buddhism enabled him to become a leader in this sect while residing at a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monastery. But he left this monastic order, and engaged in self-discovery through psychoanalysis, while working as the editor of Tricycle. In this position, he fortuitously learned about many schools of Buddhism in Asia and the West. He also explored the activities of various religious communities, including Buddhist temples, Hasidic synagogues, Christian monasteries and Hindu cults, in order to understand religionâ€™s compatibility with the realities of modern life.

In January, 2000, Strand founded the Koans of the Bible Study Group (since renamed Woodstock Buddhist Bible Study), a weekly inter-religious discussion group devoted to finding a new paradigm for religious belief and practice.

In the early 2,000s, he began exploring the Soka Gakkai International originated from Soka Gakkai Japan, a humanistic religion based on the teachings of the 13th century Japanese monk, Nichiren who lived in Kamakura period. Strand's studies of this religion led him to write Waking the Buddha. Selection from this book: ""One of the most striking things about the Soka Gakkai from a Buddhist point of view is its emphasis on attaining victory in ordinary life--sometimes under extraordinary circumstances...members chant the mantra-like title of the Lotus Sutra, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, as a way of harnessing the universal life force inherent in their own bodies and minds...That principle of interconnectedness corresponds with what we know today about particle physics and planetary ecology, both of which support the view that all things are intimately interrelated and dependent upon one another-- that nothing exists as separate and alone.""

Strand has written five other books, as well as articles on a variety of religious, spiritual and ecological themes. He writes for The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The New York Times, Newsweekâ€™s On Faith Blog, Tricycle, Body & Soul, Spirituality & Health and several other publications.","","Other","","","","2:22:39 (approx)","1993 Winter"

This is a brief excerpt from the retreat. In it the participants sing in the â€œThe Tuning Meditationâ€, which she introduces before the piece begins.

Pauline Oliveros (May 30, 1932 â€“ November 24, 2016) was an American composer, accordionist and a central figure in the development of experimental and post-war electronic art music.

She was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the 1960s, and served as its director. She taught music at Mills College, the University of California San Diego (UCSD), Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros authored books, formulated new music theories, and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of ""deep listening"" and ""sonic awareness"".

In 1988, as a result of descending 14 feet into an underground cistern to make a recording, Oliveros coined the term ""deep listening"", a pun that has blossomed into ""an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation. This aesthetic is designed to inspire both trained and untrained performers to practice the art of listening and responding to environmental conditions in solo and ensemble situations"".","","Other","","","","0:17:21 (approx)","1993 Winter"

Lex Hixon (1941â€“1995) (born Alexander Paul Hixon Junior, also known as Nur al-Anwar al-Jerrahi in the Sufi community) was an American Sufi author, poet, and spiritual teacher. He practiced and held membership in several of the world's major great religious traditions, and documented his spiritual explorations in nine books and many articles and teachings given to various groups. His passionate conviction that all of the great religions are true was sparked by his study of the life and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, and he made his life a witness to this belief by fully immersing himself in multiple religious practices and studies, not as a research project but as an act of faith.

His book, Mother of the Buddhas: Meditations on the Prajnaparamita Sutra is discussed in this talk.","","Other","","","","1:15:52 (approx)","1993 Summer"

â€œ . . . If we experience the inner essence of the training period, we can push on. And, all our actions: taking meals, stretching out our feet and sleeping will be forms of training throughout our lives.
If we grasp this, we will be diligent and not relaxed for even a moment. Such action is the ninety day training period. This is the key point, an original face of the Buddhas and Ancestors. It is here that we touch their skin, flesh, bones and marrow. The days and months of a ninety-day spring training period carry the enlightened vision and essence of the Buddhas and Ancestors. Even in just one term of spring training, people become Buddhas and Ancestors. Both the beginning and end of the training period are the Buddhas and Ancestors. Outside of this, there is nothing, neither large nor small. . .â€","","John Daido Loori","","","","1:34:50 (approx)","1993 Spring"

John R. McRae (1947â€“2011) was a renowned expert on Chinese Chan who also possessed an extensive knowledge of the field of Buddhism in general. After getting a PhD at Yale University, he taught at Cornell and Indiana Universities before moving to Japan and teaching part-time at Komazawa University. As a specialist in East Asian Buddhism, he was especially interested in ideologies of spiritual cultivation and how they interact with their intellectual and cultural environments. His seminal work on Chinese Chan was The Northern School and the Formation of Early Chan Buddhism (University of Hawai`i Press, 1986). This was later followed by Seeing through Zen: Encounter, Transformation, and Genealogy in Chinese Chan Buddhism (University of California Press, 2003). He spent much of his career studying the life of the important Chan figure Shenhui (684â€“758), and was expecting to complete a manuscript on the topic before his passing in October of 2011 from pancreatic cancer. John also completed a number of translations of Chinese Buddhist scriptural texts for the BukkyÅ DendÅ KyÅkai's English translation series, and served as Chair of the Publication Committee for the series until his passing.","","Other","","","","1:35:32 (approx)","1992 Winter"

When you are born, where do you come from?
When you die, where do you go?
Life is like a floating cloud that appears.
Death is like a floating cloud that disappears
Life and death, coming and going,
Are also like that.
There is one thing that always remains clear.
Itâ€™s pure. Itâ€™s clear. 
It is not dependent on anything else.
And what is the one pure and clear thing?","","Other","","","","0:59:46 (approx)",""

Wilmer was born in 1917 and earned his BA, MB and PhD. at the University of Minnesota, and later trained in psychiatry at the Mayo clinic. Wilmer began his career as a Freudian analyst but adopted a Jungian approach after receiving Jungian analyst training in Zurich.

In 1955 Wilmer was drafted into the U.S. Navy and served at the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California where he oversaw the care of Naval and Marine Corps patients with a variety of mental disorders. While serving at Oak Knoll, Wilmer developed his approach to group therapy, and integrated video technology into his practice. His observations about group interaction eventually led to his book Social Psychiatry in Action, later developed into the 1961 docudrama People Need People, hosted by Fred Astaire.

Dr. Wilmer continued his group therapy work in the late 1960's through the University of California at San Francisco, eventually establishing the Youth Drug Ward at the Langely Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute. The Youth drug ward served young hippies from the Haight-Ashbury district who had experienced adverse affects from drug use. The therapy included ""creativity seminars"" which featured such artists as Joan Baez and Rod Steiger. Also during the 1960s, Wilmer worked extensively with inmates from the San Quentin prison and their families.

In 1969 Dr. Wilmer moved to Texas and became professor of Psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio. While there he provided therapy at a Veterans Hospital for Vietnam War veterans who were suffering from PTSD. He later expanded his practice to those affected by AIDS.

Dr. Wilmer retired from psychiatry in 1980 and the same year established the Institute for the Humanities at Salado, where he hosted artists, scholars and other speakers to conduct workshops and give lectures. Dr. Wilmer was a prolific writer with such titles to his name as Practical Jung: Nuts and Bolts of Jungian Psychotherapy, Closeness in Personal and Professional Relationships, How Dreams Help and many more.","","Other","","","","1:14:41 (approx)","1992 Summer"

What are the attributes of a person with great spiritual realization?  This eye-opening dharma discourse by Geoffrey Shugen Arnold,  Sensei explores a koan in which the Zen master Bodhidharma asks his students to express their realization and then transmits his role as teacher to one of the students.  Shugen Sensei warns us not to make the typical assumption that the recipient's realization was higher than his peers.  He demonstrates that this tendency to compare leads to many of the world's problems and inequalities, and specifically discusses the greed involved in the privatization of American prisons.  Indeed, spiritual realization entails ceasing to compare others, and instead, seeing the perfection in everyone.","Geoffrey Shugen Arnold","True Dharma Eye","201","Religion & Spirituality","0:51:13 (approx)","2012 Winter"

Does enlightenment come suddenly or gradually?  Is it helpful or necessary to use concepts to guide our spiritual practice?  Or do we need to let go of preconceptions to be open to reality as it is unfolding now?  In this dharma discourse, Konrad Ryushin Marchaj, Sensei addresses this quandary from citing approaches as gradual as understanding the twelve links in the chain of interdependent coordination and as sudden as the teacher striking the student in numerous Zen discourses.  We are urged to find our practice and ourselves within the dynamic tension of this question.","Konrad Ryushin Marchaj","","73","Religion & Spirituality","0:46:19 (approx)","2012 Winter"

We take the genuine spiritual path of renunciation when we realize that our habits, fixations, and craving cause suffering for ourselves and others.  In order to see the roots our our neurosis and become free, we must cultivate deep silence and stillness. This can cause the insanity and suffering within the world to be much more apparent to us. However, Geoffrey Shugen Arnold, Sensei warns us that we cannot allow the calm of spiritual practice to become a hiding place.  Instead, we must see the clarity that is always present, even in the midst of chaos of the world.  By trusting this inherent clarity, we can work within the world with wisdom and compassion.

n zen practice, we are often admonished to cease looking outside of ourselves.  What does this really mean?  In the beginning, it can be interpreted as letting go of the illusion that if only we had the right conditions we would be content.  However, we often enter spiritual life with the same attitude: that if only our practice was more ideal, then we would realize ourselves.  According to Konrad Ryushin Marchaj, Sensei, the novice practitioner looks in order to see.  To deepen our practice, we must recognize the seeing that comes before looking, as if we are becoming aware of the source of a light rather than the object that is illuminated.  Only then will our inherent clarity and freedom become available to us.

What does it mean to look deeply within? To plumb the depths of our being, we need to recognize the ""seeing that comes before looking,"" becoming aware of the source of the light, rather than the object it illuminates.

The Advantage of New Years ( part 2 )
A monk asked Jinqing Daofu,""Is there Buddha Dharma at the beginning of the year or not?
Jingqing said, ""There is.""
The monk asked, ""What is the Buddha Dharma at the beginning of the new year?""
Jingqing said, :"" New year is auspicious. The myriad things are new.
etc...

Shugen focused on the first and the last parts of the koan. Master Jingqing's answer and Master Dogen's comments on the answers.

He talked:
- about the newness of things... how in a sense being creatures of habit
even if we want to experience the freshness of the moment and get rid of the burden of the past, we can be afraid of the unknown and step back.
What is new has not existed before, never occurred before, but the Buddha said: ""everything is completely the same and completely different simultaneously, without conflict.""

- about the vows of the teachers to alleviate the students's sufferings; the student has to die to his personal self, to what he calls himself.

- about the inner journey being the greatest and the most difficult journey.

- about the great generosity of Master Dogen stating that everyone's life is blessed ( sentient and insentient) expressing the great love of the Bodhisattva, helping to realize that this very life is the place of liberation.","","Geoffrey Shugen Arnold","","","Religion & Spirituality","0:42:23 (approx)","2013 Winter"
30293,"Audio","Active","Mountain Record Editor","2013-01-05 00:00","67j","","Zen Center of New York City","Buddhadharma at the Beginning of the New Year","from Master Dogen's  Eihei Koroku
Is there Buddha Dharma in new year's day?
The teacher answers: "" Yes. This is an auspicious time. The myriad things are all new"". The student thanks the teacher for his answer. The teacher says: today, I have lost some virtue.
Another student asks the same question to another teacher, who answers: "" No. No Buddha Dharma in new year's day"".
Same question and apparently different answers.

During the Zazenkai discourse, Shugen focused on the second part of the koan.

Importance of beginnings and the level of preparedness required for each beginning.
He talked about the delight and the rejoicing in virtue necessary for true practice and how dedicating merits are essential, how heart/mind have to be unified.
While marking a beginning could be seen as artificial, we can sense in it the opportunity it offers even if it is part of a continuum.
Buddha dharma is the ultimate truth and the teachers answered from this truth, from this free place. It is not fixed and cannot be compared; it is the nature of everything, true all the time.
The buddha taught to look closer than what the senses inform us, look beyond the names. If we allow the mind to rest, we can experience that the qualities we thought were solid and fixed are not so.
For this relaxation to occur we need to have profound trusting in what is, not to create conflict in our mind; we have to get rid of plans and agenda to fit our purposes and move in accord with our true nature.
Teachers are dedicated to help their student see this ultimate truth and to trust the bare simplicity of their own mind.

Who Is It That's Binding You?



Acting From A Perceived Sense Of Self-existence Creates A Gap Between 'me' And What I Perceive. Although It Is An Illusion, This Gap Is The Cause Of All Suffering So We Try To Fill The Gap With Objects Such As Cars, Relationships, And So Forth. Once We Begin To See More Clearly, We Realize That We Are Responsible For For Our Own Mind And That We Don't Need To Be Saved Or Made Whole. We Can Discover Our Own Natural Completeness.","","","Geoffrey Shugen Arnold","Gateless Gate","9","Religion & Spirituality","0:39:35 (approx)","2014 Spring Ango"

As Hojin explains, papanka is the mental world we create with our thoughts, concretizing our mental experiences and calling them real, rather than practicing mindfulness and seeing reality itself. She discusses how papanka is a cause of suffering in our lives and how mindfulness frees us from its unwholesome influence. She sums up her talk with the advice of the Buddha: ""The best friend is a well-trained mind; the worst enemy is a poorly-trained mind.""","","Jody Hojin Kimmel","","","Religion & Spirituality","0:40:30 (approx)","2014"

“I wanted to talk today about story, and how the stories of women have helped me. And in particular two women I’ll take up today: Rengetsu who wrote this [poem, “Field of Wild Grasses”], who I have a real affinity for—I’ll tell you about her haughty life—and Patachara. Because, over these years, I’ve been looking for stores about loss and grief and how my ancestors practiced[….]

“[Rengetsu] found out what mattered most through these ruptures:

‘The evanescence of
This floating world
 I feel over and over:
It is hardest
To be the one left behind.
I can only sob
and sob.’

“She recognized impermanence was for real, not just on an intellectual level. And I remember how long that took, to really feel this is not going to last. […] The rupture is nature. It makes adjustments to what’s needed and what to trust in being it. She trusts in her not knowing the depths of wisdom and love that can open in a human heart—if we enter the journey into our darkness, back into the light, into our darkness, into the light. I like to call it ‘the beautiful-awful’.”","","Jody Hojin Kimmel","","","Religion and Spirituality","1:00:07 (approx)","2016 Fall"

. . . Weâ€™ve got a responsibility in this country. Nobody will chop your head off if you practice your religion. Youâ€™re not going to get thrown into jail â€“ not yet anyway - if you practice moral and ethical values. (Or, maybe you will go to jail. It depends on the kind of action you take. Sometimes thatâ€™s the price).

But, we have a responsibility. Itâ€™s called practice. And, practice means more than just sitting crosslegged on the pillow - more than just clarifying ourselves. The question is, â€œHow do you bring out the Dharma Jewel in your time, in your season? How do you follow the example of the Buddha, Nagarjuna, Asoka, the National Teachersâ€? Each time and season was different. Each Upaya was of a different form.

[Your] question is, â€œWhat is the form for you? Now? What is the form for your life? My life? How will you do it?â€

And most importantly, â€œWhen will you do it?â€ Keep in mind that you only have now to work with. Thereâ€™s nothing else.
