The Blue Cliff Record, K-61.
Fuketsu's One Particle of Dust, Master Ingo's Pointer.
To set up the banner of the teaching and establish its fundamental message is a matter for a
genuine master of the school.
To distinguish dragons and snakes, distinguish the initiate from the naive, one must be an
accomplished teacher.
As for discussing killing and giving life on the edge of a sword, discerning what is appropriate
for the moment with a staff, this I leave aside for the moment.
Just tell me in one phrase how you will assess the matter of occupying the heartland single-handedly.
To test, I cite this old case, listen, the main case.
Fuketsu, giving a talk, said, if you set up a single atom of dust, the nation flourishes.
If you do not set up a single atom of dust, the nation perishes.
Seto raised his staff and said, are there any patched row of monks who will live together
and die together?
That's the Seto's verse.
The old peasants may not unfurrow their brows, but for now I hope that the nation establishes
a sturdy foundation.
Crafty ministers, valiant generals, where are they now?
Ten thousand miles pure wind, only I know.
Setting up the banner of the teachings and establishing the fundamental teachings, the fundamental message
of the school, and we're at a period of time in our history of Zen and Buddhism in this country
where the banner of the teachings is being established all over the place, Buddhism is growing, the practice
is growing, it's now mostly very serious practitioners as opposed to twenty years ago
when it was mostly dilettantes talking about it.
Now it's a lot of hard practice that's going on.
Sometimes where the banner is set up it works, sometimes it doesn't.
Tango says to judge or distinguish dragons from snakes, initiate from naïve, we can even say
constructive from destructive, because wherever the teachings happen throughout history, if
you look at the history of Buddhism, you see that there have been times in its history
where all the forces were very destructive forces, other times where they were very constructive forces,
and yet somehow the Dharma continued, continued through incredible circumstances.
If you look into its history, you see how some of the destructive forces were emperors, were generals, were patrons of Buddhism, were artists or warriors,
sectarianism itself, other religions, power, sects, wealth, and the seekers of the way themselves have been destructive forces.
And China, emperors, just completely, the wave of their hand, destroy monasteries and monks.
Generals would plunder them.
Patrons themselves, by using their money and their power,
would take control of the monasteries.
And as a result of that control, the values and what the whole thing was about would change.
That's one of the reasons that Dogen was so emphatic about not taking any money from power people, from businesses or the emperor or the state.
He would throw a monk out of the monastery who was guilty of doing that.
It was considered, by him at that time, one of the most awful things you could do,
because he had witnessed how that resulted in lots of destruction of what the teachings were about.
During the whole period of the Song dynasty in China, the practice became so diluted that many historians regard the fact that it had become so culturally accessible
through the arts and the warriors that went to the monasteries, that that was the cause of the decline of Zen and Song Dynasty China.
There's a pretty strong argument even to support it.
Of course, the rivalry between various sects caused a lot of problems.
And needless to say, as always, throughout history, power, sects, and wealth have a way of tarnishing even the highest ideals.
But also, we mustn't forget that the seekers of the way themselves, the practitioners of the ways themselves,
sometimes have wreaked havoc on the practice, you know, unintentionally.
They don't mean to do it, it's not a deliberate thing, but it does happen.
The constructive forces in the history of Buddhism, on the other hand, are the emperors, the generals, the patrons, the artists, the warriors,
other religions, the sectarianism, and the seekers of the way.
They have been very powerful influences.
The very same thing that have been the destructive influences have been the positive influences.
The emperor Wu also built monasteries.
Another emperor destroyed monasteries, but one of them built them.
Many of the famous teachers came from the ranks of the warriors.
The patrons built monasteries.
The whole golden age of Zen and Tang Dynasty China and the Kamakura period of Japan
directly related to the support of those patrons and the fact that the artists and warriors' lives were being affected by the teachings.
And because their lives were affected, in the case of the artists, the audiences of those artists' lives were being affected also.
So it had a very beneficial thing.
The whole warrior clan began to look at what they were doing in a very different way.
It didn't stop them from being warriors and it didn't put an end to war, but at least it opened up a whole different way of perceiving what they were doing.
So there were beneficial sides to it as well as destructive sides to it.
And it's interesting when you look at the whole thing, when you look at what it is that we do in a monastery, how we practice, what a sangha is,
you begin to realize that we bring to our practice all the same things that we've got functioning in the outside world.
Exactly the same thing, they're no different.
And that the problems that we create outside of the monastery are precisely the problems that we'll create inside a monastery,
and for precisely the same reasons outside or inside.
So greed, anger, and ignorance, which are the direct cause of the problems that we have in marriages, relationship, national problems,
problems with what we do to the environment, how we deal with children, how we deal with the poor, the handicapped, race, gender, religion,
all of those conflicts that arise in the world arise out of greed, anger, and ignorance.
And we say, you know, this is wrong, it doesn't work, it's not right, so we leave that, we abandon that.
We go to the monastery, and in the monastery what happens is that same greed, anger, and ignorance is functioning.
It doesn't stop because you walk into the front door of a monastery or because you pass through the barrier gates of a guardian council.
It doesn't stop for a long time.
It takes years of practice to transform it, to change it.
So in the meantime, from ground zero through quite a distance in time, greed, anger, and ignorance is still functioning,
and sometimes we find that we're bringing it to our practice, we use it and turn it against the very process that can alleviate the suffering and transform our lives.
You know, I talked about it in the last session, it's a human nature, it's probably the nature of life that that happens.
There were, during the last session, a couple of physicians doing the session who had told me, and then again I saw it on a program on TV,
these are people that work in emergency rooms, trauma units, where they're dealing with people whose bodies are completely broken,
who are very close to death, who are just hanging on to their life, and they're working, trying to save them.
They're trying to give them oxygen, get the blood flowing, stop the breathing, and the very people that they're helping attack them,
fight them, hate them, yell at them, scream at them.
I watched it on television as they did these series on trauma units in the hospital in the Bronx,
that somebody came in with a shotgun blast and the doctor would be attacked by the guy that was bleeding,
as if he were the one that shot him with the shotgun.
And we see the same thing with animals, when they're in pain, you go over to help them,
you know, you're going to get bitten, you have to watch it.
And it's a kind of an interesting process, you know, it gets kind of crazy in the midst of that process,
before the thing begins to resolve itself into what we call healing.
There's a point in time between the initial pain and suffering and the application of aid,
and before that transforms into what we call healing and the process can begin to take place,
there's a real confrontation and conflict.
And the other side of that greed, anger and ignorance, of course, we speak of a lot.
You turn it around when that transformation finally takes place,
even when the first inklings of it begin to take place,
when there's a first awareness of it,
that the other side of the three poisons are the three virtues.
So greed, anger and ignorance are really no different than compassion, wisdom and enlightenment.
And that the only thing that makes the difference is the self.
When the self is present, those same forces, those same energies,
create greed because of separateness.
They create anger because of separateness.
And they create delusion or ignorance because of separateness.
And the minute the self disappears, the same force is there,
but now without a self to manifest itself against or off,
that greed is really nothing other than compassion,
in a sense a kind of a greediness for the whole universe,
a desire to take care of everyone the way you would take care of yourself.
So it no longer is self-centered,
and the anger becomes wisdom,
and the ignorance becomes enlightenment,
realizing the nature of the self, no separation.
But a single speck of self, or as Foketsu puts it,
a single particle of dust in a nation appears.
The ten thousand things appear.
Heaven and earth appear.
All of the differences and differentiations
and everything that goes with it appears.
It's the nature of the beast.
Self disappears, all of those things disappear.
And yet, when all of those things disappear,
there is no functioning.
There is no functioning in emptiness.
It doesn't work.
There's nothing you can do in that state of consciousness.
Yet, on the other side of that, when all of that's there,
we have life and death and good and bad
and heaven and earth and pain and confusion
and greed, anger and ignorance.
And that's the dilemma, basically, of practice.
That in order for that thing to work at all,
it needs to manifest in the world of differentiation itself.
And basically, that's what this koan is addressing.
It becomes kind of a touchy thing.
And I watched it in our own history here,
in the early days when the banner was first unfurled.
Brand new sangha.
The scales were tipped in the favor of people brand new to practice.
And suddenly we had a large number of people here
at each other's throats.
I mean, those first days were hell on wheels
because people were trying to do here
what they were doing outside and it doesn't work.
So there were all kinds of conflicts going on
and destructive forces at work.
And it was touch and go for quite a while.
It was very close, as it has been in many other sanghas,
very close to actually being totally debilitated
by the very people that came together
in order to resolve the questions, the problems,
that were being caused on the outside.
But, of course, what they were bringing was themselves
and all of what that means.
And when you get a bunch of selves banging heads with each other,
the result is obvious.
And the negative things that were happening weren't negative.
They were well-meaning.
They were definitely well-meaning.
And they were justifiable.
And you found at the beginning,
you know, people would say,
well, why aren't we doing —
you know, Buddhism is such-and-such.
Why don't we do this, that, and the other thing,
which is good work, good action?
And the answer was, we're not strong enough.
We're barely able to stay afloat the way we are.
And if we take our energy and begin to dissipate it,
doing all of these works of compassion,
very quickly there will be no one to do it
because the whole structure will form.
It's kind of like a lifeboat, you know.
Lifeboats have a very definite capacity.
And if it's a lifeboat that can hold fifty people,
when you begin to try to put a hundred people into it —
in other words, do more than the capacity of it allows —
you no longer have a lifeboat, you have a deathboat.
Nobody survives.
The boat sinks and there's a hundred people floating around.
So, in the beginning there's a lot of discrimination.
Dragons and snakes, initiate from naive,
picking and choosing, doing it and not doing.
Years later, as we are now,
that lifeboat has grown large, its capacity and strong.
It can hold a lot. It can do a lot.
Its hull is really solid.
You can't punch a hole into it too easily.
The balance is tipped.
Now, there are lots of senior students,
there are lots of mature students after ten years of practice.
A strong board of directors, a strong organizational structure,
so that we can balance new students against more practiced or matured students.
And lifeboat capacity increases,
and the crew is trained,
and we're able to do all of those things that we couldn't do seven years ago.
Still not enough.
Still many more things that we can do.
But there's a lot of good work, compassionate work.
We can take pieces of ourselves and give,
and know that we can nourish without bringing the whole structure down around us.
That takes time.
It takes practice.
It takes a strong Sangha.
It takes that incredible Dharma that's inside of each one of us.
The process that turns the poisons to the virtues.
That pivotal thing.
The question,
how does that transformation from poison to virtue take place?
What it's about?
Where's the truth to be found?
You can't function when there's no speck of dust,
when there's nothing,
yet with a speck of dust all the problems.
Muketsu says,
If you set up a single speck of dust, the nation flourishes.
If you do not set up a single speck of dust, the nation perishes.
When he's talking about flourish and perish, he's talking about coming into being and disappearing.
In the little footnotes to these, it says if you set up a single speck of dust, the footnote says,
I am king of all things, and the autonomous master of all things, clusters of flowers, clusters of brocade.
And clusters of flowers and clusters of brocade refer to spring and autumn.
And spring and autumn, in turn, symbolize birth and death.
They have both negative connotations and have positive connotations.
Birth being the ten thousand things, the whole phenomenal universe.
The death being the absolute, no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.
But it also means the dichotomy of good, bad, up, down, heaven, earth, right, wrong.
In the next line he says, if you do not set up a single atom of dust, the footnote says,
he sweeps away the tracks, obliterates the traces.
Having lost his eyes, his nostrils are gone too.
The fact is, everything is gone.
And you don't give rise to a single atom of dust.
And then the last line is, the nation perishes.
The footnote says, everywhere the light shines, what is the use of the nation?
This entirely the business of his house.
This is entirely the business of his house.
And then Setsho puts in his comment and says, as he raises his staff,
the footnote said, one must stand high like a mile high wall to accomplish this.
Bodhidharma has come.
And then Setsho says, are there any adepts in this assembly who will live together and die together?
He's asking amongst his assembly who it is that's prepared to carry on the Dharma,
to manifest it in the world, to not only practice it but to realize it.
Ingo says, if you set up a single atom of dust, the nation flourishes.
If you don't, it perishes.
Tell me, is it right to set up an atom of dust or is it right not to set up an atom of dust?
And that's basically the koan.
Which of these two extremes?
Of course you can say, well, neither of these extremes.
It's not in phenomena and it's not in emptiness.
Fine.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
I agree.
What is it?
What does it mean to fall into neither of those?
Ingo says, when you get here, your great function must become manifest before you understand.
Even if you can grasp it before it's spoken of, this is still remaining in the shell, being limited.
Even if you can thoroughly penetrate it in a single phrase, you still won't avoid insane views on the way.
Is there any hope?
Fuketsu was part of Rinzai's lineage, a very accomplished teacher.
In the verse there's a reference to the necessity of relying on crafty ministers and valiant generals,
and that after that the unicorn appears, the phoenix soars, the signs of great peace.
So is it necessary to be crafty, valiant, is that what he's saying, in order to do this,
in order to transform those three poisons into the three virtues, in order to complete that process,
and at the same time that that process is taking place, not bring down everything around us.
You know, it's very nice to go out manifesting the three virtues and nourish everybody you come in contact with.
And you don't have to do anything special to do that just to have realized those virtues.
It nourishes.
Well, it's true also of the three poisons.
You don't have to do anything just to have those things functioning in your own body and mind.
It poisons.
That's why it's important to be aware that awareness is the beginning.
The awareness is what happens in the beginning of practice.
The first time we begin to sit down, we begin to realize what it is that we're manifesting with our thoughts.
When our thoughts are karma or action, they do.
When those thoughts spring from compassion, the result is nourishment, healing.
When they spring from greed, the result is pain, separation, suffering.
It's very simple.
Same person.
Same body.
Same mind.
And sometimes we bounce back and forth even between these things.
How to affect the change.
And the whole thing is dependent upon that illusion of the self.
How much holding on to that self-centeredness happens.
How much of what we do is self-centered, not being seen from the perspective of the totality
of things, of the total interaction, interdependency, co-origination of all things.
But our self, just the self, as if it really existed.
When you do not set up a single atom of dust, the nation perishes.
The wind blows chill.
Engo says that in the Soto lineage, they call this the point of transformation.
There is no more Buddha, nor sentient beings, no affirmation, no negation, no good or bad.
It is beyond sound, an echo, track or trace.
That's why it's said, although gold dust is precious, in the eye it obstructs vision.
And here he's referring to attachment, Dharma attachment, one of the sicknesses of our practice.
Attachment to the Buddha Dharma, to the teaching of enlightenment.
Even the Dharma, even enlightenment, needs to be abandoned.
Let alone delusion, ignorance, or that which is not the Dharma.
So it's not a matter of just letting go of the three poisons.
It's even a matter of letting go of the three virtues.
And where's the key to all of this?
How can we function if we stay in that one place?
How can there be peace if we're caught up in the phenomena and the poisons?
Lonson said to his community that 700 eminent monks all studied at Obai.
They all were people who understood the Buddha Dharma.
Not one of them got the bowl and the robe of the fifth ancestor.
Only the workman Liu, who didn't understand the Buddha Dharma, got the bowl and the robe.
And, of course, here he's talking about the sixth patriarch was the workman Liu,
the illiterate woodcutter who came to that community and became the sixth ancestor.
No education, no understanding, wasn't a monk, and yet it happened.
What he saw was that place that falls into neither extreme.
What he realized and what he manifested in his life was that place that falls into neither extreme.
Our problem is as we come into our practice looking for, filled with all kinds of wants,
and of course that want, I want enlightenment, I want this and I want that,
immediately makes the objective the primary concern of our practice.
And we miss the practice itself.
That's why Dogen emphasizes practice and enlightenment as one thing,
process and goal as one reality.
We can't exist one without the other.
If we get caught up into either one of the extremes, we miss the other.
We need to see that there are two parts of the same reality.
If you're caught in the process, you miss the goal.
There are people with no goals and so their life is diffused.
They don't go anywhere.
There are other people who are so intent on the goal that they miss the process.
They don't know what the hell they're doing.
They wouldn't even know the goal if they stumbled on it because of their preoccupation with it.
But the process and the goal are the same reality.
This very moment contains them both, practice and enlightenment, process and goal.
We want guarantees.
If I do this, that and the other, will I get it?
We want success, very important.
We want a win, very important.
Well, guarantees, looking for guarantees.
It's like saying I'm not responsible.
Will you mind taking the responsibility for me?
Guarantee it for me.
Then I don't have to take the responsibility.
Responsibility, as I mentioned yesterday in that wedding ceremony, is the ability to respond.
It's continuous.
It's a continuum.
It's not just a thought or a state of mind.
It's action.
Karma.
And all you've got is responsibility because there aren't any guarantees.
There is no hope.
And indeed, you are responsible.
In fact, the whole catastrophe is in your hands, whether you like it or not.
The question is, what will you do with it?
This is not a philosophical question or a philosophical discussion.
It's real.
We're talking about your life.
So, Setsho, at the end of the corn, having raised both sides of it, lifts up his staff and says,
is there anybody here who will live together and die together?
And Ingo says, if there had been…
If at that time there had been someone who would have come forth to utter a phrase, alternately acting as guest and host,
he would have avoided this old fellow, Setsho, ultimately pointing to himself in the end.
Nobody came forth.
It's kind of an interesting process, the forging of the sword of wisdom and compassion,
the sword of Manjushri, this dragon sword of Manjushri.
We start the process.
We're looking for the right combination of the metals to give us just the right amount of hardness,
but not too brittle, just the right amount of softness to have flexibility,
but still enough to hold an edge.
That's our practice.
And then we practice shaping it into a sword.
And then we forge it, heat it, hammer it, cool it, heat it, hammer it, cool it.
And while this is going on, everybody's working on their own sword.
There's stealing, lying, competitiveness.
How come his sword is bigger than my sword?
My sword's better than your sword.
Yet the process continues, somehow, in the midst of all of that.
That's what the structure is about.
That's what the matrix is about.
Sometimes the person needs to be left alone to work with it, make the mistakes.
Other times they need to be guided step by step.
Sometimes you take the sword away and hide it before it's finished.
Sometimes someone shows you a beautiful sword and says,
Look, look what I've done.
And you turn away and walk away from them.
Other times someone with a miserable sword says,
I can't do it.
You say, it's wonderful what you're doing.
Great work, it's the best sword I've ever seen.
And the process continues.
The edges are made.
And you sharpen it.
And you sharpen both sides.
The side that's wisdom and the side that's compassion.
All of this is still practice.
And you look at that sword, you examine it.
You may even use it.
It's still not yet there.
And then suddenly one day you realize that this beautiful sword that you forged,
you always had it.
You always had it.
You didn't have to create it.
You didn't have to make it.
And at that moment the two swords become one sword.
Then it's realized.
Nobody can take it away from you.
Of course nobody gave it to you.
And you didn't make it.
It always was you.
All that diamond sword of Manjushri is the sword that's the life of each one of us.
One side of it kills.
The other side of it gives life.
One side of it is wisdom.
The other side of it is compassion.
One part of it manifests the lotus flower.
The other the lotus leaves.
Only a true dragon can wield a dragon sword.
Does anyone know how to wield a dragon sword?
Are there any dragons?
What is the wisdom?
What is the killing side?
What is the killing side?
No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind.
What is compassion?
What is the life giving side?
Medicine and sickness.
Healing each other.
All the world is medicine.
Then where is the place that's neither killing or giving life?
The sword itself.
What's that?
And this mountain is a place to train dragons.
Our practice is to forge that sword of wisdom and compassion.
It's only when we've done that, that we can bring peace, not only to ourselves and our life, but to everything that's around us.
And the power to do it is in the hands of each one of us.
But only us, only you can do it.
It can't be given to you.
It can't be done for you.
And the miracle of it all is it's always been there.
Setsho says,
Old peasants may not unfurrow their brows, but for now I hope that the nation establishes a sturdy foundation.
The ministers and generals, where are they now?
Ten thousand miles of pure wind.
Only I know.
That's Setsho nodding to himself since no one would respond.
He put out a call for the ministers and generals.
And basically what he's talking about there is the adepts.
Those who will do it.
Those who will, in spite of barrier after barrier that confronts us, manifest that wisdom and compassion.
That's the life of each one of us.
We have the potential of both.
On the one hand, we can manifest the poisons, and we do.
On the other hand, we can manifest the virtues, and we do.
The question is, how do we get rid of both of them, and give life to the Buddha, where there's not a particle of dust, and there's not no dust at all?
Let's talk to them, and let my children 먹어� back home.
Anjubo-san under penBook.
We get rid of both things during the classes.
We want to answer these questions.
We do.
Let go.
To come home, how do you want?
The komen atidas promet.
The one being started Sundays.
The time of this infant, it was too close to many living in the life.
The two on the planet.
