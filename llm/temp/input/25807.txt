Master Dogen's 300 Koan Shobogenzo, Case 106,
Tian Do Dao's Essential Dharma Gate.
The main case.
Priest Long Tan was making rice cakes for a living when he met Priest Tian Dao.
He bowed and left his household.
Tian Dao said,
Be my attendant, and from now on I will teach you the essential Dharma gate.
After one year passed, Long Tan said,
When I arrived, you said that you would teach me the essential Dharma gate.
I haven't received any of your instruction as yet.
Tian Dao said,
I have been teaching you for a long time.
Long Tan said,
What have you been teaching me?
Tian Dao said,
When you greet me, I join my palms.
When I sit, you stand beside me.
When you bring me tea, I receive it from you.
Long Tan was silent for a while.
Tian Dao said,
When you see it, you just see it.
When you think about it, you miss it.
Long Tan then had great enlightenment.
The Commentary
Long Tan came looking for iron and found gold.
Blinded by expectation,
He could not see the Master's grandmotherly kindness
In following him around
And pointing out
That which is high
And that which is low.
But say,
Is Tai Ando's teaching the same or different
Than Long Tan's making of rice cakes
Before he was ordained?
If you say the same,
You have not yet seen
What Long Tan realized.
If you say different,
You don't understand
Tai Ando's teaching.
Since the truth is not to be found
In these two places,
In the end,
Where do you go to find it?
The Tapping Verse
Within darkness there is light,
But don't look for that light.
Within light there is darkness,
But do not try to understand
That darkness.
This koan, as many of you know,
Is part of the
300 koan Shobo Ginzo
Of Master Dogen
It's a collection
Of 300 koans
That Dogen did
While he was in China
Studying with Jujing
And it's essentially unknown
In the States
There are Japanese translations
Of these 300 koans
But none in English as yet
And so
Kaz Tanahishi and I
Are in the process
Of translating them
To English
We've actually translated
All 300 of them
And I'm in the process
Of adding commentaries
And tapping verses
To each of them
These koans
Are really important
To any student
Of the Dharma
Particularly Zen
And particularly
Soto and Rinzai Zen
Dogen, as many of you may know
Did receive
The transmission
Of the Rinzai lineage
Before he received
The transmission
Of the Soto lineage
And so he did
Koan study
Although legend
Would have it
Soto school legend
Would have it
That Dogen was opposed
To koan study
And this clearly
Is not the case
Did he ever put down
Koan study
He most certainly did
Along with
10,000 other things
Wherever he found
People sticking
He was very quick
To cut it loose
But he indeed
Used koan study
In his own teaching
These 300 koans
Were the seeds
That created
What's called
The Japanese
Shobogenzo
So there are two
Shobogenzos
Of Dogen
One is
The 300 koan
Shobogenzo
And the other
Is the
Just plain
Shobogenzo
Written in Japanese
One was written
In Chinese
One was written
In Japanese
And so if you look
At his Shobogenzo
Which is his
Masterwork
You'll find
Sprinkled throughout it
Many of these
300 koans
And of course
He deals with them
In the Shobogenzo
And he deals with them
In a very
Very different way
Many of them
He deals with
In terms of
The five ranks
Of Master Tozan
Which is another
Legend
Soto school legend
That Dogen
Was opposed
To the five ranks
Did he put them down?
Indeed he did
Did he use them?
Indeed he did
He didn't talk about them
He just used them
They're integrated
In everything
He does
In the Shobogenzo
The five ranks
Have to do
With the integration
Of absolute
And relative
We have a tendency
To see things
Dualistically
We either see
One side
Or the other side
Either this
Or that
Either absolute
Or relative
Heaven or earth
Monk practice
Lay practice
In the monastery
In the world
And what the five ranks
Do
Is show
The complete
Interpenetration
Codependency
And mutual arising
Of the dualities
The interesting
Thing about this
Koan
Is that
Tayando
Tayandao
Is a
Successor
Of Sikito
And Sikito
Is the person
That wrote
The identity
Of relative
And absolute
That we chant
Each day
And that
Of course
Is the
Statement
Of the integration
Of dualities
That period
Of time
In the history
Of
Chinese
Zen
There was
The Huiyen
School
Which talked
About the
Four
Dhammadatus
And there's
A whole
School of
Zen
That was
Based on
That
So the
Seeds
Of the
Five ranks
Were in
The air
And Sikito
Used the
Teachings
Of the
Four
Dhammadatus
In writing
The identity
Of relative
And absolute
And that
Went down
A few more
Generations
And in the
Hands of
Tozan
And Sozan
They became
The Five ranks
And that
Continued
To be
Transmitted
In both
The Rinzai
And Soto
Schools
Down to the
Present time
It's
One of the
Things that
Comes to
The end
Of training
The koans
Of the
Five ranks
So Sikito
Had
Transmitted
To
Tayando
The teacher
In this
Case
Tayando
And Sikito
Also
Transmitted
To the line
That ended
Up with
Tozan
Which is
Our lineage
Tayando
Transmitted
To Longtan
Longtan
You may
Recognize
The Japanese
Name
Ryutan
And Ryutan
Was the
Old monk
That
Toksan
Or
Deshan
Went to
See
Deshan
As you
Recall
Was a
Young
Scholar
On the
Diamond
Sutra
That lived
In the
Northern
Part of
China
And he
Was an
Expert
Known
Throughout
China
For his
Expertise
On the
Diamond
Sutra
And a
Great
Lecturer
Held in
Extremely
High
Regard
And when
He
Heard
Of the
Direct
Mind
To
Mind
Transmission
That was
Going
On in
The
South
Of
China
He
Decided
That he
Was going
To go
South
And
Disprove
These
Heretics
So he
Packed
Up his
Backpack
Full of
Diamond
Sutra
Commentaries
And headed
South
And on
The
Journey
He ran
Into
A woman
On the
Roadside
Selling
Rice
Cakes
Or
Cakes
And he
Tried to
Buy one
And she
Said that
And tea
And she
Said what
Are you
Carrying
Around in
That pack
Of yours
And he
Said the
Diamond
Sutra
And she
Said oh
The Diamond
Sutra
She said do
You know
Anything about
The Diamond
Sutra
And he
Said yes
I'm an
Expert
On it
I'm a
Lecturer
On it
And
She
Said well
I'll
Tell you
What
I'll
Give you
A free
Cup
Of tea
And a
Free
Cake
If you
Can answer
Me a
Question about
The Diamond
Sutra
If you
Can't answer
It I
Won't
Serve you
So of
Of course
Deshan
Was
Completely
Confident
And he
Said go
Ahead
Ask
And she
Said well
In that
Diamond
Sutra
It says
Past
Mind
Cannot
Be
Grasped
Present
Mind
Cannot
Be
Grasped
Future
Mind
Cannot
Be
Grasped
Is
This
So
Yes
A quoted
Section and
Verse
For her
And she
Said well
In that
Case
With which
Mind
Will you
Accept this
Tea and
Cake
Deshan
Was
Completely
Flabbergasted
He had
No sense
Of how
To
Answer
Needless
To say
He didn't
Get the
Cup of
Tea
Either
And so
He wanted
To know
Where he
Could go
And study
And learn
About this
Way of
Dealing
With the
Dharma
And she
Directed
Him to
Ryutan
And Ryutan
Was the
One that
Brought
Deshan
To
Enlightenment
The thing
That tickles
Me about
This is
The karmic
Interrelationships
Mind
Boggling
When you
Think of
The thousands
And thousands
Of monasteries
And practitioners
Scattered
All over
China
How
Certain
Lines
Of
Dharma
Flowered
There were
Five houses
Of Zen
In China
In the
Golden
Age
Three of
Those five
Houses
Came
Directly
Out of
This line
That we're
Talking
About
Three of
Them
Deshan
Went
On to
Be the
Teacher
Of
Guifeng
Or
Seppo
And
Seppo
As you
Remember
Was
Not
Too
Swift
Seppo
And Ganto
Studied
Together
With
Deshan
Ganto
Came to
Realization
When he
Was
About
30
Years
Of
Age
Seppo
Was
55
And he
Still
Hadn't
Realized
It
He
Had
Been
Practicing
About
30
35
Years
They
They
Tried
Everything
Deshan
And
Guansha
To bring
Him to
Enlightenment
But
Nothing
Worked
And
And
Finally
They
Went
Off
On
A
Pilgrimage
Together
And
It
Was
During
That
Pilgrimage
That
Seppo
Had
A
Deep
Enlightenment
He
Went
On
To
Transmit
To
Unman
Or
Yunman
And
Through
His
Transmission
Feyen
School
Appeared
And
The
Unman
School
Appeared
And
On
The
Other
End
Of
Things
The
Tozan
School
Appeared
It's
Pretty
Remarkable
All
Of
That
Came
Out
Of
This
Seed
That
Was
Planted
By
Shitao
The
Beginning
Of
These
Three
Incredible
Lineages
Of
The
Dharma
And
So
In
The
Meeting
First
Time
Long
Tan
Was
A
Lay
Practitioner
And
His
Profession
Was
Making
Rice
Cakes
For
A
Living
And
Evidently
When
He
Met
Thayan
Dao
He
Was
Convinced
That
This
Was
The
Teacher
To
Follow
Evidently
Had
Some
Sort
Of
A
Calling
And
So
It
Says
Simply
He
Bowed
And
Left
His
Household
It
Means
Basically
That
He
Became
Ordained
As
One
Of
Thayan
Dao's
Monks
And
Thayan
Dao
Said
Be
My
Attendant
Be
My
Jisha
And
From
Now
On
I
Will
Teach
You
The
Essential
Dharma
Gate
And
He
Joined
Them
A
Year
Past
Nothing
Happened
Long
Ton
Said
When
I
Arrived
You
Said
That
You
Would
Teach
Me
The
Essential
Dharma
Gate
I
Haven't
Received
Any
Of
Your
Instructions
Yet
This
Is
An
Old
Story
You
You'll
See
This
You'll
See
This
Pop
Up
In
Lots
Of
Stories
In
Martial
Arts
Dharma
In
Fact
It
Was
Even
In
The
Karate
Kid
You
Remember
The
Karate
Kid
Movie
You
Went
To
Study
With
The
Old
Man
And
The
Old
Man
Said
Clean
The
Car
Sweep
The
Place
Cook
The
Meal
And
He
Saying
What
What's
Going
On
Here
I
Didn't
Come
To
Be
A
Servant
Similar
Thing
Happened
In
The
Case
Of
This
Young
Man
Who
Wanted
To
Be
A
Swordsman
So
He
Went
To
The
Teacher
And
He
Said
Please
Teach
Me
And
Teacher
Says
I
I'm
Retired
I'm
Not
Taking
Any
Swordsman
My
Grandfather
Was
The
Swordsman
I
Really
Need
To
Go
Away
I
Don't
Want
To
Teach
You
And
But
The
Kid
Kept
Being
Persistent
And
Finally
He
Said
I
Really
Really
Want
To
Do
This
It
Wasn't
Because
Of
His
Father
And
His
Grandfather
It
Was
Because
He
Really
Wanted
To
Do
It
And
The
Old
Man
Accepted
Him
And
Said
Okay
Clean
The
Garden
And
When
You
Get
Cooking
And
He
Was
Cleaning
And
He
Was
Raking
The
Garden
And
Year
Went
By
And
He
Was
Being
Quiet
About
It
And
Knowing
That
This
Sort
Of
Thing
Happens
And
Little
By
Little
He
Started
Getting
Impatient
And
Finally
He
Said
You
Know
Look
Old
Man
I
Didn't
Come
Here
To
Be
Your
Servant
When
Will
You
Start
Teaching
Me
And
The
Old
Man
Who
Was
Teaching
Him
All
Along
Took
The
Bamboo
Pole
That
He
Had
And
Whacked
Him
With
It
And
Then
From
That
Moment
On
Every
Time
The
Kid
Was
Working
The
Old
Man
Would
Leap
Out
Of
Nowhere
And
Hit
Him
With
The
Stick
Until
Finally
You
Know
Two
Three
Months
Of
This
Goes
By
And
He
Got
Him
Every
Time
And
The
Kid
Was
Like
25
Years
Old
And
The
Old
Man
Was
In
His
Eighties
And
Was
Like
You
Know
Constantly
On
Raw
Nerved
Waiting
For
Him
To
Pop
Up
And
The
Second
He
Would
Relax
Whack
He
Get
Hit
And
Then
Finally
His
Whole
Thing
Changed
To
Being
Pissed
Off
And
He
Said
He
Cut
Himself
A
Bamboo
Switch
And
He
Hit
Himself
Because
He
Knew
The
Old
Man
Every
Morning
Had
The
Same
Old
Routine
He
Get
Up
He
Kind
of
Stumble
Out
Onto
The
Patio
There
Was
A
Big
Bowl
And
A
Stump
And
He
Stick
His
Head
In
The
Bowl
And
Wash
His
Face
That
That's
When
He
Was
Going
To
Get
Him
When
His
Head
Was
In
The
Bowl
And
So
He
Hid
There
And
Waited
And
As
The
Old
Man
Stuck
His
Head
In
The
Bowl
The
Kid
Came
Out
With
A
Bamboo
Swish
And
Before
He
Knew
It
The
Old
Man
Took
It
Away
From
Him
And
Was
Whacking
Him
With
It
And
Supposedly
At
That
Point
He
Became
Enlightened
And
Whatever
So
The
Same
Thing
Is
Going
On
Here
You
Know
I
Came
Here
To
You
Said
You
Were
Going
To
Teach
Me
And
I
Haven't
Received
Any
Of
Your
Instruction
Yet
And
Tayando
Said
Well
I
Been
Teaching
You
For
A
Long
Time
And
Long
Time
Says
What
Have
You
Been
Teaching
Me
And
Tayando
Said
When
You

Me
I
Join
My

When
I
Sit
You
Stand
Beside
Me
When
You
Bring
Me
Tea
I

It
From
You
These
Are
All
The
Jobs
Of
A
Jisha
And
The
Teacher
Would
Respond
To
That
And
Hearing
This
Long
Time
Was
Silent
And
Tayando
Said
When
You
See
It
You
Just
See
It
When
You
Think
About
It
You
Miss
It
And
At
That
Point
Long

An

How

The

Even
In
47

Never

It
So
How
Is
This
Guy
Going
To
Do
It
How
Can
Any
Teacher
Do
It
That's
What
Dogo
Was
Talking
About
When
He
Said
In
All
Of
China
There
Are
No
Zen
Teachers
And
A
Monk
Said
Well
Then
Who
Are
All
These
People
Are
Running
Monasteries
And
Dogo
Said
I
Didn't
Say
That
There
Was
No
Dharma
There
Was
No
Zen
I
Said
There
No
Zen
Teachers
There
Is
A
Saying
In
Zen
That
Anything
That
Comes
In
Through
The
Gate
Is
Not
The
Family
Treasure
Something
From
The
Outside
And
If
You
Grab
On
To
That
You
Missed
It
Because
The
Truth
Each
One
Of
Us
Already
Contains
And
The
Only
Place
That
You
Are
Going
To
Find
It
Is
Deep
Within
You
Yourself
And
All
A
Teacher
Can
Do
Is
Point
That's
The
Upaya
That's
The
Upaya
That
You
Were
Hearing
About
Last
Week
In
The
Lotus
Sutra
The
Buddha
The
Upaya
Here
Is
From
Now
On
I
Will
Teach
You
The
Essential
Dharma

Even
Though
He
Knew
He
Couldn't
Do
It
He
Was
Deliberately
Offensive
Knowingly
Offensive
After
One

Past

When

You
Said
You

Teach
Me
The
Essential

Kate
I
Haven't
Received
Any
Of
Your
Instruction
As
Yet
Footnote
Says
The
Gap
Is
Enormous
He
Can't
Even
See
The
Other
Side
Of
It
There's
No
Idea
What's
Going
On
One
Of
The
Things
They
Do
In
Japanese
Monasteries
Is
There's
No
Verbal
Instruction
Given
At
All
Here
We
Rehearse
For
Something
Fifteen
Times
A
Day
There
No
Instruction
So
You
Enter
The
Monastery
Somebody
Points
To
Your
Seat
You
Are
Complete
Novice
You
Have
No
Idea
What
What's
Going
On
And
Everybody
That's
In
There
Is
Your
Senior
And
Everybody
Knows
Who
Their
Senior
Is
Without
Any
Insignia
Or
Anything
Everybody
Knows
Who's
Senior
It's
Just
Like
Chickens
You
Know
The
Pecking
Order
With
Chickens
Every
Chicken
Knows
Who
It
Can
Peck
And
Who
It
Can't
Peck
No
Matter
How
They
Mix
Them
Up
They
Always
Figure
Out
The
Pecking
Order
And
So
The
Minute
You
Do
Anything
You
Made
A
Mistake
Somebody
Yells
They
Don't
Tell
You
How
To
Do
It
They
Just
Yell
And so
In a
Very
Short
Period
Of
Time
You
Become
An
Astute
Observer
Of
Incredible
Subtleties
You
See
Everything
And you
Absorb
Everything
And that's
How you
Learn
Little
By
Little
Day
After
Day
This
Guy
Had
No
Idea
That
He
Was
Being

So
Tayando

So
I
Haven't
Received
Any

Yet
Tayando

I've
Been

You
For
A

When

Says
Great
Foamy

That's
A Zen
Metaphor
For
Something
That
Completely
Encompasses
The

So
How
Is
That
Joining
My

Standing
Beside

And
Receiving
It
How
Is
That
Encompassing
The
Whole

That's
Something
To
Appreciate
If
You
To

This
Go
On
Long

Was
Silent
For
A
While
Footnote
Says
Uh
Oh
He's
Gone
The
Permutations
And
Combinations
Can
Be
Endless
That's
What
Happens
So
Many
Times
When
I
See
Somebody
In
Doksan
And
They're
Stuck
Somewhere
And I
Want
To
Help
And so
I
Say
A
Word
Or
Two
And
They
Sit
There
And I
Can
See
The
Computer
Start
And I
Beg
Forgiveness
Of all
The
Ancestors
For
Polluting
This
Guy's
Mind
Probably
I
Should
Hit
Him
With
A
Stick
Or
Something
But
That
Doesn't
Work
In
America
And so
I
Go
On
Creating
Pollution
It's
Hard
To
Avoid
Because
That's
The
Way
We
Were
Brought
Up
Right
That's
What
Our
Parents
Taught
Us
That's
What
Our
Teachers
Have
Taught
Us
That's
What
Our
Education
Has
Taught
Us
That's
How
We
Have
Won
Gold
Stars
Went
To
The
Front
Of
The
Class
Been
A
Success
In
Life
Proven
Ourselves
Or
That's
How
We
Failed
That's
How
We
Haven't
Been
A
Success
So
However
However
You
Want
To
Cut
It
It's
All
Got
To
Do
With
Your
Thinking
And
What
You
Know
And
Here
Suddenly
Is
A
Whole
Different
Realm
Where
Not
Knowing
Is
It's
Not
About
Believing
It's
About
Realizing
So
A
Whole
Other
Aspect
Of
Consciousness
Needs
To
Come
Into
Play
Before
We
Can
Connect
But
The
Thing
Is
Is
That
The
Minute
There's
A
Question
Bingo
We're
In
High
Gear
Intellectual
High
Gear
Worrying
Away
And
Even
When
People
See
Koans
Even
When
They've
Seen
It
Truly
Seen
It
Within
24
Hours
It's
Lost
All
Of
Its
All
Of
Its
Key
It's
Been
Thoroughly
Digested
Intellectualized
Categorized
And
Put
Into
The
Filing
Cabinet
That's
One
Of
The
Reasons
Why
We
Have
To
Keep
Doing
Them
Over
And
Over
And
Over
That's
Why
There's
750
Of
Them
That's
Why
It
Takes
15
Years
To
Finish
It
Because
Those
That
Conditioning
Goes
Very
Very
Deep
It
Goes
Deep
Because
It
Starts
At
Such
An
Early
Age
And
Because
It
Is
Constantly
Reinforced
By
The
Society
In
Which
We
Live
It's
Reinforced
By
The
Media
It's
Reinforced
By
Theater
It's
Reinforced
By
Art
It's
Reinforced
By
Poetry
By
Advertising
By
Education
By
Politics
By
Sociology
All
Of
That
Is
Based
On
A
Dualistic
View
Of
The
Universe
What
Would
Would
It
Be
Like
If
We
Were
To
See
Through
The
Eyes
Of
The
Non
Dual
Dharma
I'm
Not
Talking
About
Seeing
Through
The
Eyes
Of
Sunyata
Because
The
Eyes
Of
Sunyata
Are
Blind
There
Is
No
Eye
Ear
Nose
Tongue
Body
Or
Mind
I'm
Not
Talking
About
Seeing
Through
The
Eyes
Of
Differentiation
Of
This
And
That
I'm
Talking
About
The
Place
Where
They
Meet
The
Place
Where
The
Two
Arrows
Meet
The
Next
Line
Tayandao
Says
When
You
See
It
You
Just
See
It
Footnote
Says
Body
And
Mind
Filling
The
Universe
That's
What
Token
Calls
Whole
Body
And
Mind
Seeing
Whole
Body
And
Mind
Seeing
Is
Not
About
Just
Seeing
With
The
Eyes
It's
About
Seeing
With
The
Ear
And
Hearing
With
The
Eye
Then
He
Said
When
You
Think
About
It
You
Miss
It
Footnote
Says
Like
Leaves
Scattered
In
The
Ten
Directions
Long
Tan
Then
Got
A
Great
Enlightenment
Footnote
Says
No
Gaps
No
Separation
That's
What
It
Means
That's
What
Enlightenment
Really
Means
Simply
That
No
Gaps
Long
Tan
Came
In
The
Commentary
Long
Tan
Came
Looking
For
Iron
But
Found
Gold
Blinded
By
Expectation
He
Could
Not
See
The
Master's
Grandmotherly
Kindness
In
Following
Him
Around
Pointing
Out
That
Which
Is
High
And
That
Which
Is
Low
Expectations
Blinded
By
Expectations
That's
The
Killer
Probably
It's
The
Biggest
Single
Item
That
We
Deal
With
In
Residential
Training
People's
Expectations
They get
Bigger
And
More
Convoluted
The
More
Books
On
Zen
That
Are
Published
And
Right
Now
There
Are
Just
Hundreds
Of
Them
So
People
Come
In
With
All
Kinds
Of
Ideas
About
The
Way
Things
Should
Be
Or
Shouldn't
Be
What
A
Teacher
Is
Or
Isn't
What
The
Dharma
Is
Or
Isn't
When
I
Teach
The
Course
On
Photography
I
Run
Into
The
Same
Thing
I
Give
People
A
Visual
Kahn
And
I
Ask
Them
To
Go
Out
And
Photograph
That
Koan
Without
Expectation
To
Go
Out
And
Allow
Themselves
To
Discover
Their
Subject
Or
Better
Yet
Let
The
Subject
Discover
Them
Whether
It's
A
Rock
Or
A
Mountain
Or
A
Person
Or
An
Animal
Doesn't
Matter
But
That
If
They
Go
Out
With
Expectation
If
They
Know
What
They're
Looking
For
There are
Only
Two
Possibilities
One
Is
That
They'll
Find
What
They're
Looking
For
And
Two
They
Won't
Find
What
They're
Looking
For
In
Either
Case
They're
Blind
To
Everything
Else
Because
Of
Expectation
Expectation
Fills
The
Mind
It's
No
Longer
Open
And
Receptive
But
Say
Is
Tayandao's
Teaching
The
Same
Or
Different
Than
Long
Tons
Making
Of
Rice
Cakes
Before
He
Was
Ordained
I
Mean
After
All
What
Tayandao
Was
Showing
Him
Was
I
Bow
When
You
Greet
Me
I
Thank
You
I
Receive
The
Tea
When
You
Give
It
To
Me
You
Know
I
Chop
Wood
And
Carry
Water
Everyday
Affairs
Well
He
Was
Doing
Everyday
Affairs
Before
He
Was
Ordained
The
Question
Is
Was
The
Teaching
That
He
Received
The
Same
Or
Different
Than
What
He
Was
Doing
Before
He
Was
Ordained
That
That's
A
Place
Where
There's
A
Lot
Of
Confusion
That's
The
Place
That
I
Hear
Echoing
In
My
Nightmares
Everything
I
Do
Is
Zen
And
I
Mumble
To
Myself
That
Wasn't
One
Of
My
Students
That
Said
That
That
Was
Somebody
Else's
Students
That's
Another
Lineage
If
You
Say
It's
The
Same
You
Haven't
Yet
Seen
What
Long
Ton
Realized
And
Yet
If
You
Say
It's
Different
You
Don't
Understand
Tayando's
Teaching
So
Since
It
Can't
Be
Found
In
Either
Of
These
Two
Places
In
The
End
Where
Will
You
Find
It
Where
Will
You
Even
Begin
To
Look
There's
The
Key
Here
To
The
Con
Is
There
A
Difference
Now
Everybody
Works
So
What's
Layman
Pong
Shooting
His
Mouth
Off
About
Chopping
Wood
And
Carrying
Water
We
All
Work
That
That
That
Were
The
Case
Every
Lumberjack
In
The
Pacific
Northwest
Would
Be
Enlightened
That's
All
They
Do
Is
Chop
Wood
And
Carry
Water
So
What's
The
Difference
What's
Going
On
What's
The
Key
What
Was
It
That
He
Realized
What
Was
It
That
Created
No
Gaps
And
The
Whole
Point
Of
Our
Practice
And
Training
Is
The
No
Gaps
I
Mentioned
The
Other
Day
When
I
Was
Talking
About
Shiho
That
Myotai
Had
Received
That
Part
Of
The
Ceremony
Mirrors
The
Teacher
Student
Relationship
As
It's
Developed
And
Matured
To
The
Point
Of
Shiho
Or
Dharma
Transmission
And
In
It
There's
A
Series
Of
Bows
That
The
Teacher
And
Student
Do
With
Their
Zagus
Bowing
Clothes
Overlapping
The
Other
As
They
Exchange
Positions
Teacher
Becomes
The
Student
Student
Becomes
The
Teacher
Parent
Becomes
The
Child
The
Child
Becomes
The
Parent
Teacher
Sends
The
High
Seat
The
One
That
Normally
Sits
Here
In
The
Zendo
The
Student
Circunambulates
And
Prostrates
To
The
Teacher
Teacher
Steps
Down
The
Student
Climbs
Onto
The
High
Seat
Teacher
Circunambulates
And
Prostrates
To
The
Student
Merging
Merging
Of
Differences
One of
The
Things
That's
Happening
In
These
Transmission
Ceremonies
This
Week
We're
Doing
Denkai
Or
Priestly
Transmission
For
Shugen
And
It's
The
First
Time
In
Our
Branch
Of
The
Lineage
That
This
Has
Happened
It's
Been
Almost
17
Years
In
Coming
My
Teacher
Used
To
Say
To
Me
And
I
Don't
When
Are
You
Going
To
Transmit
You've
Been
Teaching
For
15
Years
You've
Got
These
Students
That
You've
Had
For
14
15
Years
When
Are
You
Going
To
Transmit
It
Was
Like
I
Guess
They
All
Thought
I
Had
Retarded
Students
Or
Something
But
I
Really
Want
To
Make
It
Right
And
It's
Not
Over
Until
It's
Over
I
Was
My
Teacher's
Student
Until
The
Day
He
Died
And
In
Fact
I'm
Still
My
Teacher's
Student
He's
Always
Getting
In
My
Way
And
That
Says
It
Should
Be
And
I
Expect
To
Haunt
All
Of
You
In
The
Future
I
Look
Forward
To
It
So
So the
Priestly
Transmission
Denkai
Is
A
Transmission
That
Will
Be
Happening
Here
In
The
Case
Of
Myotai
And
Shugen
It
Goes
On
To
To
Shiho
Complete
Transmission
Of
The
Dharma
But
In
Some
Cases
Denkai
Will
Be
The
Final
Transmission
And
This
Is
For
People
Whose
Major
Occupation
Is
Going
To
Be
Priestly
Functions
Teaching
The
Dharma
In
That
Way
Perhaps
As
A
Prison
Chaplain
Or
A
Chaplain
In
A
Hospice
Or
Abbot
Of
A
Temple
That
Serves
A
Community
Practitioners
That's
Very
Different
Than
Training
A
Training
Monastery
And
The
Rigors
Of
A
Training
Monastery
Then
There
Are
People
Who
Will
Be
Receiving
The
Shiho
Which
Is
Both
The
Denkai
Which
Is
Denkai
Is
Transmission
Of
The
Precepts
And
The
Tantric
Teachings
And
Dembo
Which
Is
The
Empowerment
As
A
Teacher
And
Also
Dembo
Without
The
Priestly
Aspects
Of
It
Will
Be
Transmitted
To
Lay
Practitioners
Who
Realize
Themselves
Who
Reach
The
Point
Of
No
Gaps
All
Of
The
Other
Stuff
Is
Upaya
Devices
Devices
For
Getting
Us
To
The
Point
Of
No
Gaps
What
Is
No
Gaps
Complete
Merging
Of
Differences
The
Capping
Verse
Within
Darkness
There
Is
Light
But
Do
Not
Look
For
That
Light
Within
Light
There
Is
Darkness
But
Do
Not
Try
To
Understand
That
Darkness
That
That's
The
Line
From
Sikitos
Or
Shitao's
Identity
Are
Relative
And
Absolute
It's
Like
The
Foot
Before
And
The
Foot
Behind
And
Walking
Light
And
Darkness
Are
A
Pair
Form
And
Emptiness
Are
A
Pair
Heaven
And
Earth
Good
And
Bad
Up
And
Down
Self
And
Other
Mutually
Arising
Interpenetrated
Codependent
With
A
Mutual
Causality
What
Happens
To
The
One
Happens
To
The
Other
That's
How
We
Can
Say
This
Body
Body
And
Mind
Is
The
Body
And
Mind
Of
The
Universe
That's
How
Buddha
Could
Say
Between
Heaven
And
Earth
I
Alone
Am
The
Honored
One
To
Realize
That
Truth
Not
To
To
Understand
It
Not
To
Believe
It
But
To
Realize
It
Is
Transformative
It's
Truly
Transformative
It
Changes
Your
Way
Of
Perceiving
Yourself
And
The
Universe
There's
No
Way
Once
Having
Seen
It
Clearly
Once
Having
Realized
Clearly
No
Gaps
There's
No
Way
That
You
Can
Live
Your
Life
In
The
Old
Way
That
Was
The
Gift
That
Ryutan
Received
In
Studying
With
Tayandao
It
Was
The
Very
Same
Thing
That
He
Passed
On
To
Deshan
Who
Passed
It
On
To
Zhe
Fang
To
Unman
To
Fai
Yang
Down
Through
Successive
Generations
Through
China
Japan
Korea
Vietnam
And
Finally
It's
Found
Its
Place
On
This
Mountain
It's
The
Same
Dharma
That
Shakyamuni
Realized
And
Transmitted
To
Makai
Shapa
It's
The
Same
Wisdom
And
Compassion
That
Happened
From
Generation
To
Generation
Where
Did
It
Come
From
It
Didn't
Come
From
The
Buddha
It
Didn't
Come
From
The
Past
Seven
Buddhas
Nothing
Went
From
A
To
B
I
Can
Truthfully
Say I
Didn't
Get a
Single
Thing
From
My
Teacher
And
Every
Time
I
Thanked
Him
For
Giving
Me
So
Much
You
Would
Get
Embarrassed
It
Comes
Right
Out
Of
Our
Own
Life
We're
Born
With
It
And
We'll
Die
With
It
Whether
We
Realize
It
Or
Not
It's
There
And
What
We're
Engaged
In
This
Week
Could
Practice
Together
Is
A
Process
For
Uncovering
It
For
Going
Deep
Within
Ourselves
Beyond
The
Conditioning
Of
Parents
Nation
Culture
Education
To
The
Ground
Of
Being
That's
The
Life
Of
Each
One
Of
Us
And
Realizing
That
Ground
Of
Being
And
Realizing
That
Ground
Of
Being
Is
One
Thing
The
Next
Thing
Is
It
Must
Be
Actualized
It
Must
Manifest
In
The
World
In
Our
Activities
In
Our
Bowing
In
Our
Making
Of
Rice
Cakes
Or
Serving
Tea
It
Is
That
Realization
That
Informs
The
Activity
It's
That
Realization
That
Informs
The
Precepts
Then
We've
Given
Life
To
The
Great
Heart
Of
Compassion
And
The
Sword
Of
Manjushri
Of
Wisdom
That
Can
Kill
Or
Can
Give
Life
And
Although
There
Have
Been
Thousands
And
Thousands
Of
Commentaries
And
Scriptures
And
Koans
Written
On
This
It's
Still
No matter
How you
Turn
It
Comes
Down
To
You
You're
The
Only
One
That
Can
Do
It
Don't
You
