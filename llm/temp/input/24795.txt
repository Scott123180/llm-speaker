CHOIR SINGS
A monk asked Master Bodhidharma,
if someone is determined to reach enlightenment,
what is the most essential method they can practice?
Bodhidharma said the most essential method,
which includes all other methods,
is beholding the mind.
It seemed only fitting this being the Bodhidharma session
to speak a bit about mind,
because all throughout the teachings of Bodhidharma
and the koans that include Bodhidharma,
the question of mind comes up again and again.
So he says the most essential,
that is, if all other practices were to be cut away,
what is the one that could not.
And he says, beholding the mind.
Now really, session is this beholding the mind.
Session is usually translated as collecting the mind,
or gathering the mind,
beholding the mind.
All of it.
Wake up.
Don't look around.
Be still.
Beholding the mind.
Concentrate on your practice.
Don't let your mind wander.
Practice the edge.
Be intimate.
Beholding the mind.
Acknowledge the thought.
Let it go.
Return to your breath.
Return to the core.
Let body and mind drop away.
Behold the mind.
It's the essential practice.
Bodhidharma says,
the mind is the root from which all things grow.
If you can understand this,
that is, this mind,
everything else is included.
It's like the root of a tree.
All the trees, fruit and flowers,
branches and leaves,
depend on its root.
If you nourish its root,
a tree multiplies.
If you cut its root,
it dies.
Those who understand the mind
reach enlightenment.
With minimal effort.
Those who don't understand
the mind practice in vain.
Everything good and bad
comes from your own mind.
To find something beyond this
is impossible.
So this mind is the root from which
all things grow.
And he says,
if we can understand it,
if we can understand this mind,
we can understand everything.
Because it's the source,
it's the seed
of it all.
When we understand this,
then really,
Zazen,
the practice of Zazen,
it's obvious.
Naked and clean.
everything cut away
so that we're
unavoidably
meeting this mind.
But where is it
when we sit
and turn inward?
What Bodhidharma is saying is
everything that we see
comes from this mind.
But where is the mind?
Where does it dwell?
Seems like it would be
kind of an important question
if we're to be
beholding the mind.
Wouldn't we need
to find it first?
When Bodhidharma's
principal successor,
Ika,
came to him
asking
to study with him,
asking for Bodhidharma
to be his teacher.
Bodhidharma said,
why are you here?
What are you doing?
What's your problem?
And Nika said,
my mind isn't at peace.
My mind is confused.
My mind causes me pain.
And I can't
fix it.
And Bodhidharma said,
okay,
bring it to me.
Bring me your mind
and I'll set it at peace for you.
And so Ika
looked for this mind.
He was almost home.
All he had to do
was find it
and bring it to Bodhidharma.
And Bodhidharma said
he would set it to rest.
And he looked
and he looked
and he looked.
He searched
for his mind
just like
each person
who works with this
koan
has to search
for their mind.
So that it can be
set to rest.
When Ika
searched,
he finally
came back
to Bodhidharma
and said,
I can't find it.
And Bodhidharma
said,
there,
now,
finally,
it's at peace.
The Diamond Sutra
says the past mind,
present mind,
future mind,
all minds,
however many
we have,
can't be grasped.
So how are we
to behold
this mind
that seems
so elusive?
In fact,
what is beholding
the mind,
Bodhidharma says,
is the one
essential practice.
He also says
that the essence,
Bodhidharma also says,
that the essence
of the way
is non-attachment.
And that the goal
of those of us
who practice
is to be free
from appearances.
Actually,
in the text,
it says
that the essence
of the way
is detachment.
It's kind of
a slippery word.
If you look it up
in the dictionary,
detachment means
unconcerned
or aloof
or indifferent.
And that's not
what Bodhidharma
is saying.
Maybe non-attachment
is a little cleaner.
The essence
of the way
is non-attachment
and the goal
of those who practice
is freedom
from appearances.
because the mind
can't be found.
We practice
its appearances.
It's like tracking
an animal
in the woods.
Tracking an animal
is not running
after the body
of the animal itself.
but it's running
after its tracks.
All of its traces.
All of its leavings
in the woods.
Its marks,
its scratches,
its shit,
its hair.
And in doing that,
you become very intimate
with the nature
of the animal.
Its personality.
Its habits.
Its patterns.
Its conditioning.
Where it goes,
what it does,
its strengths,
its weaknesses.
So in a sense,
we're tracking
the mind
in Zazen.
Following
the traces.
Bodhidharma,
in this translation,
they're called
appearances.
What are they?
Well,
they're everything
that you've experienced
thus far
in this session.
They're everything
that we've experienced
thus far
in our life.
These appearances,
these tracks
are everything
that you're experiencing
right now.
Bodhidharma says
we have to be free
of this.
These appearances.
The trails of the mind.
The traces.
That's why
when we say
leave no traces,
it's like leaving
no tracks.
Leaving no remnants
of your own mind.
And that's why
when we become
attached
to leaving
no traces,
we've left
a trace
of that mind.
So these appearances
that we're
trying to be
free of,
it's everything.
it's good
zazen,
it's bad
zazen.
It's I'm better
than you,
it's you're
better than me.
It's you're fast
and I'm slow.
It's I'm tired.
It's my leg
hurts.
It's I can't do this.
It's I can do this.
It's I have done this.
It's not caring.
It's caring.
It's all of it.
And in following
these tracks,
what we do
is we learn
about the animal.
We learn about
the nature
and the habits
and the patterns
of this creature.
that's why
it's so essential
to be meticulous
because
it's just like
tracking an animal.
If you don't pay
attention,
you lose the track.
If we don't pay
attention in our
practice,
we lose
the trail.
We lose
the pattern.
But how do we
free ourselves
of these appearances?
If everything
that we see
is an appearance,
a shadow,
and if seeing
itself
is a shadow
or an appearance,
then what's real?
What's true?
What can we trust?
To be free
of the appearances
of the mind,
the trails,
the tracks of the mind
is to see them
as they really are.
The problem is
that we usually
see them
via
appearances,
just like I said.
It's like we're
our own
con artists,
flimflam artists.
It moves so fast,
we get suckered.
We get sucked in.
As I was thinking
about this,
I was remembering
when I was working
and living in Texas
years ago,
I was working
in a record store,
and a guy came in
one day when I was
all alone
and asked me
if he could change
a 50,
if I could change
a 50.
I said,
sure.
So I gave him,
I don't know,
two 20s and a 10.
He says,
oh no,
instead of the 20,
let me have two 10s
and two 5s.
And so I said,
okay.
And he goes,
oh wait a minute,
actually I need a 10
and five 1s.
And this went back
and forth really fast.
And then suddenly
I realized
I was going to end up
with no money.
And that's kind of
the way the mind works.
Finally I said,
stop.
Go.
And that's what
we have to do.
We have to say,
stop.
It happens so fast.
Shadow upon shadow
upon shadow.
You know,
it's kind of amazing
when you think about it.
If your mind
is wandering right now,
then at some point
in the future
you'll remember
this moment.
But you'll remember it
as though you were here.
But you weren't.
And that's what
our life is built on.
Those memories.
Those experiences.
Like a house of cards.
Of course,
the problem is
we believe in it.
We believe in that
shadow of shadow
of shadow.
It's real.
Bodhidharma says,
the appearance
of appearance
as no appearance
can't be seen
visually.
But can only be known
by means of wisdom.
That is,
to see through
to the truth of it.
You can't see it
with your eyes.
You can't see it
with your mind.
Has to be seen
with wisdom.
This is beholding
the mind.
To see it
as it really is.
Otherwise,
all we've got
is that house of cards.
We got a letter
recently from a student
who had written
about an experience
that he'd had here
at a previous session
with regards
to a service physician.
He said,
it was a first
for me.
Butterflies,
sweat,
nervousness
were at a peak.
My throat
was as tight
as could be.
I was scared.
My ego
was under attack
and I didn't
even know it.
Then he goes on
to say,
I manage
a large company
and I'm responsible
for a large
number of people.
Being in control
is important.
But when being
in control
becomes a way
of life,
I'm no longer
in control.
Instead,
I'm controlled
by my own
conditioning.
Kind of nice.
The problem
is we're afraid
of losing control.
We're afraid
of that house
of cards
come tumbling
down.
But of course,
that's what
needs to happen.
The reason
it's a problem
is because
we have an appearance
of what that
will be like.
We can see it.
We can feel it.
It's not that way.
The Bodhidharma
says,
this can only
be done
by means
of wisdom.
He says,
if you're
looking for
the way,
it won't
appear until
your body
disappears.
It's like
stripping bark
from a tree.
This karmic
body undergoes
constant change.
It has no
fixed reality.
Practice
according to
your thoughts.
Don't hate
life and death.
Don't love
life and death.
Keep your
every thought
free of
delusion,
free of
appearances.
And in
life,
you'll
witness the
beginning of
nirvana.
And in
death,
you'll
experience the
assurance of
no rebirth.
If you're
looking for
the way,
it won't
appear until
your body
disappears.
Like
stripping bark
from the
tree.
Dogen
said,
to study
the way
is to
study
the
self.
To study
the way
is to
study
the mind.
To study
the self
is to
forget
the self.
To study
mind
is to
forget
mind.
You
can't
use
mind
to
study
mind.
The
only way
to see
it is
with
wisdom.
Practice
according to
your thoughts.
What else
will you
practice
according to?
practice
according to
your
appearances,
according to
your
shadows.
If
everything
that we
ever have
experienced,
are
experiencing,
and will
experience,
is this,
then what
else could
we practice
according to?
They're the
tracks.
that's
why it's
because of
delusion
that we
can realize
ourselves.
Don't
hate life
and death.
Don't
love life
and death.
Don't
hate your
thoughts.
Don't
love your
thoughts.
Don't
hate your
anger.
Don't
love it.
don't
hate love.
Don't
love it.
Don't
hate hate.
Don't
love it.
Does that
mean being
aloof?
Being
unconcerned?
love it.
Don't
love it.
It just
means don't
hate,
don't
love.
It means
don't be
attached.
This
beholding
mind is
the essential
method.
Really,
all it is
is simply
not looking
outside of
ourselves.
that's
what every
master,
every
teacher
has
taught,
beginning
with
Shakyamuni.
All
sentient
beings and
I together
attain the
way.
Don't
put a
head on
top of
the one
you already
have.
Don't
look around.
Don't
move.
That's
what it's
all about.
Don't
look outside.
And it's
amazing how
hard it is
not to do
that.
Why is
that?
Why do
we develop
such an
incredibly
strong,
deep
reflex
to
immediately
look outside?
Why is
it necessary
to strip
the building
of reading
material and
so on?
Practice
silence.
Don't
look at
each
other.
and even
then.
How many
times today
have you
looked
outside?
Why does
it come so
readily?
Why is it
our first
impulse?
I can
imagine it
being a
backup.
But why
is it
the first
thing we
do?
It doesn't
make sense.
you know,
you think
about the
difficulties
that we
each have
and how
we've
tried to
solve them.
Maybe we
continually
look outside
because we
think,
well,
I haven't
been able
to figure
it out
yet.
I haven't
been able
to solve
this yet,
so somebody
else
maybe
can help.
But have
we ever
really
looked
inside?
Do we
even know
what that
means?
How do
you do
it?
Bodhidharma
said the
only way
to see
these
trails,
these
tracks of
the self
of the
mind is
with
wisdom.
that
means
being
able
to
really
see.
And
again,
can't use
your eyes,
can't use
mine.
He says
somebody who
seeks the
way doesn't
look beyond
themselves,
because they
know that
the mind
is the
way.
But when
they find
the mind,
they find
nothing.
And when
they find
the way,
they find
nothing.
If you
think you
can use
your mind
to find
the way,
you're
deluded.
And in
your delusion,
Buddhahood
exists.
When
you're
aware,
that is
awake.
It doesn't
exist.
No
Buddhahood.
And he
said the
reason for
this is
because
awareness,
being awake,
is
Buddhahood,
is
wisdom.
The eye
can't see
itself.
Someone who
seeks the
way doesn't
look beyond
themselves.
Again,
every single
teacher has
said this
over and
over and
over.
God,
as she
says,
trust
yourself.
That's all
he's saying.
Don't look
outside.
The only
shadows,
the only
trails
that are
going to
help me
track
this
are my
trails.
my
tracks,
my
appearances,
my
shadows,
my
delusion.
I
can't
use
yours.
You
can't
use
mine.
Don't
look
outside
yourself.
That's
why,
you know,
the whole
thing we
get into
with
comparing.
you're
faster than
I am.
You're
moving
further
along.
I'm
faster than
you are.
I'm
further
ahead.
You're
further
behind.
Kind of
crazy.
What's it
built on?
The
shadow.
Do I
know your
mind?
Do you
know my
mind?
what's it
based on?
Who am I
competing
with?
What is
there to
compete
against?
What's
the
reward?
When you
find the
mind,
you find
nothing.
Finding
nothing is
finding
mind.
finding
nothing is
finding the
way,
is finding
yourself.
It's because
of that that
it always
seems so
crazy to
me when
the way
that some
groups or
teachers have
tried to
deal with
this competitive
nature of
ours is by
getting rid
of all the
tools of
competition.
You know,
the robes
and the
titles and
students and
non-students and
all this and
that.
I mean,
you think you
can eradicate
it that way?
The only
way is
with wisdom.
Robe has
nothing to do
with it.
Stages have
nothing to do
with it.
It's our own
mind.
Dawey said,
don't grasp
another's bow.
Don't ride
another person's
horse.
don't meddle
in another
person's
affairs.
Another
person's
practice.
Don't try
to practice
somebody else's
practice.
Don't try
and live
someone else's
mind.
Though this
is a common
saying,
it can also
be sustenance
for entering
the path.
Just examine
yourself.
From morning
to night,
what do you
do to help
others and
to help
yourself?
If you
notice even
the slightest
partiality or
insensitivity,
wake up.
Don't be
careless.
don't be
partial or
insensitive.
Don't get
attached to
love or
hate.
Don't make
a nest in
stillness or
in action.
Don't make
a nest.
Don't stop.
Just examine
yourself
and see
what's
right.
Free yourself
of your
own
trials,
your own
appearances.
See them
first.
Kezan Zenji
said,
so it's not
necessary to
ask about
others.
Just look
back on
your own
very first
determination
of mind.
Look into
yourself and
see what's
right and
what's not
right.
this is
why it
said that
it is
hard to
be as
careful of
the end
as of
the beginning.
If they
would really
be as
beginners,
who would
not become
people of
the way?
this is
very important.
This is
why it
said that
it is
hard to
be as
careful of
the end
as of
the beginning.
Master
Shen Yen
said once
you have
a little
insight,
double your
effort.
Be twice
as diligent.
Be scrupulous.
Why?
Why with a
little clarity
can't we
relax a little?
It's harder
to be careful
in the end
than it is
in the
beginning.
In the
beginning,
we're a
student.
We're a
beginner.
We don't
know.
We know
we don't
know.
In the
end,
we're still
a beginner.
And the
end happens
again and
again and
again.
The end
happens every
time we
stop being
a beginner.
And it's
an end
because it
stops.
The process
stops.
Practice
stops.
It's all
sealed up
tight.
in
knowing.
It's like
practicing a
koan.
How do
you sit
with a
koan when
you think
you've
seen it?
Just sit
there and
put it in
a box.
Nail it
shut.
and then
sit there
reaffirming
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
I'm
right.
How do
you be a
beginner?
There.
But it
takes so
long.
Doesn't
it?
Isn't
that what
everybody
says?
Isn't
that what
everybody
thinks?
Too
long.
you know
I heard
on the
radio
I thought
it was a
gag actually.
It was an
advertisement
for what
was called
the learning
machine.
And
it's
somehow
a CD
and it's
some
contraption
that you
fit on
your head
and you
see films
and stuff.
And the
basic sales
pitch you
can learn
without any
effort
whatsoever.
clean,
fast,
easy,
simple,
and fast.
That's
the way
we want
it.
Too
bad.
That's
not the
way it
is.
Rather,
too
bad if
that's
the way
it
worked.
How
long
does
it
take?
An
old
Chinese
master
said,
as he
was
closing
out
a
period
of
training
just
like
we're
doing
closing
this
winter
training
period
in the
next
few
weeks.
He
said,
oh,
virtuous
ones,
in this
90-day
period
of this
winter
retreat,
have you
experienced
awakening
or not?
if you're
genuine
people of
the
path,
then you
take all
the time
spans of
all the
worlds
in the
universe
as your
time limit
for perfect
enlightenment.
It doesn't
matter if you
have to
practice for a
long period
or for a
short period,
for a hundred
days or for
a thousand
days,
whether you're
just starting
or whether
you're just
ending a
retreat.
you just
start by
focusing your
attention on
your practice.
If you
don't awaken
in one
year,
you study
for another
year.
If you
don't awaken
in ten
years,
you study
for another
ten years.
If you
don't awaken
in twenty
years,
you study
for another
twenty.
If you
go through
your whole
life without
awakening,
you certainly
do not alter
your purpose.
you must
see the
truth.
Only then
can you
find peace.
Can you
do that?
Can we
be patient
and not
wait?
can we
begin again
and again
and again
and again
and again?
Can it
really not
matter
if it's
fast or
slow?
Quick or
long?
the idea
can be
formidable
but recognize
it's an
idea.
It's an
appearance.
It's another
shadow.
It's
accomplished
in a
moment.
Once
and
again
and again
and again.
It's
very
simple.
You've
already
proved
it's
possible.
It's
possible.
again.
It's
what this
is
about.
Proving
it's
possible
again
and
again.
Without
end.
finish
end.
Take care.
Let's
go.
Put
me
quick.
