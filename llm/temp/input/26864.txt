the book of equanimity case for world-honored one points to the ground
preface to the assembly as soon as a single moat of dust arises the whole earth is contained
therein with a single horse in a single lands the land is extended who is this person that
can be master in any place and meet the source in everything the main case as the world-honored
one was walking with the congregation he pointed to the ground with his finger and said this spot
is good to build the sanctuary Indra Emperor of the gods took a blade of grass stuck it in the
ground and said the sanctuary is built the world-honored one smiled the verse the boundless
spring on the hundred plants picking up what comes to hand he uses it knowingly the 16-foot
tall golden body a collection of virtuous qualities casually leads him by the hand into the red dust
able to master in the dusts from outside creation the guest shows up everywhere life is sufficient
in its way no matter if one is not clever as clever as others this corn kind of found me I
I'm not quite sure where I'm going to go with it yet although I have some sense of it and the first
thing I wanted to point to and say something about is in the preface to the assembly well there are three
sentences in there soon soon as a single moat of dust arises the whole earth is contained therein and that
we've heard before that even in a speck of dust the ten thousand things reside complete and that's of
course the diamond net of Indra the total interpenetration of all things from the most
gigantic to the tiniest completely coexisting interpenetrated mutual causality you affect one and you
affect the totality of the universe then the second line with a single horse and a single lance the
lands extended a lot of these phrases come up in these Chinese collections China was a land that there was
just continual battles and I think the three or four classes of people were the merchants the generals
the scholars and the monks and then of course the Emperor and so a lot of what people read a lot of what
they heard a lot of what they talked about was about war in generals and I think it's about time we put an end to that shit and not translate it
into English into English as our example these are just examples of single actions and the results of it I'd prefer for example because of a single wire the whole city is in darkness and I think that has a multiplicity of ways of seeing it a single seed and the plum trees fragrance fills the ten erections
who is this person who is this person who can master who can be master in any place and meet the source in everything who indeed as the world honored one was walking with this congregation he pointed to the ground with his finger and said this spot is good to build a monastery in an Indra emperor of the gods took a blade of grass stuck it in the
ground and said the monastery in the ground and said the monastery is built the world on it once smiled
and some of you are familiar with the use of the blade of grass in several different places in the sutras Buddha once asked Manjushri to please find him something that was not medicine in the whole universe
Manjushri said he couldn't find anything that wasn't medicine everything was medicine
so Buddha says then bring me something that is medicine and Manjushri brought a blade picked up a blade of grass and handed it to him the Buddha held up that blade of grass and said this is the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha
the Buddha manifested in a pile of shit and rubbish
Dogen asks the chief cook of his monastery to be able to manifest the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha with a cabbage leaf
the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha
is the physical body of the Buddha manifested in the phenomenal world in other words the teachings of wisdom and compassion in this life in this world of phenomena among the ten thousand things amid the pain and the grief the suffering the war and the peace the joy the peacefulness
some of you may remember the living room discussion of the Pong family
they were all sitting around the living room and those of you that don't know the Pongs the Pongs lived during the Tang dynasty
layman Pong studied with Master Basso and succeeded him although he never became a monk remained a layman
his wife was also enlightened and had studied with Passo and several of the other masters
and their daughter is said to be the clearest of the three of them they also had a son but he wasn't into Buddhism so there's not much is known about him but the three of them were sitting around the living room one day having you know everyday conversation that families have
and Laman Pong got up off the couch and said difficult difficult difficult like finding a needle in a pile of millet seed and his wife got up from her chair and said easy easy easy easy
like the feet touching the ground when getting up from bed and the daughter said neither difficult nor easy the ancestors meaning on the tips of a hundred thousand grasses of course the layman showed one side the mother showed the other side and the daughter showed the total merging of both
that was neither this week this past this month and the month that's coming there are several things that have been going on one is that have all kind of been running through my head as I was working with this the diamond net of Indra classes that we did a couple weekends ago the eight gates workshop that was
that was I think a week ago I lost track of what was when teachings of the insentient that are going to be happening this coming weekend the white plum meeting that's going to happen in Japan well I'm gone for a couple of weeks there are a lot of things that are happening there that it's so karmically related to to this sangha and to what's going on here in the country the white plum of course is the original white plum and
school in the white plum of course is Milyansian
L.A. And out of that lineage came. We're now in the, so Roshi was the first
generation, second generation, third generation. There's third generation
already from that in the past 25 years that happened. Also I'm going to be
visiting Sedo, Sedo Sa's temple, and the purpose of the visit is to dedicate his
temple. It's very old, maybe 500 years old. It's been there for a long time, but it's
never had a zendo in 500 years. People don't do zazen, didn't do zazen there.
And Sedo's visit to this country, like Dosho's visit to this country before him,
Dosho spent two years here practicing with us, and Sedo spent two years
practicing with us, and both of them were incredible teachers for this sangha.
Both of them were totally, incredibly nourished by this sangha, and in turn
nourished them. I mean we talk about examples of ultimate in work practice,
both of them were extraordinary, and in their zazen they were extraordinary, and
just their being they were extraordinary. But they both learned something very
powerful. They learned about lay practitioners. They never knew about lay
practitioners in Japan. Lay practitioners don't sit. Monks don't sit. They went back
to their respective temples, and each of them built a Western style zendo. Not
even, not even their kind of zendo, but a Western style zendo, which altar at one end
of the room, and sitting on the floor with rows of things. Usually they have raised tans
with the altar in the center. Cowboys then they brought back. And he's, he's having an
opening. He's got priests from all over Japan coming, and his intent is to reach
out the lay practitioners in Japan and encourage them to come and practice there.
We'll be doing an exchange program where students go there, and those students come
here also. So that's pretty significant. That's the result of the karma of of this
place, of this mountain, of this sangha, the people here. So Bayan Hakujin sent it out.
It rattled around, and now it's gone back, and it's going to spread there just as it's
spreading here. So it's a very auspicious kind of thing. And of course we're also
going to visit the head temples, Dogen's temple of Ehiji, and Kezan Sojiji, and Soen Roshi's grave,
who was my first teacher, and a real reconnection with a lot of the karmic links, and an opportunity
to appreciate what those teachers did. I mean, you know, there's no big bucks in it, doing it this way,
in this country, coming here. I mean, Mizumi Roshi's brothers are very, very wealthy. He's a pauper,
pauper, by comparison. He could be doing what they're doing, but he chose to bring the Dharma
to America, and to stay here, and to teach here, and to die here. He's an American citizen now.
So that's important. It's coming up. Born as the Earth series that's happening. The video that we're
doing on World Peace and Harmony, the art project, Spine of the Goddess, also kept coming up as I looked at
all these things, and this sanctuary that's being built here by Indra, with the blade of grass.
What was he pointing to? What is the sanctuary?
And at one of the first-generation teachers' meetings, one of the teachers there
was telling the group how he used this koan to teach ecology, and I said to him,
this koan has nothing to do with ecology.
He said, well, I used it. Of course, he had never done koan studies, so you're free to do it then.
There's nothing that will stop you. If you had done koan studies and you understood what the koan is about,
well, you could, there is, of course, teaching in ecology here. There's a teaching in ecology in any of the koans.
There's teaching in ecology in Mu, believe it or not.
But that's not the point of the koan. There's another point that's going on, that's very important.
So what is the, what is the sanctuary? Is it the earth itself?
We talk a lot about the teachings of the Incentiants. We'll be talking about it next weekend.
The teachings of the Incentiants, it's not about Bambi or Dumbo or Woody Woodpecker or Smokey the Bear.
You know, it's about intimacy.
It's about a sense of unity, not only with the great earth, and that's the way we kind of slant it.
You know, we think, oh, it's organic. It's good, organic.
You know, potassium cyanide's organic.
You know, you find it in the earth, you know.
Sulfur dioxide comes out of volcanoes.
You know, hydrogen sulfide comes out of farts.
It's all organic.
But still it's toxic.
And it doesn't make it wonderful because it's organic or not wonderful because it's not organic.
And the teachings of the Incentiants includes the whole catastrophe.
Not only the mountains and the rivers.
Not only the sounds of the valley streams and the fragrance of the plum blossoms.
But the stink of the sewage and the Brooklyn Bridge, the Twin Towers, the Dodge Dusters parked outside.
Which, incidentally, is, smells of gasoline.
Either there's a leak or something.
If somebody should look at it, it might be dangerous.
It's a very strong smell of gasoline every time I go by.
In any case, our tendency is to kind of be very one-sided about what these teachings are.
Dogen tells wonderful stories in his Sounds of the Valley Streams about different enlightenment experiences.
Many of them you've probably heard.
Most important one was Sotoba, who studied under Master Josu.
Sotoba was a layman.
And he studied under Josu.
Josu gave him the koan concerning the inanimate things proclaiming the Dharma.
The very same koan that Master Tozan had.
Master Tozan's enlightenment was about teachings of the insentient or the inanimate.
And he worked on the koan and just didn't have enough insight at first to see it.
And then one night, while listening to the Sound of the Valley Stream,
Dogen says,
The valley stream seemed to echo through the mountains with such a force as to reach the heavens.
He became enlightened.
And he wrote the poem,
The sound of the valley stream is his great tongue.
The colors of the mountain are his pure body.
In the night, I have heard the 84,000 hymns.
But how do I tell it to the people the next day?
Master Josu tested him the next day and approved his realization.
Similar thing happened to Master Kyogen.
Kyogen was an incredible practitioner.
Very dedicated.
Studied with Master Dai.
And Dai would constantly ask him.
Of course, Kyogen was a scholarly Buddhist.
He understood all the sutras and everything.
He was also a monk.
So Dai would say,
You're an authority on the sutras.
Please explain the self that existed before your parents were born.
And without using interpretations or memorizing passages in the commentaries,
Kyogen was unable to give an answer.
And after a while,
Dai constantly asking,
What is your original face?
The face you had before your parents were born.
He, being unable to answer it,
Became very, very despondent
And ashamed.
Couldn't find any of the answers in the sutras or books.
And after a while,
He burned all of his books and said,
A painted rice cake cannot satisfy hunger.
I don't want enlightenment in this life anymore.
From now on,
I'll be nothing but a monk who works in a kitchen and serves rice.
And so he went to work in a kitchen.
And he spent many, many years working in a kitchen.
As an attendant,
Not even as a tenzo,
Just carrying trays and serving,
Cleaning up,
Serving the other monks.
He worked for a long time like this.
And one day he said to Dai,
I'm nothing but a simpleton.
I've spent years seeking the way and I can't find it.
Please give me a word that will lead me to the way.
And Dai,
Being a compassionate,
Grandmotherly sort,
Said,
I can give you a word.
But if I do,
You'll resent it later.
And several more years went by.
I mean,
This man spent a lot of years studying there.
So those of you that have been,
You know,
Working on a koan for six months or a year or two years
And get despondent,
You should take court.
And,
You know,
Seppo,
20 years before he saw it.
Ongan,
25 years with Yakujo.
Yakujo,
I mean,
You know,
One of the greatest masters that ever lived.
He didn't come to enlightenment.
And finally he did with his dharma brother,
Dogo.
So after a few more years,
He moved,
He left the monastery and says,
You know,
I'm no good for anything.
And he despondent,
Was walking down the road.
And he passed the cemetery where the national teacher,
Daisho was,
Nanyo Echu,
Was buried.
And he built himself a small hermitage.
And,
Decided he would stay there and tend to the grave.
That was his practice.
And,
There was no one else there.
And one day when he was sweeping the path,
He accidentally hit a pebble,
With a bamboo broom.
And the pebble,
Struck,
The bamboo that was growing there,
And made a,
Pink!
Sound.
And he had an incredible Kencho.
Experience.
Probably because he gave up.
You know,
Probably because he said,
I don't want to be enlightened anymore.
He no longer,
Had himself separated from the goal.
He just let go of it.
And then he,
Burned some,
Incense and,
Bowed in the direction of Dai.
And,
Remembering what he said.
You know,
I can give you a word.
But if I do,
You'll resent it later on.
And he said,
Your deep compassion is limitless.
And he was,
If he had answered my foolish question,
I never would have attained realization.
That's what he said.
And,
And,
Other examples,
That Dogen uses,
Master,
Ruyuin,
Who,
Was enlightened,
At the sight of peach blossoms.
You know,
Ten years in the forest,
Now I'm startled,
At the sight,
Of peach blossom.
Another monk asked,
Master Choza,
How can we possess mountains,
Rivers,
And the earth,
As our own.
Choza said,
How can we return to the mountains,
Rivers,
And the earth.
He was,
Obviously separated from it.
Another master,
The Kosho said,
How can our original nature,
Be mountains,
Rivers,
And the earth.
The master replied,
How do you,
What are you calling mountains,
Rivers,
And the earth.
Is there any difference,
Between our own,
Original nature,
And mountains,
Rivers,
And the earth.
Is there any difference,
Between our own,
Original pure,
Undefiled nature,
And the pure,
Original,
Undefiled nature,
Of the ten thousand things.
All of it.
Not just the good things,
The bad things as well.
The whole catastrophe,
Is included.
That's the thing we forget.
So that sanctuary,
That the Buddha,
Wanted built,
Includes the ten thousand dharmas.
Is the ten thousand dharmas.
Is this very body,
And mind itself.
In his verse,
It said,
The boundless spring,
On a hundred plants.
That's not much different,
Than what,
Uh,
Daughter Pong said,
On the tips of a thousand grasses.
The ancestors meaning.
The boundless spring,
We call it the endless spring.
The endless spring,
Of enlightenment.
The spring,
That has nothing to do,
With yin or yang,
This or that.
The spring,
That has nothing to do,
With the seasons.
It's on a hundred plants.
A hundred plants,
And a hundred grasses.
There's delusion itself.
On the tips,
Of the delusion,
Is enlightenment.
Within samsara itself,
Is nirvana.
And then he says,
Picking up what comes to hand,
He uses it knowingly.
And for me,
That's the key,
To why this dharma has,
Maintained its vitality,
In its life,
For two thousand five hundred years.
And if that continues,
Picking up what comes to hand,
And using it knowingly,
Then it'll continue,
For another two thousand five hundred years.
But if we get into picking,
And choosing,
What's the right dharma,
And the wrong dharma,
This,
Not that,
We miss it.
Using it knowingly.
I was reading,
Just the other day,
In a computer magazine,
Where one of the designers,
Of an arts program,
For computers,
Said,
If Leonardo da Vinci,
Had a computer,
He would have used it,
For his,
He would have used the art program.
And at first,
I had a reaction to it,
And then I thought about it.
Of course he would have.
Of course he would have.
I mean,
The guy was a scientist,
As well as an artist.
He was a creator.
He used everything.
He invented the airplane,
And the gears,
And communication,
And hundreds of things,
As well as painting,
Some great masterpieces.
If it was there,
He would have used it knowingly.
Uman picked up a shit stick,
And used it to expound the dharma.
He propped up the dharma gate,
For all of us,
With a shit stick.
So in Roshi,
He used toilet paper,
To expound the dharma.
Brought it right to the taisho with him.
And talked for 45 minutes,
About toilet paper.
Nansen used the peony.
Gutai a finger.
Basho a stick.
I have Ms. Mazzy.
And I have Ms. Amiga.
And don't take it lightly.
Ms. Amiga.
That cold lump of computer,
Has the great heart,
Of Kannon Bodhisattva.
If I tell you,
The mountains and rivers,
Has the great heart,
Of Kannon Bodhisattva,
You'll all,
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
But my computer,
Has the great heart,
Of Kannon Bodhisattva.
In just three months,
She has already nourished,
The hearts,
Of sentient beings,
Thousands of miles,
From this monastery.
Who have never seen this monastery,
And probably never will see this monastery.
Out of her guts,
Came that nourishment.
Her voice is the voice of the Buddha.
Her form is the form of Kannon Bodhisattva,
Manifesting in accord to potential.
She can't grow a potato,
But then the garden can't edit a video.
Each in their own way,
The potato,
And the computer,
Manifest the 16 foot golden body,
Of the Buddha,
In the midst of pain and confusion.
If we have eyes,
To see it.
That's what the teachings,
Of the insentient are.
It's not just the,
Gurgle of the valley stream.
It's the hum of the vacuum cleaner too.
Some wonderful things,
Can be possible,
When the insentient are used skillfully.
But our tendency is to use them greedily,
And unskillfully.
Our tendency is to let,
Money,
Dominate,
Moral and ethical values.
And that's what screws it up.
This assistant that was here with,
Alan Ginsberg,
Told me an incredible story.
Incredible story.
Graham Nash,
I don't know,
Many of you,
Youngins,
Know Graham Nash,
From Crosby,
Stills,
Nash & Young.
Well,
Graham Nash is an extraordinary human being.
He's not just a singer.
And if you've ever listened to him talk,
And if you've ever listened to the words of his music,
You see what an extraordinary being he is.
And recently he's had a TV show,
Where he's the host and he interviews people.
It's just incredible what he was putting on there.
And also the work that he did for his buddy,
One of the band members who was,
Really almost killed himself with drugs.
And how he was part of getting him rehabilitated,
And out of prison and so on.
He interviewed him on the program.
But anyway,
Graham grew up in England.
And his father was a photographer.
And the dark room was in his bedroom.
So from the time he was a little kid,
He watched his father develop pictures.
And he developed a real interest in photography.
So he became a collector.
Of course he made a lot of money as a musician.
And he invested it in photographs.
And finally he had thousands and thousands of photographs.
And his house was filled with it.
And his wife finally had it.
She didn't want them around the house anymore.
So he sold this collection for,
I don't know how much,
10, 15 million dollars or something.
It was an enormous collection.
He took the money.
You have to have,
Already had exhibits before they'll exhibit you.
Of course nobody wants to be the first one
To give you the exhibit.
So,
You know,
New photographers,
New artists have a hard time getting started.
And then he endowed a few college
For art education and so on.
But the biggest thing he did
Is he bought
This gigantic computer
That can digitize
Images
And this enormous
$40,000
I'm sorry
$250,000
Jet
Ink
Printer
Huge
That prints
Huge sheets
You know
Mural size
And he can produce
Images
Photographic images
As perfect
As a photographing emulsion
No silver
None of the toxins
None of the chemicals
Some of the most obnoxious chemicals
On the face of this earth
That are totally destructive
To the environment
Are in the process
Of photographic processing
And the silver compounds
That go into the emulsion
It's one of the
Great guilt trips
That I've had
At doing that
When I had my own
Photographic laboratory
I used to do this
Excessive
Neutralization
And chromatography
Absorption
Columns
So that I wouldn't be
Sending that stuff
Down into the sewers
And into the Hudson River
And down
Into the ocean
But still
There it is
I mean
It's still toxic
Some of it
Can be recovered
But
And it's very costly
And
But
It continues
And why does it continue
Guess
I mean
Eastman Kodak's enormous
And it's endowed
A college
A university
It would be very difficult
To do anything about it
But this
Machine
Will produce
Perfect photographic prints
With a full
Scale
Of tones
And it will do it in color
And it will do it in black and white
And color
Chemicals that are in color
Even worse
That's only half the story
One of the things
That this guy
Didn't mention to me
Is that the next
Obvious thing
Is a camera
That will make
The photograph
That doesn't have to go
On a piece of film
See what they're doing
Right now
Is they're taking the film
Making a print
Digitizing it
Putting it on a computer
And then making the prints
From that
So they're saving
All of the silvering chemicals
From the printing process
But it's still involved
In the original negative
But a camera can be made
It's just a computer
A little piece of a computer
That will make an image
That will not destroy
The environment
That will be imperfect
Of paper
Paper and carbon
Is what will be involved
In it
It's just an incredible
Possibility
Using it
Knowingly
Using it
In a self-centered way
Without any consideration
For the rest of the universe
Without any consideration
For a neighbor
That's in
Disharmony
With the universe
That's what creates
Pain and suffering
That's what creates
Wars
How to create harmony
And we do it
We do it
When we push somebody
On a bus
We do it
When we're impatient
And honk, honk, honk
The horn
When the traffic's
Not moving
We do it
When we're noisy
In a library
Where somebody else
Is trying to study
Yet we come to the monastery
And everybody bows
To each other
And we're very nice
To each other
And the minute
We walk out the gate
It starts in
You know
When we dig out
And hit that highway
Behind that 200 horsepower
And nobody get in our way
All of these devices
Can kill or give life
Just like that blade of grass
Can kill or give life
It depends on how we use it
It depends on how knowingly
We use it
And when you realize
That this great earth
And everything in it
Is nothing but yourself
And that what you do
To all of it
Every bit of it
You do to yourself
Then your way of dealing
With the 10,000 things
A way of dealing
With each other
Is completely transformed
Everything is the same
Nothing's going to get wonderful
Because you realize yourself
But what will happen
Is you will be able
To function in a way
That is at peace
In harmony
With the 10,000 things
And by doing that
You'll be in peace
And harmony with yourself
There's a lot to be said
For right livelihood
How you make your living
Makes a big difference
In how you feel about yourself
It's a tremendous change
That happens
When you feel
That what your actions
Are doing
Are nourishing somebody
Rather than
Poisoning somebody
Or hurting somebody
Picking up what comes to hand
He uses it knowingly
The 16 foot
Golden body of the Buddha
A collection of virtuous qualities
Casually leading
By the hand
Into the red dust
And the red dust
Is the pain and confusion
Red dust is the pollution
The red dust is war
The red dust is greed
Anger and ignorance
Able to master
Able to be master
In the dust
How do you master
The dust
That's the manifestation
Of the 10,000 hands
And arms
And eyes
Of Kannon Bodhisattva
That's the great heart
Of compassion
It's there
I mean if it's in
My computer
It must be in you
Right
But you got to realize it
I realize it
I see it's in you
But unless you realize it
You won't use it
You won't manifest it
You'll just manifest your life
Out of the program
Out of habit
Out of conditioning
Out of what you've been told
What you've been
What you heard
Rather than what you've experienced
Of your own being
In your own life
From outside creation
A guest shows up
From outside of creation
Beyond creation
Unborn
Everywhere
Life is sufficient
In its way
Somehow we always find it lacking
We always find ourselves lacking
And yet it's abundant
It's abundant
It's abundant
It's abundant in all sorts of things
It's abundant in evil
And it's abundant in good
And it's abundant in
That which is neither good nor evil
Moon in the dew drop
Formless form
In a single chip
Computer chip
Everywhere
Everywhere life
Life is sufficient
In its own way
Pain and joy
Notwithstanding
Everywhere
The marvelous
Mind of nirvana
Endlessly teaching
Do you hear it?
Do you see it?
Do you feel it?
If so
Then that's the place of entry
Right there
You enter the way
