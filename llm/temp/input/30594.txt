Case 29. Neither the wind nor the flag. Main case. The wind was flapping a temple flag. Two monks were arguing about it.
One said the flag was moving. The other said the wind was moving. Arguing back and forth, they could come to no agreement. The six patriarchs said, it is neither the wind nor the flag that is moving. It is your mind that is moving.
The two monks were struck with awe. Master Muman's commentary.
It is neither the wind nor the flag nor the mind that is moving. Where do you see the heart of the patriarch?
If you can see clearly, you will know that the two monks obtained gold, intending to buy iron.
Also, you will know that the patriarch could not repress his compassion and made an awkward scene.
That's the Muman's poem.
The wind moves. The flag moves. The mind moves. All of them miss it.
Though he knows how to open his mouth, he does not see he was caught by words.
Now, we've got one more full day of Sashin in front of us.
And this is the time that Sashin can be most powerful.
We're weak of Joriki.
A lot of the activity of our mind has fallen away.
And we're in a state of consciousness that's different than the way we normally are.
A week ago, a lot of barbs sticking out of everybody.
Crank, scratching at each other.
And by now, those have been worn down.
If I saw them, to little bumps.
In another week or two, they'll be back again.
Try to appreciate those of you that have been sitting all week where your head's at right now.
And know that it can be like that.
All the time.
The more you sit, the clearer you get.
The more the distance between Sashins.
It's not like between Sashins.
Somehow, they connect.
And you don't know whether you're doing Sashin or not doing Sashin each day.
You go about your work.
You're sitting.
With the same kind of Sashin head.
It's very easy to not appreciate your situation when you're in the midst of it.
Last night, we talked about the Sixth Patriarch.
When he was a 24-year-old selling firewood.
Heard the monk chanting the Diamond Sutra.
And went to Northern China to meet the Master from the monastery that the monk had come from.
And there in the Mondo with the Master, the Master realized this deep spirituality.
But because of the jealousy of the monks and because he was a layman and literate and from the South,
he let him work in the rice shack.
And then one day, when the Master was testing his disciples to find a successor,
Eno made a presentation that by far overshadowed the one made by the senior monk.
And as a result, the bowl and robe of Bodhidharma was transmitted to Eno.
He became the Sixth Patriarch.
And the first time it happened with a layman.
And the first and only time it happened with an illiterate and also someone so young.
The only other thing that could have made it even more perfect is if he were a she.
But that would have been next to impossible, Tang Dynasty, China, in the year 700.
So we have to wait for the 20th century in America
to have a first matriarch and saying,
who knows, he may be he.
Never can tell.
So after passing on the bowl and the robe of Bodhidharma,
Master knew that Eno's life was in danger.
And so he asked him, in the middle of the night, to leave.
He rode him across the river.
Eno went on his way,
immediately pursued by this monk, Mio, an ex-general.
And finally, when Mio caught up with him,
the mondo that ensued,
think neither good nor evil at that very moment.
What is the true nature of the monk Mio?
Mio was enlightened.
And the sixth patriarch went on
into hiding, as his master had told him,
to ripen, mature,
not to emerge and start teaching
until he had done that.
Now this coin picks it up
when Eno came back out of hiding 15 years later.
Now fully matured
as his end master.
He began wandering around the countryside.
In particular, he came to this monastery
He was still a layman
and he came to Hoshoji
in Koshu.
And he came to hear the venerable Inju,
the master there,
lecturing on the Nirvana Sutra.
One day, Eno happened to hear
the two monks arguing
and pointing at a flag
fluttering in the wind.
The one said that it was the flag moving
the other said it was the wind moving.
And when a flag is moving,
our eyes perceive it as actually moving.
But if there's no wind,
the flag doesn't move.
There's some reason in the statement
that the wind moves the flag
and therefore,
the wind that is moving
and not the flag.
On the other hand,
the wind is invisible
and it's beyond our capacity
to perceive the wind itself moving.
Listening to this naive discussion
which seemed to get them nowhere,
Eno stepped up to them and said,
it's neither the wind nor the flag
that's moving.
It's your mind that's moving.
This direct solution
from the subjective standpoint
put an end to the endless
dualistic discussion
and the two monks hearing it
were struck with awe
and greatly impressed.
Since there were Buddhist monks
in training,
they must have known
that of the basic Buddhist teachings,
such as every phenomena
is only due to mind
or that nothing exists
outside of mind.
Brother Eno's statement,
your mind is moving,
came directly out
of the experiential fact
which has nothing to do
with intellectual interpretation.
In other words,
it was the natural working
of Eno's Zen
and the two monks
intuitively recognized it.
That's why they were impressed.
Master Muman's real intention
in introducing this khan
is also to be grasped here
by the statement,
your mind is moving.
He wished his disciples
to open their Zen eye
to the experiential truth
which transcends
intellectual understanding.
The mind moves.
What is a moving mind?
What is a still mind?
What is a mind?
Back in that other khan,
we were talking about
think of neither good nor evil.
At that very moment,
what is the true self?
Master Muman made a statement.
He says,
therefore,
when the world collapses,
it is indestructible.
The term world in China
and Japan carries two meanings,
the moving
and the changing,
that is temporal
and direction,
which is spatial.
the term thus already
connotes limitation,
change,
and collapse.
The true self,
which has absolute subjectivity,
freely makes use
of time and space
and knows
no such dichotomy
as collapsing
or not collapsing.
Therefore,
the meeting
at Mount,
at the Vulture Peak,
is definitely present here.
and even when
the world collapses,
the true self
is ever indestructible.
Shibiyama says,
let me stress
the point once more.
The true self
is one's original,
true nature
in which
not a thought
of discrimination
is working.
It is the true self
awakened
to the Buddha nature.
It is the true self
that is one
with reality.
From ancient times,
various names
have been given to it,
such as
the true self,
true person
of no title,
absolute being,
or it.
Ultimately speaking,
however,
the true self
can never be experienced
in the realm
of intellect
or knowledge.
There is no method
for you to attain it
other than
to thoroughly
cast away
your intellect
and reasoning
and personally
plunge into
the experiential fact
itself.
this time
and space
are an illusion
that we create
with mind.
And you see
through that illusion,
you see
that that conversation
the talks
by the Buddha
on Bolshe Peak
that Tenzin gave
is right here,
right now.
And you see
clearly
that past
and future
are nothing
but the manifestation
of this very
moment itself.
And the minute
you hook
another moment
onto this moment,
whether it's
a past moment
or a future moment,
you create
the illusion
of time
and you create
the illusion
of space.
Even the modern
physicists
can accept
that
these days.
Another interesting
side thing
that happened
in this khan
is recorded
in the Denkoroku
which is the
transmission
of the lamp.
It says
that the
venerable
Inju
who is the
abbot
of this monastery
heard from
the two monks
about this
mando
of this
lay buddhist
and was struck
with awe
and admiration.
I mean,
I guess the
reason they
were so impressed
is they figured
this guy
was just a
wandering
layman
that came
and he had
this deep
understanding.
So they went
and told
the master.
The next day
the master
invited Inu
into his room
and asked him
again about
the discussion
on the wind
and the flag.
The lay
buddhist
gave a very
clear answer.
The venerable
Inju
spontaneously
stood up
and said
lay brother
you must
certainly be
no ordinary
person.
Who in the
world are
you?
Brother Inu
frankly told him
without concealment
how he had been
given the Dharma
sanction at Obai
years before.
Hearing it
the venerable
Inju
looked up
to brother
Inu
as his
teacher
and begged
him to be
their Zen
master.
Inju
announced
to the
public
though I
am only
an ordinary
being
dressed in
a robe
I have
now met
a living
bodhisattva.
And brother
Inu
was then
formally ordained
by the
venerable
Chikoh
and became
a Buddhist
monk.
His life
as the
sixth patriarch
Inu
started here
and his
great activities
as his
Zen master
developed
from this
time.
Can you
imagine
the
abbot
of that
monastery
recognizing
the deep
understanding
of this
stranger
that walked
in who
was a
layman
turns over
the monastery
to him
and becomes
the student.
Not much
of a chance
of that
happening
these days
said I think
in Muman's
commentary
he says
it is
neither
the wind
nor the
flag
nor the
mind
that's
moving.
Where do
you see
the heart
of the
patriarch?
Not the
wind
not the
flag
not the
mind.
He's
disagreeing
with the
six
patriarchs.
What's
going on
there?
If you
look
again
I've
mentioned
this before
the ten
ox-herding
pictures
try to
visualize
those ten
ox-herding
pictures
as a
wheel
that
starts off
before the
ten ox-herding
picture.
the first
thing
let's say
is the
world of
samsara.
If you
look at
that world
of
samsara
the next
step
is the
search for
the ox.
Before
in the
world of
samsara
there's pain
there's confusion
and there's
doubt.
Lots of
questions.
Now for some
reason
whatever the
reason may
be
and it's
different for
all of
us
we
raise the
bodhi
mind.
Raising
the
bodhi
mind
or the
bodhicitta
in Sanskrit
means
the
aspiration
for
enlightenment.
And until
that happens
the search
doesn't even
begin.
You don't
even begin
looking.
Once
that happens
you begin
the search.
and then
by
getting
involved
in practice
developing
joriki
developing
concentration
the next
ox-hating
picture
is seeing
the traces.
Now the
interesting thing
is when the
search begins
and while
you're building
joriki in
concentration
the one
thing that's
emphasized
is doubt.
the very
thing
that's got
to do
with the
pain and
confusion
in the
world of
samsara.
The teacher
says make
it the
great
doubt.
Fill
yourself
with the
great
doubt.
Instead
of retreating
from it
instead of
avoiding the
doubt
the
questions
you're
told to
magnify
them
and absorb
yourself
totally
into them.
And so
you develop
concentration
in joriki
and you
see the
traces.
Seeing the
traces of
the self
of the
ox at
this point
is an
intellectual
thing.
You begin
to understand
as you've
developed
the joriki
and understanding
begins to
emerge.
But it's
still very
very
intellectual.
It has
lots to
do with
the
sutras
and
understanding
of
Buddhism.
But as
the sitting
continues
samadhi
begins to
develop.
Single
pointedness
of mind.
The kind
of thing
that many
of you
are dipping
in and
out of
right about
at this
point
in the
sashim.
And then
we see
the bull.
See the
self.
We don't
understand it.
We haven't
taken hold
of it.
We see it.
That's
where the
first
khan
comes in.
Working
on the
first
khan
has to
do
specifically
with
understanding
the
self,
the
true
self.
And
going
through
the
first
khan
and
really
taking
hold
of
the
bull,
taking
hold
of
the
self
is
what's
called
khan
shou,
seeing
the
true
nature.
And
then
following
khan
shou,
there's
a series
of
koans
that
help
clarify
it,
to
make
it
clear.
Usually
it's
not
a
khan
shou,
usually
it's
a
glimpse,
kind
of like
seeing
the
vague
outlines
of
something.
And
these
200
koans
that
follow
really
clarify
what it
is
that
you
see.
And
that's
called
taming
the
bull.
Once
you
have
hold
of
the
self,
once
you
see
how
the
self
is
functioning,
all
of
the
delusion
is
still
there
and
it's
still
going.
The
anger,
confusion,
pain,
it's
all
still
functioning.
But
somehow
you
now
have
a
sense
of
how
it
arises
and
you
begin
working
on
it,
which
is
a
long
process,
taming
the
bull.
And
then
the
next
step
is
riding
the
bull
home.
Its
control
is
attained.
now
free
to
use
the
self
easily.
And
about
this
time
you're
working
on
intermediate
cons.
Somewhere
in
these
three
steps,
catching
the
bull,
taming
the
bull,
riding
the
bull
home,
the
sense
of
search
begins
to
end.
See,
you
just
do
it
at
this
point.
The
way
goes
on
by
itself.
The
hand
strikes
and
we
do
zaze.
The
sound
of
the
drum
we
do
sammo.
Den
show
we
do
service.
umpan
we
eat
our
meals.
Shinri
in the
morning
we
wake
up.
And
there's
no
sense
of
searching,
there's
no
sense
of
anything
other
than
practicing
our
lives.
Somewhere
in
there
that
usually
develops.
Then
as the
advanced
cons
come
on,
we
reach
the
point
where
the
bull
is
forgotten.
The
ox
is
forgotten.
The
self
is
forgotten.
And
the
environment
remains.
There's
no
sense
of a
separate
and
distinct
entity.
Not
only
no
sense
of
it,
it's
very
easy
to
conjure
up
the
idea
of
that.
But
your
actual
working,
your
actual
functioning
is
as
if
there
is
only
the
environment
and
not
the
self.
And
what
you
do
is
a
tip
off.
How you
relate to
things is a
tip off.
How much,
to what degree
this is
functioning.
That's the
seventh step.
The
eighth step
is
both
bull
and
environment
are
forgotten.
The
self
and the
environment
are both
forgotten.
Nothing
remains.
What we
call
shunyata.
This
is
eight
steps
from the
time of
the
first
opening
along.
The
first
opening
is
fourth
step.
This
is
the
eighth
step.
What we
call
the
pure
dharmakaya.
At this
point,
all
doubt
is
crushed.
The
ninth
step,
the
body
of
bliss
returns
to the
source,
it's
called.
what we
call
the
sambokaya.
We
chant
this
dharmakaya,
sambokaya,
and
nirvanakaya.
Nirvanakaya
is the
last one,
the
tenth
step,
bliss
bestowing
hands.
No
trace of
enlightenment
remains.
Now,
in order
to
appreciate
what was
happening
with
Master
Eno,
actually,
Master
Eno's
statement,
it's not
the flag
that moves,
it's not
the wind
that moves,
it's the
mind that
moves.
It
actually
misses it.
How come,
didn't he
know?
that it's
not the
flag,
not the
wind,
not the
mind?
Why do
you say
it's the
mind that
moves?
And in
the poem,
it makes
it clear,
in the
poem,
Muman
calls it
his great
compassion.
In the
poem,
it says,
the wind
moves,
the flag
moves,
the mind
moves,
all of
them miss
it.
Though
he knows
how to
open his
mouth,
he does
not see,
he was
caught by
words.
What was
Eno's
real
intention,
was the
question of
Muman,
is neither
the wind,
nor the
flag,
nor the
mind that's
moving,
where do
you see the
heart of
the patriarch?
If you
can see it
clearly,
you'll know
that the
two monks
obtained gold
instead of
intending to
buy iron.
You'll also
know that the
patriarch could
not repress
his compassion
and made
an awkward
scene.
That statement
right there,
could not
repress his
compassion
and made
an awkward
scene.
It tells
what Eno
was doing.
you see,
from the
point of
view
of the
patriarch,
he could
see the
whole thing,
but from
the point
of view
of the
monks,
they were
somewhere at
that third
ox-herding
picture.
They hadn't
seen the
nature of
the self
at all
yet.
And so
Master Eno
says,
it's your
minds that
are moving.
And
Mooman
is presenting
it
from the
point of
view of
the ninth
ox-herding
picture.
It's not
the wind,
it's not
the flag,
it's not
the mind.
Another way
of seeing
it,
is all
three,
neither
move or
don't move.
So we
have a
tendency
to look
at Zen
in a
very
simplistic
way.
As our
Sangha
matures
and people
start developing
clarity
and get a
little more
sophisticated
and read
a little bit
more about
Zen
and pass
a few
more
cons,
everybody
is looking
for,
like the
secret
key,
that if
you figure
this out,
you've got
the whole
thing
down pat.
And
it's a
very, very
simplistic
way of
looking at
it.
Anywhere
you'd stick
you'd stick
in Zen,
any position
that you
would take,
you'd get
nailed.
and sometimes
you have to
do that
very thing
like Eno
did.
Out of
his
compassion
to help
these monks,
he made
a stupid
statement.
He knew
what he
was doing.
I mean,
it wasn't
a mistake.
He was
helping
these monks.
But in
the process
of doing
that,
in the
process
of being
unable
to repress
his great
compassion,
he made
a very
awkward
scene.
It's
moving,
yet there's
no movement.
It's
standing
still,
yet there
is no
standstill.
For all
that,
moving
will do,
and standing
still will
do.
This is
the freedom
of Zen,
which
transcends
subject and
object,
movement and
non-movement,
and real
peace is
enjoyed.
Only
when one
lives
with this
freedom.
There's
an old
haiku
poem
that's
anonymous
that says
this
lace
curtain
just
swinging
in the
cool
breeze.
Shibiyama
says,
let us
read
into the
heart
of this
poem.
in this
commentary,
Master
Mumman,
when he
says it's
not the
wind,
it's not
the flag,
it's not
the mine,
what he's
alluding to
is another
interesting story
that took
place with
the nun,
Mioshin.
And it
seems that
this
nun,
Mioshin,
overheard a
conversation
with one
of the
monasteries.
There were
17 monks
who had
come to
see
Master
Kyogen.
I don't
know if
it's in
this
translation.
Yeah,
it is.
This
nun,
Mioshin,
who was
a disciple
of
Master
Ekiju,
she was
in charge
of the
guest
house
outside
the
temple,
and
one
day
17
monks
came
from
a
far
away
country
to
see
Master
Gyosan.
They
stayed
at her
lodging
house.
In
the
evening,
they
got
together
by the
fireside
and
began
the
discussion,
because
they
didn't
do
sazen,
evening
in
China.
They
were
having
a
discussion
around
the
fire.
They
discussed
the
khan,
neither
the
wind
nor
the
flag.
Nun
Mioshin,
listening
to their
talk,
disapproved
of all
of them.
She
was
listening
from the
other
side
of
a
screen,
and
she
said,
you
17
donkeys
have
never
come
across
Buddhism
even
in
a
dream.
What
a
pity.
So
instead
of being
angry
by the
statement,
which would
be very
unusual,
they
were
impressed
by the
statement,
and they
asked her
for
instruction.
So she
came into
the room,
and she
said,
it is neither
the wind
nor the flag
nor the
mind that's
moving.
Her
clear voice
went straight
to their
hearts,
and the
17 monks
were all
enlightened.
It's
the only
history,
the only
thing in
Zen
history of
so many
people being
enlightened
all at
once.
17 of
them,
one shot.
She
should have
been the
sixth
patriarch.
In
this
commentary,
Master
Mumman is
quoting
Nunmioshin's
reply exactly
from the
story,
and then
asks
pressingly,
where do
you see
the heart
of the
patriarch?
If it
is truly
spoken,
if it
is truly
heard,
the awakening
is right
there.
In the
second part
of his
commentary,
Master
Mumman
says,
if you
can directly
and clearly
see through
the
koan of
neither
the wind
nor the
flag nor
the mind
is moving,
you will
know that
the two
monks who
were engaged
in the
foolish
argument made
an unexpected
big profit.
It is
as if
they had
obtained gold
while paying
for iron.
As for
Master
Eno,
he could
not help
putting in
a word
out of his
compassion
and remarked,
your mind
is moving.
You will
realize that
this meddling
is just
nonsensical.
This again
is Mumman's
usual paradoxical
way of
expressing
his admiration.
In a
sense,
it's true,
it's
nonsense
for the
sixth
patriarch to
say that.
That's
bullshit.
And at
the same
time,
it's
wonderful
that his
compassion
is so
great
and his
skill
is so
great
that he
knew
the right
thing at
the right
moment
to say.
Master
Seppo
said,
commenting
on these
words of
Master
Eno.
Great
Master
Seppo,
you'll
get to
know
Seppo
someday.
He's
in the
Blue Cliff
Records
and every
coin in
the
Blue Cliff
Records
has got
some
commentary
by him
which is
usually
very
sarcastic.
He's
worse
than
Mumman.
Great
Master
though he
is,
what an
awkward
statement
Master
Eno
made
when he
said,
your
mind
is
moving.
If
I
had
been
there,
I
would
have
given
the
monks
30
blows
of my
Mumman's
poem.
The
wind
moves,
the
flag
moves,
the
mind
moves,
all
of
them
miss
it.
Though
he
knows
how
to
open
his
mouth,
he
does
not
see
he
was
caught
by
words.
And
the
minute
we
open
our
mouth,
we're
hung
up
on
the
words
and
we're
missing.
And
of
course,
the
sixth
patriarch
knew
this.
Even
the
turning
word
itself
misses
it.
But
the
monk
gets
it
somehow.
You
see,
when
a
turning
word
is
functioning,
when
it's
really
functioning,
it's
a
word,
a
saying,
a
blow,
a
shout,
a
sound,
a
pointing,
that's
done at
the
appropriate,
at
that
Maslow's
peak
experience
time,
when
the
person
is
just
at
the
edge
of
seeing
it,
and the
right
word
just
turns
it
over
for
them.
Being
a
word,
it
usually
misses
it,
in
and
of
itself,
but
it
has
significance
for
that
particular
person
at
that
time.
Let's
see,
what
is
the
way,
Joshu
asks,
nonsense.
If
he
had
asked
Master
Rinzai
that
question,
Rinzai
would
have
hit
him
in
the
mouth.
Or
made a
group,
Basso
probably
would have
given
him
a
great
shout.
Gutai
would
have
held
up
his
finger.
But
Nansen
said,
ordinary
mind
is
the
way.
That
statement,
it
misses
it.
But
not
for
Joshu,
you
see.
Nansen
knew
Joshu
in
the
workings
of
his
mind,
where
he
was,
where
he
was
stuck.
And
at
the
right
moment,
said
the
right
thing.
And
so
Joshu
saw
it.
And
that's
what he
means
here.
Though
he
knows
how to
open
his
mouth,
he
does
not
see.
He
was
caught
by
words.
Now
I
mentioned
those
ox
herding
pictures,
I
mentioned
the
wheel,
to
see
it
as
a
wheel.
Eleven
spokes.
First
spoke
is
samsara,
the
world
of
samsara,
pain
and
confusion
and
doubt.
The
next
one
is
the
search.
And
you
go
through
each
step,
you
end
up
at
the
tenth
one.
And
the
tenth
one,
bliss
bestowing
hands,
is
coming
down
from
the
mountain,
back
into
the
marketplace.
the
poem
says
everyone
I
look
upon
is
enlightened,
bare
chested,
covered
with the
dirt of
the
world,
wine
jug in
hand,
I
return
to the
marketplace.
Returning
to the
world
of
samsara.
And that's
what
Ina
was doing
here,
returning
to this
world to
teach.
where is
that
world
of
samsara
other
than
our
mind?
We
carry it
with
us
wherever
we
go.
Someone
said to
me
today,
working
on a
coin,
they
realized
in
working
with
this
particular
coin,
that
there's
really
no
place
to
hide.
And
it's
true.
Samsara
is
everywhere.
Even
on a
remote
mountaintop
there's
samsara.
Even
in the
Zen
monastery,
samsara
is with
us.
It's
not in
the
outside
world.
It's
in us.
We
are
samsara.
We
carry it
wherever
we go.
From
place
to
place.
From
relationship
to
relationship.
From
birth
to
death.
We
repeat
the
same
scenario
over
and
over
and
over
again.
We
try to
avoid
it
by
changing.
It's
always
there
again.
We
try to
avoid
it
by
occupying
ourselves,
entertaining
ourselves.
Whenever
you come
down
from
the
high,
there
it
is,
it's
still
there.
you
cool
out
from
the
hangover,
it's
still
there.
Somehow
it hasn't
solved
anything.
And
that's
the way
it
goes.
And
if we
really
look
at it,
it
goes
right
back
to
our
childhood.
We're
still
hassling
on a
sophisticated
level,
of course.
The
same
bullshit
that
we
were
hassling
when we
were five
years old,
six
years old,
as we
developed
the
patterns
of our
lives.
And
it'll
go on.
That's
our
karma.
Endlessly.
Until
we put a
stop to
it.
Put it
to rest.
Empty
out the
mind.
die of
the
great
death.
The
death
of
the
ego.
We
should
do it
right
now.
Or
we
can
die
little
by
little.
over
and
over
again.
Ten
thousand
times.
Every
time
we're
confronted
by
the
same
pain,
same
confusion,
same
anger,
same
frustration,
same
neurosis.
Ten
thousand
deaths
day
after
endless
day
for the
rest
of our
lives.
more
we
can
put
it
to
rest.
The
choice
is
ours.
Choice
is
yours.
Nobody
else
can
do
it.
That's
you.
So
please
do
it.
raise
the
body
mind.
Don't
be
content
with
half
of it.
Don't
be content
with
tranquility.
Really
break
through.
find out
about this
mind.
About
this
true
self.
See
it
clearly.
Really
understand
what
discriminating
consciousness
is all
about.
In this
day that's
left,
says
sashin.
We have
the
opportunity
to do
this.
It only
takes a
moment
to
break
through.
We
tend
to think
of it
as
spending
a couple
of years
in a
monastery.
we're
doing
lots
and lots
of
sashins.
Master
Eno
never
even
sat
zazen.
That
was
another
thing.
Never
did
zazen.
It was
in a
rice
shack.
Never
even
heard
of
Buddhism
before.
That
was
totally
illiterate,
uneducated.
Heard
the
Diamond
Sutra
was
the
first
time
you
ever
heard
it.
So
it
only
takes
a
minute
to
turn
our
heads
around
180
degrees.
And
then
that
turning
around
is
a
transformation.
Change.
High
impact
change
on our
lives.
The way
we
perceive
ourselves.
The way
we
perceive
reality.
The way
we
function
in that
reality.
So
please
do it.
Raise
the
Bodhi
part.
Make
yourself
free.
Give
life
to your
true
self.
It's
there.
It's
always
been
there.
You're
not
going
to
find
out
anything
you
didn't
know.
But
it's
so
obscured,
so
piled
with
conditioning
from our
parents,
our
teachers,
our
country,
our
education,
our
friends,
our
peers.
So
conditioned
that we
can't see
it.
And can't
function
without it.
and so
in this
process
of sitting
we empty
that out
and get
down to
the real
nitty-gritty
of what we're
about,
the true
self,
the ground
of being.
we've got
some extra
time
tonight,
so please
get a good
night's
rest.

this
place
and
you
can't save
us too.
