The Gateless Gate, Case 28, Ryutan's Candle, Main Case.
Toksan once called on Ryutan to ask for instruction and stayed until night fell.
Ryutan said, it's getting late, you had better leave.
At last Toksan said goodbye, lifted up the door curtain and went out.
Noticing that it was dark, he turned back and said, it's dark outside.
Ryutan thereupon lit a candle and handed it to him.
Toksan was about to take it when Ryutan blew it out.
At this Toksan was all of a sudden enlightened.
He made a bow.
Ryutan asked, what realization do you have?
Toksan replied, from now on I will not doubt the sayings of any of the great Zen masters in the world.
The next day, Ryutan mounted the rostrum and declared,
among the monks here there is a fellow whose fangs are like swords, whose mouth is like a bowl of blood.
You may strike him with a stick, but he will not turn his head.
Some day in the future, he will establish his way on a steep and lofty peak.
Toksan then took out his notes and commentaries on the Diamond Sutra.
And in front of the monastery hall, he held up a burning torch and said,
Even though one masters the various profound philosophies, it's like placing a single strand of hair in the great sky.
Even if one gains all the essential knowledge in the world, it's like throwing a drop of water into a deep ravine.
Taking up his notes and commentaries, he burned them all, and he left with gratitude.
Master Mumman's commentary.
When Toksan had not yet left his home, his mind was indignant and his tongue sharp.
He confidently came to the south in order to exterminate the special transmission outside the scriptures.
When he reached the road to Ryushu, he talked to an old woman who sold Tenjin.
The old woman said, Venerable monk, what books do you carry in your box?
Toksan said, they are the notes and commentaries on the Diamond Sutra.
The old woman said, it's said in the sutra that the past mind is unattainable, the present mind is unattainable, the future mind is unattainable.
Which mind, Venerable monk, are you going to light up?
Toksan was unable to answer this question and had to shut his mouth tight.
Even so, he could not die the great death at the old woman's words,
and finally asked her, is there a place that I can study nearby?
The old woman replied, Master Ryutan lives five miles away.
Arriving at Ryutan's monastery, he was completely defeated.
It has to be said, his former words and his latter words do not agree.
Ryutan is like a mother who, because she loves her child too much, does not realize how meddlesome she herself is.
Finding a little piece of live coal in Toksan, he quickly poured muddy water over him.
Looking at it calmly, I would say that the whole story is just a farce.
Master Muman's poem
Far better seeing the face than hearing the name
Far better hearing the name than seeing the face
Though he saved his nose, alas, he has lost his eyes
I've presented this koan several times already
It's a good one
It's a good one because it
points out
the first breakthrough
and if you look at the subsequent koans
that involve Master Toksan
that are part of the koan collections
you begin to see
how he goes through
development
finally to the
tenth stage
which is presented in the koan
Toksan carries his bowls
In this koan, he was very young
and
just
really beginning his practice
Koan following this
is after his enlightenment
where he visits Isan
and there
his greenness
shows
and Isan
brings him around another
step
another stage
and then
finally in the koan
of Toksan carries his bowl
he's a very mature
and ripe
old
master
there's two successes
that were very well known
are Ganto and Seppo
and there's been many koans
regarding the two of them
Toksan's
has a particular
there's a particular
family style
that
comes out of
various lineages
and one of the things
that you begin to
pick up on
as you study
the various koans
is what that
particular family style is
there's a
particular
way
that they have
Isan's lineage
or Toksan's lineage
or Rinzai's lineage
or Tozan's lineage
a particular way
of looking at
a koan
or a particular
emphasis
on some aspect
of the teachings
there are many ways
to look at the teachings
and
there are
many different styles
because there are
many different
teachers
and different ways
of seeing it
it's all the same truth
but it's presented
in different ways
emphasized
in different ways
not only does that
exist within Zen itself
but also from
various
in various schools
of Buddhism
there are different
emphasis
we say
many times
that
in order to
really appreciate
the koan
you need to be
the koan
and that's the key
here
because
here is
an encounter
between
Toksan
and Ryutan
they're having
a conversation
Ryutan says
it's getting late
you should leave
and
Toksan
gets up to leave
and steps outside
and it's dark
he comes back
in and says
it's dark out there
Ryutan lights a candle
and hands it to him
Toksan
reaches for the candle
Ryutan blows it out
Toksan
is enlightened
so how are we
to appreciate
what was going on
there
what the dynamics
was that was going on
there
and of course
in order to appreciate it
you have to understand
the whole story
and more than
understanding
the whole story
you need to
appreciate
it
from the
point of view
of
Ryutan
Toksan
and the old woman
to really see
this koan
completely
there are three
important characters
in this koan
each one
is seeing
the world
in a very different way
the old woman
and Ryutan
were trying
to bring
Toksan around
to get him
to open his eye
Toksan's eye
was yet closed
and
it's kind of
interesting
also
to appreciate
the fact
that Toksan
wasn't looking
for anything
at that time
Toksan
wasn't a student
he had all
the answers
he had great
faith
in what he
understood
and he had
great determination
clearly
but what he
didn't have
was great doubt
and it's because
of that lack
of great doubt
that he was
caught in
all of his
intellectual
understanding
you see
Toksan was
born in a
northern
remote
district
of China
and he was
very young
when he was
first ordained
as a monk
and he went
to the capital
of the province
and studied
the Vinaya
and the sutras
and scriptures
and he
developed
through his
studies
he was very
very bright
he developed
through his
studies
a very deep
and profound
understanding
of the Diamond
Sutra
and
because of
that
great understanding
of the Diamond
Sutra
he became
a very
respected
lecturer
and scholar
monk
in China
at that
period of
time
I guess
this was
around
700
800
AD
the
monasteries
were the
seats of
learning
and
monks
were
also
scholars
and
this is
the reputation
that
Toksan
had developed
in a
very very
at a
very very
young age
in those
days
Zen
was
really
growing
in the
provinces
of the
south
of China
and
the
Buddhism
that he
was studying
was in
Zen
and at
that time
it was
the beginnings
of Zen
and Zen
teachers
were considered
kind of
rabble-rousers
and making
these outrageous
statements
that Zen
is a special
transmission
outside the
scriptures
now here's
somebody that
had spent
many many
years
becoming an
expert on
the scriptures
and these
people down
south are
saying all
the scriptures
in the world
aren't going
to do you
any good
so you have
to appreciate
that position
first of all
he spends
10
15 years
studying
these scriptures
becoming an
expert in
them
understanding
them
trusting
them
living his
life in
accord with
the Vinaya
which are
the precepts
and the
and the
scriptures
themselves
and not
only the
precepts
that we
do in
modern
times
but the
250
precepts
of the
Vinaya
sect
which means
he lived
a very
very
religious
quote unquote
life
maintaining
those precepts
and studying
the sutras
every day
of his life
so he was
a little
outraged
that these
people down
south were
making this
comment that
you don't need
to know any
of that
that that's
not what
Buddhism is
about
those sutras
that he was
studying
the word of
the Buddha
that's what
sutra means
every one of
them starts
off with
thus I have
heard
the Buddha
when he was
at such and
such said
and then
the whole sutra
is what the
Buddha said
and these
arrogant
heretics
of southern
Buddhism
were saying
that
the truth
of Buddhism
is outside
the scriptures
no reliance
on words
and letters
direct pointing
to the human
mind
and the
realization
of Buddhahood
so
being indignant
at that
and of course
anyone hearing
that superficially
immediately
concludes
that it
means you
ignore the
sutras
and a lot
of people
to this day
think that
that's what
that means
you don't
need to
you don't
need to
study
anything
in Zen
all you need
to do
is become
enlightened
sutras
don't matter
that's not
true
well they
think that
all you need
to do
is become
enlightened
and that
enlightenment
is above
morality
it's
amoral
beyond
morality
in fact
those very
words were
used by
Alan Watts
and a lot
of us
got our
first inklings
of Zen
by reading
Alan Watts
because Alan
Watts never
practiced Zen
so it's
difficult for him
to know
what he was
doing
was just
drawing conclusions
on a basis
of what he
read
special transmission
outside the
scriptures
no reliance
on words
and letters
words and
letters
are the
precepts
words and
letters
are the
scriptures
if it's
outside of
that
therefore
you don't
have to
worry
about that
that's
not true
that same
misunderstanding
was part
of what
Toksan
had
and so
he
made up
his mind
he was
going to
exterminate
the heretics
that was
his great
determination
and he
made a
long
journey
on foot
carrying
his notes
and his
commentaries
and copies
of the
sutras
he was
seen off
by many
of his
friends
who were
pleased
at what
he was
going to
do
he himself
was in
very high
spirits
and from
that remote
district
he made
a long
trip
down the
Yangtze
river
to a
place
where
Zen
was
in
its
heyday
where he
knew
that there
were many
Zen
monasteries
and as
he was
walking
along the
road
one day
he stopped
by a
small
tea house
by the
roadside
and asked
for
Tenjin
which is
a snack
and this
old woman
who ran
the tea
house
saw this
very elated
looking
young monk
carrying this
big box
on his
shoulders
and she
asked him
venerable
monk
what books
are you
carrying in
that big
box
and
Diamond
Shoe
as he
was
as his
nickname
was
expert
on the
Diamond
Sutra
said
well these
are commentaries
and notes
on the
Diamond
Sutra
and the
old woman
kind of a
change
came over
her
from this
very
quiet
shopkeeper
woman
came kind
of a
stern
look
on her
face
and her
eyes
narrowed
she
looked
straight
at him
and said
if I
can
if you
can answer
a question
that I
have about
that Sutra
I'll
give you
Tenjin
if you
can't
I won't
serve you
in this
tea
house
of course
keep in
mind
that
old
Diamond
Shoe
Toksan
he wasn't
searching
he wasn't
looking for
anything
he was
convinced
that he
already
had
everything
he had
all the
answers
he understood
the Diamond
Sutra
he was a
monk
he was
highly
acclaimed
as a
commentator
on the
Diamond
Sutra
so he
had
great
faith
and
this
fact
that
this
old
woman
of a
tea
house
was
going
to
question
him
on the
Diamond
Sutra
he had
been
questioned
by
experts
by
scholars
by
great
scholars
and he
always
was able
to
handle
it
so it
didn't
mean
anything
to him
so he
said
you can
ask him
anything
you like
now
Kenjin
the
little
snack
that
the
woman
was
serving
the
Chinese
characters
for that
that say
Kenjin
also mean
light up
your mind
like many
words
and many
particularly
Chinese
characters
there are
multiple
meanings
to it
so
you
could
read
those
characters
abstractly
out of
any
context
as
light up
your
mind
or
you
could
read
it
as
the
name
of
this
particular
snack
a little
snack
that
went
with
tea
so
the
old
woman
said
to
him
in
the
Diamond
Sutra
it's
written
that
the
past
mind
is
unattainable
ungraspable
and
that
the
present
mind
is
unattainable
or
ungraspable
and
that
the
future
mind
is
unattainable
ungraspable
is
that
true
and
Diamond
Shoe
said
quite
confidently
yes
it's
an
important
passage
actually
in
the
Diamond
Sutra
where
Buddha
is
dealing
with
the
nature
of
mind
the
old
woman
says
that
being
the
case
which
mind
are
you
going
to
light
up
and
Diamond
Shoe
was
completely
flustered
he had
studied
religious
philosophy
he was
an expert
on the
Diamond
Sutra
and he
couldn't
say a
word
in
response
to this
question
based
based on
the
experiential
truth
of that
Sutra
and
old
master
commenting
on this
is what
a pity
Diamond
Shoe
could have
had an
opportunity
of
awaking
here
the
old
woman
gave
him
exactly
what
would
have
been
a
perfect
turning
word
if he
had been
ripe
enough
but he
wasn't
ripe
you see
what
hadn't
happened
yet
was the
great
doubt
the
question
he
didn't
have
a
question
it was
only
after
this
old
woman
rammed
him up
against
the
solid
brick
wall
a mile
high
that
that
question
began
to
fester
a
great
doubt
he
must
have
felt
something
very
deep
in
his
mind
it
must
have
shook
the
very
foundations
of his
practice
it's
what we
call
a
killing
sword
and
we
have
them
in
our
koan
system
at
various
places
along
the
way
what
happens
is
a
student
will
break
through
a
koan
and
then
begin
studying
the
subsequent
koans
and
usually
they
move
along
relatively
quickly
and
as
they
build
confidence
and
clarity
suddenly
there's
an
oblique
turn
and
the
killing
sword
comes
out
a
koan
that
takes
away
everything
that
they've
seen
up to
that
point
that
disqualifies
negates
everything
that they've
understood
up until
that point
and
it
begins
to
shatter
the
whole
thing
but
some
students
don't
shatter
they
don't
die
is
what
I'm
saying
they
just
persist
and
the
more
they
persist
the
more
they
deeper
they
impale
themselves
on
that
killing
sword
and
it's
kind
of
an
interesting
place
in
practice
because
you know
as a
teacher
it's
it's
interesting
in most
of the
places
along the
way
it's
easy
to
pretty
much
direct
the
student
in such
a way
as they
don't get
too far
off
and bring
them back
so that
they don't
get too
discouraged
it's
easy
to
redirect
them
but
when
they're
moving
through
these
koans
and
they
get
to
that
particular
koan
there's
nothing
that
the
teacher
can
do
except
to
kill
them
and
people
don't
want
to
die
so
what
happens
is
sometimes
the
student
we
just
lose
the
student
they
can't
deal
with
the
frustration
of not
being able
to see
it
and they
leave
which is
a pity
but there's
nothing
that the
teacher
can do
so that
student
will
usually
go off
sometimes
they go
off to
another
teacher
and they
find out
that
same
thing
they're
still
stuck
so it's
got nothing
to do
with the
teacher
it's got
to do
with
not being
willing
to die
the great
death
and you
have to
die
the great
death
the death
of the
ego
several
times
during the
way
before you
get to
that place
where
body and
mind
have fallen
away
completely
it's a
tough
journey
so
old
diamond
shoe
was
still
scuffling
he wasn't
ready to
die
but this
old woman
pushing him
up against
the wall
like that
created
that question
and
sent him
off to
Ryutan's
monastery
and when
he walked
into
Ryutan's
monastery
he still
walks in
kind of
arrogant
he comes
in
and in a
loud voice
he said
I've long
heard of
the
well-known
Ryutan
Ryutan
literally
means
dragon
lake
so I've
long
heard
of the
dragon
lake
now that
I'm here
I don't
see
neither
I see
neither
a dragon
nor a
lake
and
old man
Ryutan
immediately
saw
by that
remark
where he
was coming
from
not only
was he
coming
from the
position
of
Shunyata
but he
was coming
from the
position of
Shunyata
understood
intellectually
and all
of that
was clear
from that
statement
Ryutan
says
you have
arrived at
Ryutan
in person
he revealed
his
spirituality
valley
and they're
completely
conveyed
in the
words
in person
no dragon
no lake
what you
see is
what you
get
this is
Ryutan
the true
Ryutan
again
Toksan
couldn't
couldn't
break
through
Ryutan
served it
to him
on a
platter
the old
woman in
the tea
house
served it
to him
on a
platter
and neither
time
was he
prepared to
take food
take Dharma
food
so he
ended up
staying
studying
with
Ryutan
and
again and
again
they met
and in
those days
in China
the face
to face
encounter
depending upon
the size
of the
monastery
hadn't
evolved into
the form
that it
evolves in
now
particularly
where it
was a
monastery
of two
or three
monks
so sometimes
the
encounters
would last
for long
periods of
time
much the
same as
they last
when a
student is
in the
ninth
and tenth
stages of
training
most of
the training
at that
point
doesn't take
place in
the
doksan
room
you know
within two
or three
minutes
but they're
long
periods of
studying
together
usually at
the abbot's
quarters
where
days
are spent
and the
oral
teachings
are
transmitted
at that
point
they're
not
the
and
through
koans
or through
memorizing
texts
but now
all the
gaps
that the
student
might have
the teacher
begins to
work with
and fill
them in
all the
koans
are gone
over again
and
so that
a broad
understanding
of how to
work with
different
kinds of
students
and it's
more in
that style
that the
early
Tang
dynasty
training
face-to-face
took place
and
so one
evening
when they
were working
together
real late
into the
evening
and
Diamond
Shoe
was getting
personal
instruction
and they
were doing
Mondo
question and
answer
he still
wasn't able
to get
it
and at
this point
he began
to get
very very
eager
and even
desperate
unable to
really grasp
what
Ryutan
was trying
to show
him
through logic
and argument
that's what he
was trying
to do
that was his
way of
understanding
these
things
he came
from that
school
of Zen
where you
very much
the way
we learn
the way
we learn
philosophy
it was
interesting
I was
reading an
article
recently
about
Buddhist
psychology
that
Trungpa Rinpoche
talked
that he
had given
to a group
of psychologists
trying to
get them
to understand
the difference
in the
way
Buddhist
psychology
is understood
and
Western
psychology
is understood
and he
said
you know
when you
speak of
experiential
in
Western
psychology
you're
basically
speaking about
group dynamics
or group
communication
a group
of people
working
together
he said
when we
say
experiential
in Buddhist
psychology
it's a
whole
different
ball of
wax
it's
personal
it's
personal
realization
it's
personal
transformation
and it's
outside of
a group
it's direct
it's immediate
and it happens
from within
one's own
experience
and that's
the basic
difference
between the
two
and he
went on
to say
that 80%
of
the
Western
way of
training
a
psychologist
is
theoretical
and
philosophical
so basically
intellectual
it's basically
the way we
learn most
things
even
medical
school
even though
there's a
period of
internship
required
the bulk
of what
a physician
learns
he learns
from a
textbook
in a
classroom
through
lectures
through
demonstrations
and so
on
rather than
experiential
experiential
part comes
at the
very very
end
it's not
a continuous
thing
all the way
through
medical
school
and so
there's a
very big
difference
between that
kind of an
approach
to a
subject
and the
approach
that
old
Ryutan
was trying
to reveal
to
Diamond
Shoe
who kept
trying to
bring it
back into
his way
of
working
with
things
which is
to develop
a
logical
rational
linear
understanding
of the
Diamond
Sutra
that's
what they
were
talking
about
and
what's
the
Diamond
Sutra
talking
about
what's
the whole
point of
the Diamond
Sutra
and those
of you
who are
working in the
first and
second stages
of training
should by now
have read it
several times
and again
and again
in that
sutra
page after
page
section
after section
the Buddha
reiterates
the basic
emptiness
of all
things
the
transitory
nature
of all
life
the
impermanence
of the
ten thousand
things
over and
over again
constantly
pointing
to that
absolute
basis
of reality
between
him
and
Sabuttai
the dialogue
goes back
and forth
evolving
and stating
and restating
in fact
one of the
characteristics
of it
is almost
redundant
once you
really see
what's being
said
you see
he's saying
the same
thing
over and
over and
over again
using different
ways of
presenting it
different examples
of how to
present it
and finally
he concludes
it with
the statement
thus
shall you
regard all
things
a flash
of lightning
in the
summer sky
a bubble
in a stream
a phantom
in a dream
is the way
he describes
reality
empty
of all
fixed
characteristics
Diamond
Shoe knew
this
Diamond Shoe
could quote
that sutra
from beginning
to end
could break
it down
analyze it
put it
together
backwards
forwards
and sidewards
he really
understood
it
and not
only that
he really
believed it
and unquestionably
it's a
profound
piece of
work
you really
penetrate the
Diamond Sutra
completely
your training
is over
he appreciated
the special
specialness
of that
sutra
but he
had not
realized it
and that's
what the old
woman was
going for
that's what
Ryutan
was going
for
and that's
what
Toksan
wasn't ready
yet for
couldn't hear
it
he was
deaf
he hadn't
made that
quantum leap
that
takes you
into another
dimension
and usually
that quantum
leap comes
out of a
crisis
of desperation
in virtually
every case
unfortunately
it's a drag
that most
people
need to
go
to that
state
the bottom
needs to
drop out
before
that leap
happens
finally
late into
the night
Ryutan
said
you better
leave
it's getting
late
Toksan
still
confused
his head
still
reeling
his doubt
multiplied
a hundred
thousand
times
by now
compared to
when he
met the
old woman
got up
to leave
kind of
stumbled
out the
door
realized it
was dark
and he
turned around
the old man
standing there
in the doorway
said it's
pitch dark
out here
not only
was
dark
out there
but his
mind too
must have
been like
an abyss
he was in
a touch
and go
situation
he was
teetering
on the
brink
of seeing
something
now he
was ripe
the right
push
the right
word
the right
gesture
could turn
it completely
around for
him
he was
ready
and Ryutan
began to
see this
so he lit
a candle
handed it
to him
in the
moment
Toksan
took the
candle
he blew
it out
in a
single
breath
Shibiyama
says what
superb
working
what
excellent
instruction
in an
instant
the whole
universe
was in
sheer
darkness
again
and at
this
moment
all of
a sudden
Toksan's
relativistic
self
fell away
it's like
pulling the
hoops off a
barrel and
the whole
thing
collapses
the world
collapses
the iron
mountain
crumbles
level with
the plane
nothing
remains
now Toksan
didn't
Ryutan
hadn't
planned that
I mean
that's not
part of
instructions
to Zen
teachers
you know
his teacher
didn't tell
him
someday
you'll find
a student
that when
he walks
out into
the dark
hand him
a candle
and blow
it out
and he'll
become
enlightened
I mean
Ryutan
was so
identified
with the
question
and the
agony
the struggle
the desperation
and the
question
of Toksan
and at
the same
time
seeing it
from his
own clarity
that he
was able
to act
spontaneously
in a
normal
situation
it was
dark
he needed
a candle
he gave
him the
candle
and probably
right at
that second
he
spontaneously
blew it
out
and the
whole world
collapsed
for Toksan
Toksan
was in
tears
trembling
bowed
before
Master
Ryutan
and
gratitude
what
realization
do you
have
Toksan
had seen
it clearly
there wasn't
a cloud
in his
mind
from now
on I will
not doubt
the sayings
of any
great Zen
masters in
the world
people
it seems
like a
very
lopsided
statement
but the
thing you
need to
understand
is what
he had
shattered
was the
rhinoceros
horn of
great doubt
as we
call it
he wouldn't
doubt
anything
before
that instant
he doubted
everything
he doubted
whether he
could take
another step
he doubted
whether he
was alive
or dead
he doubted
what Ryutan
was saying
he doubted
the diamond
sutra
he doubted
his own
breath
now
he doubted
nothing
the great
doubt
was shattered
he finally
saw for
himself
that which
does not
rely on
words and
letters
that which
transforms
one way
of perceiving
the self
and the
universe
and Ryutan
was of
course
ecstatic
Ryutan's
agony
was no
less
than
Toksan's
he struggled
every step
of the way
with him
so now
that
Toksan
was ecstatic
with joy
having seen
this
so was
Ryutan
ecstatic
with joy
and the
next day
he went
to the
head of
the assembly
and said
among the
monks here
there's an
extraordinary
fellow
his fangs
are as
sharp as
swords
his mouth
crimson
even though
you may
beat him
or strike him
he doesn't
turn
even a
hair
someday
he will
be a
great
teacher
this is
what
Ryutan
expected
of Toksan
and of
course
it was
true
Toksan
turned out
like that
but it
was a
little bit
premature
to say
it
in his
enthusiasm
as
as
Muman
says in
his
commentary
he was
like
like a
mother
who
because
she
loves
her
child
too
much
doesn't
realize
how
meddlesome
she
herself
is
finding
a little
piece
of live
coal
in Toksan
he quickly
poured
muddy
water
over
it
Toksan
was already
puffed up
about
ten times
his size
and
Ryutan
saying
this
he even
carried it
further
too
much
he was
still
green
he had
only seen
the beginning
of it
to let
him know
the rest
to say
that
was the
wrong
thing
to say
because
it
puffed
him
up
it
needs
to
refine
that
which
he's
seen
so that
it
manifests
in
every
aspect
of
life
Ryutan
said
someday
in the
future
he'll
be a
great
master
but
Ryutan
didn't
hear
that
he
just
heard
how
great
he
is
so
Toksan
also
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
and joy
you know
I mean
these guys
were feeding
off each
off each
other
takes
out
his
sutras
and notes
and
everything
else
that was
so
important
to him
that
made
that
thousand
mile
journey
to the
south
happen
and
he
brought
it
out
in front
of the
monastery
and
set
fire
to it
saying
however
thoroughly
you may
study
and master
the
profound
philosophy
compared to
the depth
of experiential
truth
it's like
placing a
strand of
hair in
the sky
it's
nothing
or throwing
a drop
of water
into a
deep
ravine
no matter
how many
theories
you learn
nothing
can compare
to the
absolute
basis
of reality
and then
he burned
the notes
and left
Tok San
with deep
gratitude
well it
took about
another
twenty years
of refinement
before he
became the
great master
Tok San
that was known
all throughout
Tang Dynasty
China
but the
important thing
is to
see in
this
koan
is how
it was
necessary
to turn
that state
of mind
that he
had
and give
rise to
the great
doubt
the great
doubt
is
the Bodhi
mind
in the
beginning
he had
a blindness
that blindness
was the
blindness
of just
not
understanding
the blindness
of not
having
realized
later
under
Master
Ryutan's
careful
guidance
he gave
up that
first kind
of blindness
of delusion
and took
on the
blindness
of
enlightenment
that's
the blindness
of no
eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
and mind
then passing
through that
he again
took up
another
kind of
blindness
and that's
the blindness
of holding
on
to what
he realized
finally
decades
later
when he
reached the
ninth or
tenth stage
and came
down off
the mountain
truly blind
the true
blindness
of no
trace of
enlightenment
remaining
the true
blindness
of the
bodhisattva
who appears
in the
world
not as
a monk
as a
teacher
as a
holy person
but as
an ordinary
being
with all
of the
frailties
of an
ordinary
being
otherwise
there's no
way to
teach
you know
nobody
goes to
study with
superman
or superwoman
how can you
hope to be
like them
you know
look at all
the muscles
you've got
I don't have
those muscles
look how tall
you are
I'm short
how can I
ever be
a superman
I'm too
fat
I'm too
old
the teachers
are always
as the
Buddha was
ordinary
people
it's in
that
ordinariness
that the
extraordinariness
of our
life is
found
it's right
in the
samsara
itself
that it's
found
just like
Toksan
found it
in his
own
pain
and
suffering
that's
the doorway
to
transcend
pain
and
suffering
and that's
why we
say
samsara
is
enlightenment
enlightenment
is
samsara
no you
can talk
about all
the
you know
logical
psychological
stuff that's
going on
here
darkness
emptiness
no eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
mind
candle
light
form
blow it
out
darkness
that's
what happened
who the hell
knows what
happened
and chances
are it'll
never happen
again
there's only
one Toksan
each person
it has to
happen in a
different way
and each
person needs
to clarify
it in a
different way
woman says
far better
seeing the
face than
hearing the
name
then he
says far
better hearing
the name
than seeing
the face
then he
says
though he
saved his
nose
alas he
lost his
eyes
the thing
is is
when you
haven't seen
it
the word
and the
thing
