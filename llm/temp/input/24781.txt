Good afternoon, everybody.
Actually, I do have a great bodhisattva vow.
It's just that this piece of phlegm in my throat won't let me talk, so forget it.
I wanted to talk a little bit today, and I say that literally, about seriousness and silliness in practice.
I recently received a tape from a friend of mine who studies with Daitoshi's Dharma sister, Joko Beck.
Recently, Joko has been kind of appearing in my life from all directions.
Everywhere I turn, somebody's saying something to me that she said or whatever.
So she's been kind of a presence for me of late.
And this tape that arrived really moved me for a number of reasons.
One being that she really took up the dilemma between seriousness and silliness.
She told a very silly story to make a very serious point.
And she, in a sense, by doing so, did something that is kind of a value in Zen practice,
which is destroying that tendency we have towards building this precious, profound Dharma
and forgetting its plainness.
Or vice versa, sticking with the fact that it's all just plain
and losing track of its preciousness and the profoundness of the way.
So what I'd like to do is start by telling this silly story that she shared
and then pull out of it a couple of practice points for us to work with
and also to confess that this talk is a little bit of alphabet soup.
It may or may not spell anything in your bowl, but I offer it.
So Joko tells the story of this large group who lived together in a very large building,
a football stadium-sized, huge space.
And they've lived there since time immemorial.
And it's a very cold building.
And it's so cold.
How cold is it?
It's so cold that all they could think of was getting warm.
And they would light little fires here and there.
But regardless of what they did, it was just cold.
It was drafty.
There was nothing they seemed to be able to do about it.
And because they were never warm, they were never very nice.
They were pretty grumpy.
And sometimes that grumpiness would even inspire things such as stealing a particularly inviting sweater or parka
because warmth was, after all, the top priority.
And this terribly cold and terribly nasty group had been living like this since the beginning of memory.
And the only thing that lightened things up for them at all was that somewhere in the building there was this huge mural of Hawaii.
And they would occasionally go and sit in front of this mural.
And for a little while, they would feel a little better.
Also made this story seem appropriate since Daidoshi and Shugen are in Hawaii, even as we sit.
So they would sit in front of this mural.
Beautiful blue palm trees, birds.
But somehow, after they would leave the mural, they would be even nastier.
And back in the cold.
But it was very important to them, this bright spot, this mural.
And in the building, everyone was assigned a little space of their own.
They had their bed and their dresser up against the wall.
And in the central space in the room was a common area.
And one day, one person, and there's always one, who was a little nosier than the rest,
decided to move his bed away from the wall and see what was behind there.
And this being a story.
No one had ever done that before.
And what do you think he found?
He found a hole in the wall.
And he was fascinated.
He never knew this hole was there.
And he told all his friends about this hole that he had behind his bed.
And, you know, he'd been living in one room since time immemorial.
Anything new is big news.
And so this hole became the talk of the building.
And soon everybody started pulling their bed out from the wall.
And they discovered they all had a hole behind their bed.
And so for years, after this great discovery,
people talked about the nature of these holes.
And out of this evolved, eventually, the Theological Institute for the Study of Holes.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to carry this story to me.
Okay.
So the Theological Institute for the Investigation of Holes.
And it had become a religious pursuit because it was a mystery.
Where did these holes come from?
And why were they there?
What did they have to do with these people's lives?
And the students, the people who live in this building, were earnest.
They applied themselves to this study.
And courses eventually evolved.
Those who were most concerted and earnest.
There was course 1A in round holes.
And course 1B in square holes.
And then there was the science requirement, 1C, black holes.
And then the art students favored the aesthetics of holes.
Whether holes should be all the same size, one higher, one lower.
What's best?
And then the all-important relationship between holes,
their differences and similarities.
This was the psychology requirement.
And of course there was one person among the group who was the most expert,
the most intelligent, the most adept in the study of holes.
And he was the holy man.
This will get Dido back from Hawaii.
One student who was inspired by all the theories
and had learned a great deal about holes
had the novel thought to encounter the hole directly.
The time had come.
History begins now, as the Nazi said.
So one day, in he goes.
These holes were people-sized.
And he found out that all the courses
actually didn't have much to say
about the actual experience of getting in the hole.
The hole was actually pretty dark
and pretty damn scary.
And sometimes all he could think of
as he was struggling along in this mysterious hole
was the mural of Hawaii
and how pleasant it was.
And he couldn't believe
how angry he was
as he went down the hole.
No one had prepared him for this hole.
No one had told him what to expect.
It seemed wrong
that this hole even existed.
And the years of theory that he had
and he could speak eloquently,
eloquently about the emptiness of holes.
But it was nothing like that.
And slowly, he struggled down
this miserable enterprise.
And he began to find things.
Stuck.
Stuck against the wall here and there.
There were his childhood jeans
and sweater that he wore in high school.
And the stuffed animal that he stole
from his sister and never gave back.
He never told her.
Hundreds and hundreds of things
stuck to the dark wall.
The hole was just about blocked
as he proceeded down into it
by all this junk.
And he couldn't even remember
even putting this stuff in the hole.
And he gradually started pulling some of it out
and looking at it
and seeing,
bringing it into the light.
And the weird thing
was that as he'd pull it out
and bring it into the light,
this thick, murky, substantial thing
would become light
and kind of transparent.
Filming.
Kind of beautiful.
And he could put them back in
or he could give them away.
Didn't matter.
And he was very earnest
and he kept at this for years.
It was a very long enterprise in the story.
And as he unblocked the hole,
as these junky things became diaphanies,
a startling thing happened.
Warmth began to come from the hole.
He began to feel the warmth.
And it really began to warm up
all around his space.
And he liked that.
And he put his bed
right in front of the hole then.
And he sat on his bed.
And people would come
and say,
why is it warm here?
They'd say,
well, I've been taking the junk out
and it's getting lighter
and you've got to get in your hole.
That's where the warmth comes from.
And he'd been there
so he could speak directly.
Truth of the hole.
Truth of the mystery.
And the professors all came
to listen
and see what was going on.
And they began going into their holes.
And soon,
except for a few
who really preferred
the Hawaiian mural.
And some of us do.
We just never really warm up.
And slowly,
the body of theory
that had evolved for centuries
and the body of experience
came together.
And something wonderful
began to happen
more and more
as people engaged this process.
The warmth increased
throughout the room.
People began to give back
the stuff that's stolen.
And real harmony
began to be the experience
of this structure.
And yet, in a way,
and this is an important point,
nothing had happened.
They put the stuff
back in the holes.
There was no place
to put it.
But as the heat
poured out
through the channels,
some of the people,
the postgraduate students,
decided they needed to see
where is this warmth coming from?
What's the real source
of this heat?
And so they got back
in the holes.
And they kept going,
emptying the holes out.
And they saw
that you never really
got any more.
That the heat
was just there.
And they accepted,
Joko says,
that their function
was just to keep
the channels open.
And the Theological Institute
for the Study of Holes
did not shut down.
But now it had
a very important new course,
a lab,
field work.
And it began to produce
some very fine students.
And soon the whole
building population
was changed.
and eventually
they even took down
the mural of Hawaii
because they didn't
need it anymore.
And that's the silly story.
So I wanted to look at
some of the stuff
that comes from the hole.
and some of the principles
of practice.
And in order to do that,
I'm going to use
a self-reference
to my own life.
And there are two dangers
in that,
as most of us
are aware.
One is that practice
gets mythologized
easily.
You get hooked
on your own story.
And it's easy
to perceive
a speaker
who does this
as saying
on some level,
let me share with you
how confused
I used to be
and selfish
and how
practice
and even though
in this case
that's true.
I would like
to bow
to the nonsense
of that.
And it also,
in sharing
personal reference,
there's always
the danger too
that it provides
a kind of escape route
for us as students
hearing
because we analyze
the speaker's problem
and see them
very clearly
and the shift
from looking
into our own life
can get lost.
This only usually
comes up big
when there's
some disagreement
or discord
with the teacher
and then you've got
this information
about them.
And so there's
in our practice
a kind of a
koan that goes on
around discretion
versus disclosure
of vulnerabilities
and how those things
can actually serve
or hurt the sangha
because it is so easy
when that disagreement
comes up
where you don't understand
what someone
who's in a teaching
position does
to say,
oh, I know why
they said that to me.
That's because
they have this issue
with their mother,
you know.
So it's dangerous work.
But that doesn't
stop us
any more than phlegm.
So in my own life
I wanted to
look at what
some of this stuff
was.
And it,
for years,
was an issue
for me.
Whenever I would
need to speak,
this blankness
would be there.
I would say
lead a workshop
session.
Nothing to say.
Just do it.
Practice.
Anything else?
And certain
physical tension.
And as I
sat with that
and continue
to work with it,
it
occasionally
would open up
to the reality
of some
of my history.
And those
koans of our
karma,
of what we've
experienced,
are the actual
edge of it.
Although it's
important not to get
lost in the story,
but to actually
place oneself
in the moment.
in my life,
there was
incidents,
but among them,
I remember one
night my mother
had to go pick up
my dad.
He'd been arrested
for driving while
intoxicated.
And they came home
and there was a huge
fight.
and one of the
sticky places
in my mind
was he threw
all the glass
objects in the
house against
the wall,
picking them up
and saying,
do you like this?
Do you want this?
And hurling it
against the wall.
And one of the
objects was this
glass rooster
that's what was
loved.
And as a child,
I would concoct
stories about this
glass rooster.
And so its
destruction in the
angry, violent
way was big.
And then my dad
passed out on the
kitchen floor
amid all this
glass.
And my mother
stormed out.
And I remember
walking through
the kitchen,
trying to pick up
the pieces of the
glass rooster
to glue it back
together.
And the whole
surgings of emotion
you have in a
situation,
the next evening
we go out to
dinner.
And in an
alcoholic family,
one of the things
that happens is
you don't usually
talk about what's
actual.
That's verboten.
And we went out
for tacos.
And I remember
this one distinctly
in which my mother
said, so how was
your day?
And this same
kind of tension
dilemma over
revealing and
discretion, the
dangers around
that, was the
first time I could
place it in my life
physically.
That to say,
wow, I was really
scared.
I just feel like
crying all the time.
I don't know why it
hurts so bad or why
life is so confusing.
And I couldn't say
that, so I gave a
lecture on the Peace
Corps that I was
writing the paper
about.
And my brother
said, oh, she's so
smart.
And my father said,
nothing like having
your 10-year-old
daughter explain
properly.
don't speak the
truth.
Don't say what's
going on.
Don't say it to
your friends.
Don't say it to
your family.
It became a pattern
in my life of
dishonesty.
That I became
very, very well
practiced in not
saying what we
could count to
60 like a
clock for almost
as long as I
wanted.
Years later, I
entered Zen
practice and they
told me to count
my breath.
I remember going
into an initial
doksan and
data saying,
how's it going?
It's great.
I can do this.
Yeah.
I've done this on
my life.
You know, you
want me to be
cheeky doe?
You know?
I don't need a
watch.
And they
believed me.
Part of it
was I'm so well
practiced in
deceit.
And so coming
into this, we've
all got glass
roosters we're
running from in
one way or
another.
One of the
difficulties of
telling a life
story.
But we all
have something
that frightened
us.
There are many
things that
frighten us.
And patterns of
turning away from
what hurts.
And the
revolution of
practice and the
first principle
in my personal
list of pillars
and principles
of Zen is to
stop running
from the
glass rooster.
We face the
fact that
sometimes it's
going to be so
big and so
confusing and so
mysterious and
the hole is right
behind your
bed.
And you
have an
option.
You can
continue to
shut down and
count to
block out life.
Or you can
learn to
return to
the moment.
The moment
that sometimes
has a crash
and sometimes
has a flower.
But the
alternative to
returning is
a lifelong
trip.
A lifelong
sit in front
of that mural
that basically
just makes you
nasty.
So the
raising of
the Bodhi
mind in one
sense is
simply just
for nothing.
My second
principle is
called entering
the dining
hall.
I'm drawn
from my
practice that
involved
not the
work in
Muzendo
which was
relatively
easy to
be silent
to be
still.
Remember
Mizumi Roshi
coming when I
first had
entered training
here in the
first year.
He initially
came quite
frequently.
This is
Daito
Sensei's
teacher.
Partly
continuing to
train his
student and
also to work
with those
of us who
were in the
beginnings of
relationships with
Daito to see
how our training
was going.
And I think
because of my
lifelong habit of
counting I moved
into koan study
very quickly and
proceeded in the
initial koans
relatively rapidly
apparently according
to those who were
watching these things.
and I remember
him saying
you know you
have a real
affinity for
koan study.
And I said
well it's not
the ones in
the Zendo.
It's the
downstairs ones.
And he said
we'll enter
there.
And entering
that dining
hall space.
the place
where the meal
is not
precious anymore.
Where it's
not pretty.
It's just
taking the
food.
It's just
entering the
relationship.
Where the
separation
can arise
with the
slightest
thought.
with the
first idea.
And to
continue to
enter that
is very
specific.
It's like
koan study.
Every koan
is specific.
Which is why
you don't
pass one
and then
go immediately
to
Tozon's
five ranks
usually.
You go
through them
one by one.
And in
a sense
it's the
it's the
to me
the
integrity
of
Zen
training
is
it can
be seen
in
some of
the ways
relationships
are
portrayed.
You look
at the
teacher-student
relationship
the way
we meet
in practice
when meeting
is deep.
you see
the difference
between
what's often
construed as
the Christian
ideal versus
the Buddhist
ideal.
And we
have in
the Buddhist
tradition
the story
of the
Buddha
himself
being met
by
Prajnapati
his step
mother
and
this was
an all
male order
at that
time
Prajnapati
wanted to
enter the
dining room
wanted to
enter the
work
full out
just like
the monks
and
she came
to the
Buddha
and the
Buddha
kind of
just
deferred
walked
away
and so
she
followed
him
she kept
walking
wherever he
walked
and she
was
inspiring
enough
in that
intentionality
and drive
that
a lot
of other
women
saw her
model
and walked
with her
and the
story is
told that
at one
point she
shows up
and the
Buddha in
consultation
with one
of his
seniors
eventually
lets the
women in
with the
statement
this will
put an
end to the
Buddhist
order 500
years before
the time
it would
have otherwise
died
it's a very
important
welcoming
statement
you can
come in
but you'll
probably be
an end
of us
end to
us
what does
that do
you have
the example
in the
movies at
any rate
of the
meeting
between
Claire and
Saint Francis
Saint Claire
is not
familiar
as familiar
to many
of us
as Saint
Francis
when Saint
Francis was
starting
his religious
work
his order
of
practitioners
although
Claire
in fact
of history
was an
incredible
spiritual
being
and
originated
a woman's
order
that
had
integrity
and vigor
and
spiritual
zeal
Amazonian
Christians
in the movie
version
what we get
is Claire
approaching
Francis across
a windswept
field of grass
with their long
hair flowing
and she comes
to him
and in a sense
expresses her vow
please let me
work with you
let me train
I come
not to
be loved
but to
love
and Francis
goes kind of
dewy eyed
and
you know
proceed
and the music
swells
and
there's this
kind of
incumbent
sweetness
that happens
and then
you see Claire
holding bunnies
and lambs
and nursing
the ever grateful
lepers
and
there's not
any indication
of the testing
of that
intention
well you can
enter but
there's no
putting end
to a good
thing quicker
than it would
have otherwise
ended
or
you
do-gooding
white bitch
why do you
think you
can do this
work
we don't
see a scene
of a leper
saying
get your
issue
Zen tradition
is in a sense
the master
of the dining
hall
the real
like
fierce work
the element
of training
that's not
dewy eyed
and sweet
and
grateful
but recognizes
that this is
hard work
this is glass
roosters
and Ika
comes to
Bodhidharma
who has
essentially
been giving
the message
you know
you all are
hopeless
I'm sitting here
facing the wall
I'm going to do it
it's hopeless
to try and teach
again
a challenge
and Ika
comes
and the story
is told
that the snow
is falling
and he stands
outside Bodhidharma's
cave
appealing for
entry
and Bodhidharma
is just
going
and so Ika
stands through
the entire
night
and the snow
is rising
around his legs
and freezing
he's uncomfortable
his life
hurts
and still
Bodhidharma
sits
and by
morning
he's seen
the room
is cold
people are
nasty
life hurts
it's suffering
my life hurts
it's suffering
okay
and Bodhidharma
says to him
the highest
subtle
way of
Buddhism
cannot be
attained
without
immeasurably
long
training
and almost
an unbearable
effort
it can never
be achieved
by puny
virtue
shallow
wisdom
faint
inspiration
or self
conceit
he didn't
turn around
again
the story
continues
and like
the food
that we
offer
during
Oreos
that gesture
of giving
one's life
substance
not
self-preserving
is there
and the snow
on that
shorn
is stained
with that
heart
of practice
and what's
revealed in that
what I call
entering the
dining hall
work
is not about
warm fuzzies
and cold pricklies
as they call
in psychology
not about
holding back
and letting go
as some
exercise
it's about
the challenges
in my practices
