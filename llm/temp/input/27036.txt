And when they did, the monkey just grabbed the arrow and started playing with it.
So obviously it was a kind of a magical monkey.
So the king ordered his whole group of people to shoot it and none of them could hit it.
And then someone suggested that Yu Chi is a good shot.
So he called for Yu Chi and ordered him to shoot the monkey.
And as Yu Chi drew his bow, the monkey immediately hugged the tree and started howling piteously in fear.
And when the arrow was shot, the monkey ran around the back of the tree to avoid it.
But the arrow also went around the back of the tree, circled the tree and hit him and killed him.
Obviously this was the supernatural arrow as it was a supernatural monkey.
So Setsho in his verse said it was exceedingly direct.
If it had been too direct, it wouldn't have hit.
Obviously it would have hit the tree, it wouldn't have hit the monkey.
Since it went around the tree and hit the monkey, why is Setsho calling it exceedingly direct?
And of course a lot of, you know, if you're into intellectual interpretations, there's an immediate relationship.
Encircling the tree, the circle of the national teacher, the circle that Nansen grew on the ground.
Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
No relationship whatsoever.
And that's the problem with linear thought.
It leads you to those kinds of logical conclusions.
And what we're talking about here has nothing to do with logic.
Life doesn't have anything to do with logic.
We call this, there's a koan, we deal with this point in one of our miscellaneous koans.
How do you go straight ahead on a road with a thousand curves?
Same point.
Calling them together, he beckons them, come let's go.
Engel, in commenting, says, a hundred rivers flow separately, but alike return to the great ocean.
That's why Nansen said, then let's not go.
Do you see?
National teacher, Echu, drew the circle, sat in its center, and bowed.
Then, Seccio says, he stops climbing on the road to Soke.
The road to Soke is the road to the home.
Soke is the home of the sixth ancestor.
So, they were on that road going to visit the national teacher.
He stops climbing the road of Soke.
But Seccio also said, the road of Soke is level and even.
Why stop climbing?
Why start climbing?
Engel says, he destroys the forest of thorns.
That road to Soke is not only without thorns, it's without dust, it's trackless, it's open, exposed, naked, clean, level, even, smooth, reaches everywhere.
And at once, it's right under our feet.
Nansen draws the circle.
Nansen draws the circle, immediately making trouble.
Nansen draws the circle.
Nansen draws the circle, immediately making trouble.
Nansen draws the circle, immediately making trouble.
Nansen draws the circle.
Nansen thorns.
Nansen sits in it.
Nansen drinks sake and Kisu gets drunk.
Nansen draws the circle of analytical metal.

source.
Nonsense said,
beautiful, beautiful.
He didn't say beautiful.
He said,
let's not go.
The journey's over.
Let's call it a day.
Okay, so he says,
what an attitude of mine.
The visit
to Uncle Kuroda
is complete.
Anything more,
continuing the journey,
would be
extra,
unnecessary,
redundant.
But forget for a moment
Kisu,
and forget Mayoku,
and tell me,
show me,
where is Nansen?
Nansen?
Show me.
Where are you?
Tangled in the forest of brambles?
What is the forest of brambles?
Nansen?
Immediately,
drawing that circle.
Nansen created
a forest of brambles.
Kisu sitting in the forest of brambles.
Kisu sitting in it
destroyed it.
Mayoku bowing
swept away all the debris.
That's what it means to be the barrier,
to be the corn,
to be the breath.
That's what it means to be the earth.
That's what it means to be intimate
with ourselves
and the universe.
with the Buddha,
the Dharma,
and the Sangha.
That's the iron ox spirit
that reaches everywhere.
that was already there.
