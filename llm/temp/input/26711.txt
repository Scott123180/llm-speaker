When someone becomes a monk here and is ordained, one of the vows that they make is a vow to live a life of simplicity, to practice simplicity.
And this practice of simplicity is not something that's just for the Shinji monk to practice.
It's the practice of every single person in this room, the practice of all the students here at this monastery, the practice of everyone that follows this path.
Today I'd like to explore this bare bones, very direct, nothing in the way practice of simplicity with you all.
Look at it from different points of view, perspectives.
The good old dictionary gives a couple of definitions of this word, and the top of the list definition is lack of complication.
Lack of complication.
The next is clearness, clarity, candor, and finally, plainness in manners or way of life.
Kind of nice.
When I was thinking about this talk, preparing for it, I remembered reading a line out of Daido Sensei's Dharma sister, Joko is her name.
Many of you probably have heard of her, and she teaches in San Diego.
And she wrote a book that was published within this past year called Everyday Zen.
And in the introduction, the editor in the final line of the introduction describes her style, her way of teaching, the kind of person she is.
Very simply, just elegant wisdom in plain clothes.
Again, really nice, just, you see it.
He could have said elegant wisdom in ordinary clothes, unpretentious clothes, simple clothes.
Nothing extra, no adornment, just, just it.
That's it.
And those of us who have been practicing for a while can, at least intellectually, appreciate this teaching of no stench of holiness or enlightenment.
Just ordinary, plain wisdom.
But those of us, when we first enter practice, that's not what we're looking for.
We want to see holiness.
We want to see enlightenment.
We want our ideas of what a realized human being is to be manifested.
We come to a monastery, we've got plenty of ideas.
We've probably read tons of books, heard a lot, and have a lot of expectations of what a Zen teacher should behave like, should act like, should speak like, should teach like.
And if he's, or she's at all a good Zen teacher, they'll probably completely swipe away all of your ideas of what that is, and present just the opposite to you.
And Daido Sensei is that kind of a teacher.
He swipes it all away.
And you come in, and you come in, and you think, and you look for the practice of 24 hours a day gentleness, or a nice guy kind of compassion, and you get just the opposite.
We want to see enlightenment, realization, in some kind of recognizable way that fulfills this idea.
And for that reason, the practice of simplicity is so difficult to perceive at first, so difficult to really appreciate, very hard to practice, very, very hard to manifest.
And why is it so difficult to appreciate, well, we want so badly for realization, that experience, to be something other than what our lives are all about, anyhow, what our lives, our humdrum day-to-day existence is about.
We want it to be firecrackers, and something extraordinary, definitely not something ordinary.
And for many people at this point, coming and not seeing what it is that they're looking for, end up leaving the practice.
And those of us that stay, like you all, like all of us in this room, that's when the real work begins, the real work of having to really look at this mind that's producing all this garbage,
and to really begin to really begin to let go of all of our ideas and opinions about what realization is, about what practice is, about how it looks, how it walks, how it speaks, how it moves, how it responds in a situation.
To have to let go of all of that.
And really, you know, what's essential to this kind of practice is really, deeply being able to really trust yourself.
This is the bottom line.
Without it, it always remains as practice, not our life.
Being able to trust what you say, what you do, how you move, how you respond.
Being able to trust that all of that, who you are, is enough.
And I don't mean enough like good enough, passable, it will do.
But enough as in, who I am, who you are, is complete, is perfect, lacking nothing.
We hear it all the time.
Trusting that we don't need to adorn ourselves.
Don't need to make more of ourselves.
And we do it constantly.
We want to sound intelligent.
We want to sound like we're wise.
We want to sound compassionate.
We want to sound and be a lot of things.
And all those things are fine.
It's the wanting that gets in the way of just being all those things.
So trusting yourself is so critical in this practice of things, letting things be just as they are.
Simplicity.
Things just as they are.
You and I, just as we are.
We don't need to add, as Daito says, another head on top of the one we already have.
Or it's like, you know, being a size 10 and trying to squeeze yourself into a size 8 pair of pants or something.
As if size 10 isn't good enough.
You are who you are, what you are.
And that's fine.
Just, just that.
So it really takes such utter honesty.
And that honesty begins in Zazen.
It begins every time a thought comes up.
And we tell everyone that walks through the gate, comes into the monastery, and receives beginning instruction for the first time.
What do you do when a thought comes up?
The very first thing you do is to see the thought we say.
To really look at the thought.
To take complete responsibility for this mind that produced that thought.
That's where the honesty begins, right there.
Not trying to deny the thought.
Not trying to alter or change it.
But accepting it, owning it.
Whether you like it or not.
Whether it makes you feel good about yourself or not.
Just to see.
It.
Plain.
Simple.
Just to see that.
Giving ourselves permission to see and be seen by everything and everyone.
That's scary, you know.
That's a scary kind of practice to really do that.
To really make yourself completely naked.
And we do this a lot as Sangha.
And it gets tested constantly with each other.
In all kinds of situations.
Bumping up against each other.
Being revealed in front of each other.
Feeling like a jerk in front of each other.
Feeling cocky and proud.
To simply be yourself.
Mind is such a bizarre thing.
It remembers such odd memories.
I don't know why I remember this one.
But I can't remember whether it was a television interview.
Or I read it somewhere.
A long time ago.
But the person was interviewing Catherine Hepburn.
Kate.
The actress.
And the interviewer was asking her just questions about her life.
What it was like.
What it's been like to be the kind of actress that she's been.
And at some point.
I'm probably getting this all mixed up.
But I think I got the spirit of the interview down.
She said.
Well.
You know what I'm kind of like.
In that flamboyant voice that she has.
I'm like an exotic bird.
And.
The interviewer said.
Well.
How would you compare.
What would you.
Describe.
Spencer Tracy.
Like.
And.
And they were.
I guess.
Lovers for many years.
And.
Without hesitation.
She said.
Ah.
Spencer.
She said.
I'm so envious.
He.
He's always been that.
Just down to earth.
Idaho.
Potato.
Through and through.
And.
Just so unpretentious.
Simple.
Just who he was.
But what she didn't see was.
Just who she was.
An exotic bird.
Was simple.
And beautiful.
And direct.
And perfect.
And lacking nothing as well.
But.
We can see what she was communicating.
Was just.
Just nothing in the way.
You know.
Just.
Not trying to pretend to be.
Some exotic anything.
But.
An Idaho potato.
Through and through.
As I was thinking about.
Art.
And artists.
And.
I.
Obviously.
Thought about the Zen arts.
And how.
That's a constant teaching.
In the Zen arts.
Is.
Simplicity.
We see it.
A lot.
In.
Brush paintings.
That just bold.
Slice of black against.
Space of white.
Nothing adorned.
Just.
Just that.
What does it mean?
Who the hell cares what it means?
It's.
Doesn't mean anything.
It's.
Just that.
We see it in flower arrangements.
Zen flower arrangements.
The simplicity of.
Not.
50 carnations.
And a bunch of baby's breath.
All around it.
Who can see anything.
Just a few flowers.
Sprigs.
A little bit of green.
A branch.
Going off to the side.
A lot of space around it.
So that what you experience.
Is just.
Flower.
Nothing else.
Nothing extra.
Uh.
We read it.
In haiku.
And.
Most of you are probably familiar with.
You know.
Great Master Basho.
And.
His.
Famous.
Poem.
Uh.
How's it go?
I have to read this.
The old pond.
Ah.
A frog jumps in.
The water's sound.
That's it.
And immediately.
You see.
And you hear.
That.
Moment.
Nothing extra.
Nothing fancy.
You don't have to have a PhD.
Or travel around the world.
Or make tons of money.
Or anything.
To.
Read that.
And experience it.
Deeply.
Just.
And simply.
What that's.
Expressing.
When I was growing up.
Training.
In.
In dance.
One of the ways that.
In any profession.
That.
Training happens.
Is.
When stories are passed down.
From one generation.
To another.
And one of the stories that I heard.
Constantly.
And then heard later on.
Uh.
When I was older.
Was.
The story of Isadora Duncan.
And.
Those of you.
I'm sure.
Have.
Heard.
At least the name.
Isadora Duncan.
She was the.
Pioneer.
Of.
Modern dance.
And.
Dance.
In Europe.
And America.
Up to this point.
Had been ballet.
Toe shoes.
Transcending.
Leaving the earth.
Kind of feeling.
Um.
And she.
Was.
Such a rebel.
She.
Threw off the toe shoes.
Let her hair down.
Put on these.
Outrageous.
See through.
Greek tunics.
With.
Nothing else.
Underneath.
Uh.
Not.
A svelte.
Ballerina body.
But a woman.
You know.
A woman underneath.
Um.
And.
Just raised hell.
All over Europe.
And America.
This is.
You know.
Turned the century.
Uh.
Just.
Anything goes.
Movement.
Um.
And the story.
That I heard.
Quite a bit.
And then I read.
A lot about.
Later on.
Was.
How.
So many people.
That had seen her.
Spoke of this one moment.
In a performance.
And it's the same moment.
That was.
Recalled.
Countless times.
This moment where she's.
Simply.
Still.
On stage.
Standing.
All alone.
And she's just.
Standing there.
Complete presence.
It's simple.
Nothing's going on.
And suddenly.
Her arms begin to raise.
Both arms.
Up into the air like this.
And.
I'm not Isadora Duncan.
So.
It's not going to happen here.
But.
Believe me.
When that happened.
Uh.
It said that.
People.
Just.
Wept.
At.
These arms.
Raising into the air.
And again.
What's the meaning of that?
So.
Powerful.
And everyone said.
They wept.
It was just.
Such a sight.
To behold.
The simplicity.
Of a single gesture like that.
And you could say that about.
You know.
Looking at a sunset.
What's the meaning of a sunset?
It's just.
It's just.
You know.
When you're all alone outside.
And you're lying on your back on the grass.
And you're watching the clouds go overhead.
What's the meaning of that?
It's just.
Wow.
You know.
Or a bird flying.
What's the teaching in that?
Is the bird watching itself fly?
Hell no.
It's just.
It's just flying.
It's just doing its thing.
No hindrance.
Being.
Who it is.
Through and through.
So simply.
So deeply.
Nothing in the way.
No hindrance.
The power.
In a single gesture.
The power.
In that brush stroke.
The power.
In.
Someone.
Completely unrestrained.
No self.
The self is forgotten.
And.
The person just comes up.
And gives you this enormous hug.
Why?
Who the hell cares?
It's just.
You know.
That.
Kind of.
Love.
When.
You don't feel like you have to.
Well.
I love you because.
And.
And because of this.
And because.
No.
I love you.
Just.
That.
So simple.
It doesn't have to do anymore.
It doesn't have to say anymore.
It doesn't have to be anymore.
It's just so direct.
Ah.
You know.
Or Lobo.
You see Lobo.
It's like.
You know.
He can't be contained.
That kind of aliveness.
Ah.
Expression.
That's so direct.
You know.
It's.
The reason I was thinking about that hug.
I was thinking about Ryushin.
Let me tell you.
He gives quite a hug.
And it's completely unrestrained.
It's just.
You know.
And.
And we all have that ability.
Capability.
When you just forget yourself for a moment.
And you just express.
Exactly where you are.
And how you're feeling.
It comes out.
And it's wonderful.
Simplicity of nature.
It's kind of redundant in a way.
You know.
Nature is just what it is.
Simplicity is saying that.
Things just as they are.
In this past week.
I had the opportunity to.
Take some time off the schedule.
And.
One of the students here.
That practices here.
Is.
Probably many of you know him.
His name is Clark Sanders.
And he lives about an hour and a half away from here.
In a little town.
Called Meredith.
Meredith New York.
And it's.
So beautiful out there.
You know.
Just.
These rolling hills.
And just farm country.
Absolute farm country.
And they all look like it's still family owned.
And.
These just beautiful meadows and pastures.
And cows.
Crossing dirt roads.
And big open blue sky.
Clouds rolling overhead.
Beautiful.
And he built on this property of his.
A small kind of retreat space.
A hermitage.
Which one small building is like a zendo.
Meditation hall.
And the other is kind of a sleeping space.
And eating space.
So I had a chance to be there.
For the week.
And sit sazen.
And work outside.
And just be outside.
And I was kind of hesitating.
Telling a story about this.
Because it's kind of embarrassing.
I figure hey.
See and be seen.
So.
I'll let you see me.
Um.
It's.
It's good.
It's good practice.
Um.
I guess it was maybe the second night there.
And I have to.
I have to kind of lay out this whole thing for you.
Uh.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Not we're.
I'm in the middle of nowhere.
No one's with me.
I'm completely alone.
And those of you who've done like solo camping.
Or whatever.
Uh.
Probably think.
What's the big deal here?
You know.
Or at least can I identify with some of my terror.
So.
Here we are.
Here I am.
The second night.
And uh.
I decide to go in to sit.
Evening Sazen.
And this example that I'm sharing with you is kind of an example of the mind doing just
the opposite of simple practice.
Taking something and running with it.
Like we always do in Sazen.
And suddenly one thought or a sound leads to another.
And suddenly it's this huge scenario.
And we're miles away from where we are.
Well that's what happened.
There I am.
And I'm doing Sazen.
And everything's fine.
And.
Oh by the way.
There's no electricity.
There.
Everything is lit by oil lamps.
There's no telephone.
There's no form of transportation.
There are a lot of very odd sounds outside.
A lot of kind of spooky sounds.
And I think to myself.
This is really ridiculous.
Come on.
You should be able to deal with this.
This is not scary.
This is not scary.
No.
I'm not scared.
So I'm sitting there.
And suddenly it sounds like.
You know that kind of crunchy cellophane.
When it like.
When you do this to it.
It was like that.
And suddenly hearing this.
I'm like.
Okay.
All right.
Natural cellophane.
Down to earth cellophane.
Okay.
I can let go of this.
This is just a sound.
This is not scary.
I'll have called it.
Ha ha.
Right.
More like pushing it away.
Good example of suppression.
Okay.
So I'm pushing it away.
And it comes back.
The thought.
Plus the sound.
It doesn't stop.
It persists.
And then suddenly the sound changes.
And it sounds like.
Something is dragging something else across the gravel.
Oh wonderful.
I'm sitting there.
And I'm still in my.
You know.
The posture.
I've maintained the posture at least.
Right.
But the mind is going.
It's taking this simple little sound.
And gone with it.
Crazy.
And suddenly I'm telling myself.
Okay.
It's probably some kind of vicious animal.
Or it could be a vicious human being.
And by the way.
This room.
This is huge window.
Glass window.
Huge.
I'm thinking.
I'm sitting here quietly.
And I'm going to die.
This thing.
Whatever it is.
Is going to crash through the glass.
And eat me alive.
There's no telephone.
There's no form of escape.
I can run fast though.
And so I'm doing this thing.
It's absurd.
It's a single sound.
Crunchy little sound.
And I'm gone.
You know.
I didn't sleep very well that night.
So you can see I didn't let go of it either.
And it kind of lingered with me for the week.
Every time I hear a sound.
I was like.
Okay.
So at one point I decided.
All right.
I'm going to outfox whatever this is.
So the window's over there.
And I slowly turn.
And look at it.
Like what's that going to do?
What's it going to do?
It's not going to do anything.
Whatever it is.
It can see me.
I can't see it.
It's dark outside.
Well anyhow.
That was my example.
Not very good practice.
You know.
And some people could say.
Well.
Hey.
If it was danger.
Then you know.
That was appropriate.
Right?
Well only appropriate if you get up.
And you check it out.
You check it out.
You don't just sit there and.
Check it out.
And see what's happening.
And then you know.
If everything's okay.
Then you come back.
And you let it go.
And you continue doing what you're doing.
But no.
I didn't do that.
Anyhow.
The week was really wonderful though.
For really experiencing that bare bones just down to earth kind of things just as they are.
You know.
Being outside and feeling like that child that's two years old and looking up at the sky and seeing these really incredible cloud formations.
But the child doesn't know the word cloud formations.
Doesn't know the word moving.
Doesn't know any word.
Just experiencing these things.
Passing overhead.
You know.
Sitting in the knowless meadow.
And feeling like I'm at the ocean.
And this tall grass is this high.
These incredible winds.
Just.
You know.
If I had hair.
It would go back.
It was like that.
Just experiencing that.
You know.
You're thinking why.
Why isn't it always just that simple.
Why do I make it so complicated.
Why do I make my life so complicated.
Why do we do that.
How do we constantly get in the way.
And.
Where does that simplicity begin.
You know.
It begins with the mind.
It begins with.
Zazen.
It starts right where.
Each one of us sits and stands.
This entire week.
You know.
We have an opportunity.
Moment to moment to moment.
To practice that.
Getting out of the way.
And really just.
Being with.
What's right in front of us.
Simply.
Not turning it into.
More than what it is.
And letting that be.
Just what that is.
And letting you.
Yourself.
Be.
Just who you are.
Don't need to.
Adorn.
Adorn.
Adorn.
Just.
You know.
When it's.
Basho.
It's just.
This.
When it's bowing.
It's just bowing.
When you're eating.
Just.
Eating.
Just.
Washing the dishes.
Just sitting.
Zazen.
And that sound that comes up.
You see it.
And you let it go.
Or you take care of it.
And then you let it go.
You don't run with it.
Like I did.
Um.
Um.
Um.
But to really.
Taste.
Each.
Moment.
Of this weekend.
We've just begun.
You know.
And what a wonderful opportunity.
For it to be.
A students only.
Session.
And for those of you.
Who.
Aren't formal students.
But are here in residency.
You're practicing like students.
You have the mind of.
Of a student.
That kind of commitment.
Or you wouldn't be here.
And to have that all.
Working together.
To have each of us.
Supporting.
That.
Commitment.
That practice.
Of just.
Utter.
Simplicity.
Letting things.
Just be.
What they are.
Just.
Pure seeing.
Pure tasting.
Smelling.
Touching.
Loving.
Being alive.
So let's do that.
Let's do that.
Let's do that.
