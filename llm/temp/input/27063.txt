Thank you.
God has true meaning.
So welcome to part two of the three pillars of practice.
Today we're going to do the great faith koan.
And I wanted first to read from the Faith Mind Sutra, the beginning lines.
The great way is not difficult.
It only avoids picking and choosing.
When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised.
Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.
If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinion for or against anything.
To set up what you like against what you dislike is a disease of the mind.
When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
The way is perfect like vast space, where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.
Indeed, it's due to our choosing to accept or reject that we don't see the true nature of things.
Live neither in the entanglements of outer things nor in inner feelings of emptiness.
Be serene in the oneness of things, and such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.
To deny the reality of things is to miss their reality.
To assert the emptiness of things is to miss their reality.
The more you talk and think about it, the farther astray you wander from the truth.
Stop talking and thinking, and there's nothing that you'll not be able to know.
And on that note, I'm going to talk about it for a while.
When we decided to do this series that Daito was going to be gone for three days,
and there were three of us doing the session, and we'd do the three pillars of practice,
as Yasutani Roshi outlined, no one jumped at great faith.
I think there's a kind of quiet quality to great faith,
whereas great doubt has this kind of cavernous, screaming drama to it.
And at least to me, great determination is kind of this fang-toothed, bloody-eyed,
I'll-do-it-dammit, you know, fierceness.
Whereas great faith has kind of this fluffy pillar quality to it.
And I thought it would be a good challenge for me
to kind of go into that and see what's there that I've not appreciated before.
In a sense, it is so intimate, and we use that word so much that it tends to get lost in our hearts.
But it is so close that faith is almost impossible to talk about.
And because of that, I'm going to tell a fish story.
It's one of the ancient teaching stories,
and it always seemed very much like Zen training at this monastery to me,
because there's this young, very philosophical fish
who turns to another fish in philosophy class and says,
you know, I hear so much about this water, this ocean that we live in,
this, I guess it's kind of their ground of being, their water of being.
I would love to meet this water, know this ocean.
And the other philosophical fish go, oh, yes, that would be very interesting.
And they go to the old sage, Tuna Fish, who says to them,
we are all of one ocean.
There is no other ocean than this.
We are born ocean.
We live ocean.
We die ocean.
And the fish, the young philosophical fish,
now have a philosophy to go with,
and they have faith in it, and they believe it.
And this is a lot like the talking Zen
that we all get into in the first few years of Zen training.
We can say it all and believe it beautifully,
because it's nice.
We are all of one water.
We are all of the same stuff,
different yet the same.
And on occasions when we're pressed to say what we believe,
we may come out with this kind of stuff.
Well, there's no self.
All things are one.
And, you know, and you do your Zen rap.
And this is fish faith and not great faith.
And the only place I've ever seen great faith at all done visually
was in the New Yorker cartoon that Sensei's spoken of many times,
in which, I don't know if they're the same fish or different fish,
but there are two fish leaping out of the water.
And one turns to the other and says,
see, that's what I was telling you about.
And this reminds me of an expression of Dogen's
that he uses very frequently and very vibrantly,
which is emptiness leaping out of itself.
And it kind of embodies that intrinsic contradiction
of how can you see yourself?
You're the one doing the seeing.
And in the sutra that I just read,
I encountered that same kind of dilemma
on the part of the translators.
And it was interesting to see
how different ones of them dealt with it.
The whole sutra is about non-duality.
That's its point, if there is a point.
It expressed itself even in the title.
Some of the translators would call it
the Faith in Mind Sutra,
which is a definite interpretation.
Others would call it the Faith Mind Sutra.
They couldn't take it apart.
But when you look at that Faith in Mind for just a moment,
you encounter that same kind of
what's-going-on-here feeling
to just ask,
whose faith?
In whose mind?
If it's mind's faith in mind,
then it has a kind of internal redundancy.
And what's going on there?
What does it mean
to see into your own nature,
to see into your own mind?
And it's very difficult to talk about it.
It requires a leap of a sort.
And that's Dogen's leaping out of oneself,
out of emptiness.
It is impossible.
And that's our job.
But this is all kind of airy talk.
I know that,
as I see many of you fade away
as I start talking about internal contradictions.
And that's not what this talk will be about.
For me, it started coming up,
it's more the grit bones
of the great faith koan
that Daito-shi earlier in the week
was talking about
when he was saying,
you know,
I say,
practice with your whole body and mind
and it
becomes abstruse to people.
What I mean is practice
with your life,
with your
junk,
with your stuff,
with what's going on for you.
And it occurred to me
that the
grit bones,
great faith koan
is one I've heard expressed
so many times
and done myself
over and over
and over again.
And it goes something like,
if
the instruction
is to trust myself,
that's my resource.
It's to constantly be thrown back on myself.
And myself
is this deluded,
stupid,
selfish,
weird thing.
How will I ever
find this great way
that's beyond picking and choosing?
It doesn't,
I don't,
what do I,
and you get into
that.
And you find that
you're constantly questioning,
like Gion was saying yesterday,
the kind of the source
of your own motivation,
the source of your own actions,
what's underneath,
the underneath,
the underneath,
of why you do,
what you do,
when you do,
how you do.
And it's very easy
to become stymied.
And the
leap
practice
becomes necessary.
Because it's not
about knowing.
And it's not something
that can be figured out.
And if you go
to the Zen master,
if that's your
avenue of resources,
and you do this
great faith koan
in front of him,
and you say,
I don't understand
how to do it.
What,
what,
you know,
I don't have what it takes.
I,
my life is so confused.
I'm not very smart.
I'm not really a,
kind of a spiritual whiz kid.
And I don't understand
your dharma talks.
I don't,
I,
you know,
I,
I really feel lost.
And
he'll,
in the midst of your drama,
say,
trust yourself.
Which starts you again
with,
what do you mean,
trust myself?
Myself,
you told me,
didn't exist.
And
here you are,
I'm supposed to trust it.
And you get in this loop.
And it's very dramatic
and very painful.
And it recurs
periodically.
And it's basically
coming from the same point
that this sutra started with
of no choice,
no picking and choosing.
How do you get out of the loop
of picking and choosing?
And the monk
who long ago
asked that of Joshu
experienced a kind of leap
that is interesting
to look at
when he said
to his teacher,
what is it to not pick or choose?
How do you get outside a choice?
How do you
really make that leap?
And Joshu said,
between heaven and earth,
I alone
am the Holy One.
he swallowed it all up.
It was just
him.
Nothing outside.
He could only
nod to himself,
as the phrase goes.
It was no,
it was no one else's problem,
as Sensei said
the other day
in his talk.
But the monk
didn't leap with him.
Stood outside of it.
And from
standing outside of it,
that's choosing.
And so the monk says,
well that's a choice.
That was,
you just chose
to say
I alone.
I mean,
what do you mean?
That's choosing.
And Joshu turns to him
and says,
asshole,
where's the picking
and choosing?
Where's the choice?
He flips it around.
He says,
I'm both
one,
alone
between heaven and earth,
and I'm duality.
You're over there,
you're an asshole.
And he does it
to shock,
to shake the monk up.
That switching
back and forth,
that ability
to walk
in both sides
at once,
is a place
of freedom
that only comes
through that
deep faith.
I'm not going
to go
in any great depth
into the koan.
It's only
given as an example
of the frequency
of the question
and the way
that the response
can reveal
the way
out of that loop.
How do you
get out of the loop?
of this and that,
of up and down,
of me and you,
of I don't know
what to do.
It's all so complicated
and I am not enough
to choose.
I alone,
I'm the only one.
It all comes back
to this spot.
And in this spot,
in this one place
that contains everything,
it also contains
choice.
It's neither choice
nor not choice.
But that can get
very intellectual.
The question is
how to do it,
how to begin
to even
deal
with the question.
And that's what
we usually
carry in
or carry around
when we're in
that muddle
of great doubt
and the great faith
that arises
with it.
And that's
something that
I think often
goes unrecognized.
I know on,
on my part,
when I came
into training,
I was very
conscious of
doubt.
That
fanged place
was the way
I walked around.
I didn't understand.
I was
angry is not
the word.
but very
much aware
that things
were not
working.
Not so aware
that just
the fact
of deciding
to practice
was an act
of great faith,
was a leap
that made
all the difference
in the world.
The
rareness
of that
in the world
is something
that I
think we
also need
to appreciate
among
those who
make the
commitment
to practice
so that we
can appreciate
one another
better.
There's a
phrase in
Dogen's
writings where
he's talking
about
the necessities
for those
who will
receive a
monastic
education
similar to
the three
pillars of
faith.
but he
says that
the first
one is
that those
who have
the thought
of enlightenment,
those who've
allowed it
to come
up,
come forward,
and when
there's that,
regardless of
intellectual ability
or anything
else,
there's
the possible
probability
of authentic
practice,
just the
thought,
just the
fact that
it comes
up is
enough,
contains
the whole
spectrum of
what practice
can be,
of what
enlightenment
can be.
And that
was very
moving to
me because
it was much
easier for me
to admit that
I could have
that thought
than it
was to
imagine
possibly being
able to
do something
called attain
realization,
which didn't
make much
sense,
considering my
limited resources.
It also,
in his
requirements,
mentions the
necessity
that those
who undertake
monastic
education or
Zen training
have the
willingness
to let
go of
personal
satisfactions
in order to
serve others,
which was
something I'd
never seen
phrased before
in Zen.
It sounded
more like a
Christian ideal
in some way,
and yet it
was also very
obvious when
you looked at
what a Zen
student does
in terms of
letting themselves
be made
uncomfortable,
whether you
call it
serving others
or serving
yourself and
getting yourself
out of misery.
There's
inevitably an
element of
service intrinsic
to it,
that you're not
simply eating,
sleeping,
and drinking
your way to
death.
There's a
movement,
a direction
towards freedom
and that
movement
can eventually
become a
vow,
and that
vow,
which is so
evident here,
is enough
to break
open the
sky.
It
began to
occur to me
when I was
kind of
letting deep
faith
mull around
in my
horror as
a talk
topic that
one of the
things that
many of us
share is
an intolerance
or a
dislike for
that kind
of fish
faith or
the false
faith that
is very
prevalent in
the world.
it is
very
difficult
to
describe
the
difference
between
someone who
is really
living out
of deep
faith and
one who's
not.
It was
obvious to
me recently
in
Arlington
when I
went to
my dad's
funeral.
and there
was a
wonderful
ceremony
going on.
An
honor
guard
firing
guns and
folding
flags and
doing all
of this
fal-de-rah
ritual which
was very
powerful.
It
came to
a point
in the
ceremony
where
the
base
chaplain
was to
speak
and
he had
on all
the
religious
stuff,
the white
gloves and
the uniform
and the
shiny shoes
and the
band across
his chest
and he
read from
the Bible
and he
read beautiful
words.
It was
very much
about letting
go and
a teaching
and leading
a good
life.
But in
his eyes
and in
his presence
you could
feel nothing
but fear
and discomfort
and I
felt so
sad for
him to
have this
job where
day after
day,
hour after
hour,
people came
in states
of grief
and turned
to him
and he
was
frightened.
And I
wasn't going
to talk
about this
but I
guess because
I've brought
it up,
I'll mention
because so
many of the
sangha did
reach out
to me
when my
dad died
that one
of the
things that
was most
surprising to
me about
this period
of time
was the
intensity of
the emotion
that I
felt and
I mentioned
it to
Dido that
I didn't
think I
would feel
so much
and I
guess I
thought seven
years of
training and
letting go,
it would
just go.
And he
said,
well,
it's loss
in a great
chunk.
It's a
big change.
And I
said,
yeah,
it's not
so much
even sadness
as what
I might
call just
an intensity
of remembering
where something
will strike
a chord
and what
I call
my dad
will be
so present
that I'll
just be
full of
appreciation,
I guess
appreciation
would be a
word for it.
and I
asked him
because his
mom died
a year
ago
whether that
feeling
continued
or
did he
have that
and he
said that
he would
forget
and that
occasionally
something would
come up,
the hardback
books that
we ordered
for Shinzon
Shiki came
in and he
was making
a list of
who to send
one to
and he put
his mom's
name on
the list
and suddenly
remembered
and the
feeling was
there.
and it
was wonderful
to me to
feel not
only my
own emotion
there but
also in him
that it
wasn't
indeed
some kind
of
leveling off
of passion
that comes
with practice
but a real
presence of
passion that
is part of
what we
enable ourselves
to do.
It was
really nice.
It was also
surprising
and wonderful
to not have
the degree
of confusion
that I'd
always associated
with death
that
as
at least
for me
what brought
me into
a spiritual
practice years
and years
ago
was the
kind of
mystery
around death
and a
great deal
of anxiety
associated
with that
and to
simply be
able to
feel
loss
without that
confusion
was a
wonderful
gift
I think
of practice
but I'd
like to
express
my
thanks
to all
of you
who
were there
for me
next thing
I have to
say is
funny
I need
to
transition
the
thing I was
going to
move on
to here
was
that
one of
the things
that for
me was
very important
about Zen
when I first
came in
and that
confused the
hell out of
my friends
when I came
up here
was that
Zen began
with life
is suffering
and they
would sit
me down
the people
who were
in the
meditation
group
that I'd
been in
previously
and say
listen
this sounds
like a
real downer
these people
have lost
track of joy
and lost
track of all
these things
and I said
but don't
you have to
acknowledge that
and to me
the story
of the Buddha
was very
visual
in my head
and I'll
confess to
what it
looked like
there's
the story
of where
he leaves
the enclave
of his
father's
castle
or whatever
it was
having led
a very
protected
life
and goes
out
and discovers
all this
crap in
the world
and to me
he was a
young Rockefeller
who went
out to his
limousine
and he has
a black
driver
and they
go
down into
the low
areas of
New York
and he
sees like
a bag
lady
it's like
throwing up
a night
of bourbon
into the
gutter
and says
what is
going on
what is
wrong
with that
woman
and the
cab driver
turns to him
and says
hey shit
happens
it's like the
bumper sticker
shit happens
and they
continue on
the ride
and there
are people
dying in
the streets
and there
are people
growing old
and the cab
driver is just
this very
blithe
shit happens
and this
became
kind of
the
seed
root
of
Buddhist
teaching
and the
honesty
of that
is something
that at least
for me was
necessary
you know it's
like
you can't
have grown up
with the
Vietnam War
having dinner
with you
and deny
these things
I don't
know
what it
took
pre-TV
for the
image
and the
reality
and the
palpability
of pain
to become
there
but
it
is something
that
in it
this time
is undeniable
and I think
a religion
or a
practice
has to
very directly
grip that
from the
very start
so
shit
happens
and the
way
that it's
dealt
with
the
problem
I'm sorry
I'm a little
distracted
I shouldn't
have
talked about
my dad's
dying
so quickly
the way
that it's
dealt
with
in
Buddha's
teaching
goes right
to the
eightfold
path
he identifies
that shit
happens
he looks
at why
it happens
and he
looks at
how to
clean it
up
and if
you look
very carefully
at the
eightfold
path
the way
it's
cleaned
up
is
basically
great
faith
the
eightfold
path
uses the
word
right
to mean
complete
or total
right
understanding
right
thought
speech
action
livelihood
effort
mindfulness
concentration
and all
of them
basically
spring
from that
leap
there's
no reason
behind it
there's
no justification
for it
it leaps
what Dogen
talks about
when he
tries to
communicate
the point
to his
monks
is the
total
exertion
of a
single
Dharma
position
which is
a kind
of fancy
way
to say
do it
do it
now
do it
here
don't
question
it
don't
divide it
into 57
different
varieties
of ways
to do
it
just do
it
in my
Jikai
class
when
I was
receiving
the
precepts
Dado
Sensei
once
held up
this
ball
that he
had
for some
reason
sitting
in the
room
I think
it was
for the
dog
and we
were
questioning
really
how to
practice
this
eightfold
path
and he
held up
the ball
and said
how do
you drop
a ball
and we
you know
all scrutinized
the situation
very carefully
and he
drops the
ball
in front
of our
face
after we
delayed
the
situation
five or
ten
seconds
and basically
that's the
action
and the
simplicity
of great
faith
it's
just
doing
it
it's
just
being
move
it's
just
like the
sutra
said
avoiding
picking
and choosing
not trying
to figure
out how
not trying
to figure
out why
just doing
it
just
doing
it
there's
a
when
when
yasatani
roshi
first
talked
about
these
pillars
of
faith
he
did
his
number
on
faith
itself
three
pillars
of
practice
he did
his
number
on
faith
and
one
of
the
students
in
the
room
said
so
basically
great
faith
is
just
believing
like
everything
as it
is
is
Buddha
nature
right
like
the
willow
is
green
and
the
carnation
is
red
and
you're
tall
and
I'm
small
right
and
yasatani
said
yeah
he explained
he didn't
really present
an answer
to her
but he did
come back
and he said
you know
isn't that
absurd
isn't the
fallacy
of that
self-evident
if you
don't
in that
faith
also
question
why
is
there
greed
why
is
there
conflict
if
all
things
are
perfect
and
complete
lacking
nothing
why
is
there
conflict
how
does
that
arise
and
that
faith
and
doubt
working
together
you
don't
ask
the
question
if
you
don't
somehow
feel
there
is a
question
you
just
accept
shit
happens
and
that's
the way
it's
supposed
to
be
and
I'm
part
of
it
and
so
I'm
shit
and
forget
it
and
you
may
curl
up
in
a
ball
or
you
may
create
more
of
it
if
there's
anything
subtly
operating
that
tells
you
there's
another
way
to
live
then
great
faith
is
operating
and
that's
kind
of
the
mutual
co-arising
of the
two
together
the
thing
that
Mizumi
Roshi
said
about
great
faith
that I
liked
was
that
great
faith
functions
as a
steering
wheel
for
determination
that
if
you
simply
let
determination
be
the foot
on the
gas
pedal
you
just
go
all
over
the
place
banging
into
things
unless
there's
some
sensibility
that what
this is
about
is
enlightenment
and that
that informs
the beginning
of your
practice
then
it just
bangs
around
what I
see
this
breakdown
into
in the
zendo
and in
our
training
is
basically
a sense
of
courage
and
attentiveness
that
every
moment
is
important
and
every
moment
is the
koan
so that
regardless
of
what's
coming
up
whether
your
knee
is
breaking
or
your
koan
is
stupid
or
the
windows
open
and
your
neck
is
cold
it's
your
life
and
that
faith
empowers
what you
do
it
is
your
koan
it
comes
home
to
you
one
of
the
problems
with
fish
faith
or
the
kind
of
fluffy
faith
is
that
it
leaves
you
the
option
to
say
if
my
life
were
different
then
I
would
practice
if
I
only
had
a
better
body
and
that
didn't
keep
breaking
if
I
only
lived
in
a
warmer
climate
then
I
would
really
sit
strong
great
faith
kind
of
swallows
that
up
and
it's
a
very
simple
ordinary
thing
we
often
rebel
against
the
word
faith
because
it
sounds
kind
of
special
and
very
religious
and
I've
heard
examples
given
of
well
you
have
faith
in
turning
on
the
electric
switch
that
the
light
will
come
on
you
don't
think
about
it
you
just
do
it
and
in
a
very
simplified
slightly
off
way
that's
the
action
of
great
faith
but
it's
more
subtle
than
that
and
we
all
know
that
because
it
takes
that
very
minute
giving
to
your
practice
of
everything
of
the
pain
and
the
joy
else
elsewhere
in the
faith
mind
sutra
so
zan
says
to
live
in
this
faith
is
the
road
to
the
non
dual
because
the
non
dual
is
one
with
a
trusting
mind
let's
this
last
evening
of
session
explore
that
trusting
mind
together
when you
trust
yourself
when I
trust
myself
that
swallows
the whole
universe
that is
standing
alone
whether we
realize it
or not
trusting the
moment
trusting our
practice
I don't
have any
magic up
here
I don't
even have
much
force
today
and I
apologize
for that
but I
do have
great
faith
that
together
with
this
trusting
mind
the
Buddha
way
and our
lives
can't be
split
apart
I
think
that I
shouldn't
talk much
more
but I'd
like
to
encourage
everyone
here
to use
this last
bit of
time
to really
trust it
one of
the things
we tend
to do
on the
last
day
is
vacillate
between
feeling
I'm
really
going to
eke
everything
out of
this
time
nothing
will
stop
me
and
seeing
well
it's
almost
over
I'll
go to
bed
early
it's
a real
important
time
to
trust
your
capabilities
there's
nothing
any of
us
lacks
if it
were
a party
after a
long
hard
week
none
of us
would
bat an
eye
if it
were a
good
party
to stay
up till
one or
two in
the
morning
we'd
enjoy
it
we'd
take
it
as
our
right
our
payoff
this
night
is
the
party
and we
can do
it
we can
go
so
deep
into
ourselves
on this
last
day
please
let's
trust
each
other
and
what
we
can
do
thank you
to
you
you
you
you
you
you
Oh
