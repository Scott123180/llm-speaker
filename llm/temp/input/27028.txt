Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a ceremony of novice ordination.
It begins with the pastoral junk.
After completing a period of a minimum of a year of postulancy, she then petitions for the novice.
The ceremony begins with three boughs to the Buddha as an acknowledgment of the original teaching of Shakyamuni Buddha.
And upon completion of that, the recipient then does three boughs to her parents as an acknowledgment of the genetic lineage.
That's her life.
And then finally, three boughs to the Kaishi or teacher of the precepts, in this case myself, representing the lineage of Buddhas that have passed down the teaching mind to mind for 2,500 years.
And it's in this ceremony that those things come together in the person of the recipient of the precepts and this ordination.
As with all of our ceremonies, it's not just simply a matter between the officiant and recipient, but rather it involves the entire Sangha.
Indeed, it involves the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.
And so, we'll all participate in a sense in a ceremony.
It's almost as if we're all taking these precepts along with Shuko.
And like all of the other ceremonies, that of marriage, that of taking the precepts, becoming a Buddhist, becoming a monk,
the time to do it is when it's already happened.
The time to become a monk is when you're already a monk.
So, it's a process that takes place within the individual themselves.
And what this is, is making visible that invisible thing by sharing it with the whole Sangha.
Everybody, please, Gashu.

Next we'll chant the Gatha of Atonement.
Again with everybody, please, Gassho.

Here we go.
Here we begin by taking a lock of your hair as a symbol of your intent to take the life
of the vows of a monk.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
And the crumble.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And we'll start with the, first with the five vows of the Shami monk, the Navas monk.
First, I vow to live a life of simplicity.
Will you maintain this?
To the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, to all beings.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
Third, I vow to develop a life of stability.
Will you maintain this?
Fourth, I vow to develop a life of selflessness.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
I will.
Fifth, I vow to accomplish the way.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
Now we'll take the sixteen precepts.
The sixteen precepts you've already received as a lay practitioner.
So, in a sense, this is the renewing of those sixteen precepts, which defined the life of a Buddha.
Everybody, please, God bless you.
Everybody, please, God show.
I take refuge in the Buddha.
I take refuge in the Dharma.
I take refuge in the Sangha.
I take refuge in the Buddha, the incomparably honored one.
I take refuge in the Dharma, honorable for its purity.
I take refuge in the Sangha, honorable for its harmony.
I have taken refuge in the Buddha, I have taken refuge in the Dharma, I have taken refuge in the Sangha.
Shant etc.
I have taken refuge in the Sangha's spirit.
I have taken refuge in the Buddha, and I have taken refuge in the Buddha.
Maintain this.
I will.
The first of the three treasures,
the first of the 16 precepts
are the three treasures,
taking refuge in the three treasures.
Next are the three pure precepts.
Three pure precepts
define the order of harmony
or reality.
The way that exists in the universe,
the way to be in harmony
and in peace
with the reality of life.
The first of these pure precepts,
three pure precepts,
is to cease from evil.
Will you maintain this?
The second of the three pure precepts
is to do good.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
And the third of the three pure precepts
is to do good for others.
Will you maintain this?
Will you maintain this?
The ten grave precepts
are the functioning
of the three precepts.
How do you cease from evil?
How do you do good?
How do you do good for others?
The first,
these ten grave precepts
are actually the functioning,
the activity
of those ten pure precepts.
The first of the ten grave precepts
is non-killing.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The second of the ten grave precepts
is not stealing.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The third of the ten grave precepts
is not being greedy.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The fourth of the ten grave precepts
is not telling lies.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The fifth of the ten grave precepts
is not being ignorant.
It is not clouding the mind.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The sixth of the ten grave precepts
is not speaking of others' errors and faults.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
The seventh of the ten grave precepts
is not elevating oneself
and blaming others.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
I will.
I will.
In the eighth
of the ten grave precepts
not being stingy
will you maintain this?
I will.
The ninth of the ten grave precepts
not being angry
will you maintain this?
I will.
And the tenth of the ten grave precepts
is not speaking ill of the three treasures.
To speak ill of the three treasures
is to even give rise to the thought
that there is a distinction
between Buddhas
and ordinary beings.
Will you maintain this?
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will.
I will.
These sixteen precepts
the three treasures
the three pure precepts
and the ten grave precepts
are handed down by Shakyamuni Buddha
generation after generation
to me
now I give them to you
will you maintain them well?
I will
will you maintain them well?
I will
will you really maintain them well?
I will
