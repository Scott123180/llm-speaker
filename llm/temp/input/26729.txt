The precepts, as most of you know, here at Saint Mountain Monastery, are one of the eight areas of training, along with Zazen, face-to-face teaching, academic study, liturgy, precepts, body practice, art practice, and work practice.
And each month during the two angos, we have fusatsu, or renewal of vows.
And during the fusatsu ceremony, we usually address some point or teaching from the precepts.
Normally, the precepts are taught one-to-one between the teacher and the student.
That is, between the students that are about to receive the precepts and the teacher.
And usually not much is said publicly, except in very general terms.
So, the talks during the fusatsu are usually general talks that present some kind of an overview of what's going on in the teachings of the precepts.
The precepts are basically the definition of the life of a Buddha.
They're based on realization.
They're based on having realized the same truth that has been realized by the Buddha and all of the subsequent Buddhas that followed.
It's a manifestation of that realization in the world of differentiation.
That is, it's the actualization of the realization of the Buddha in the world.
And during the ceremony, there are four things that are given and received.
And those four things are the sixteen precepts themselves, or one.
The raksu, or kesabh, robe of the Buddha, is two.
The lineage of Buddhas and ancestors is the third.
And a Dharma name is the fourth.
It's given from the teacher to the student.
And usually, the precepts are received at the very beginning of training,
within a year or two or three of having begun serious training.
They're also the very last thing that we deal with before training is complete.
After all the koan study is completed,
in our lineage we then do 120 koans on the precepts,
which are a way of testing whether or not those precepts have been realized and actualized.
So, in the very beginning, having received these precepts,
we receive them on a basis of faith.
We assume that what the teacher is saying when he says,
these precepts are the definition of the life of a Buddha,
that that's the truth.
Because we don't know that from our own experience.
And so, in that way, the precepts aren't much different
in terms of the mental attitude of receiving them
as they are in precepts of other religions.
Basically, in taking these precepts,
we acknowledge our faith in the fact that we,
each one of us, are a Buddha.
We accept these precepts as a guide
to the way that we live our lives.
We make a vow to practice the precepts,
the way we practice the breath,
the way we practice our lives.
Then, after a while, as our training evolves and develops,
there comes a point of realization.
That realization is seeing for oneself
or experiencing for oneself.
having dropped away body and mind.
That dropping away of body and mind
is the realization of the precepts,
is the realization of the Buddha nature.
Then the practice continues.
The peak of the mountain is not yet
the end of formal training in Zen.
And so it continues to actualization.
That actualization means the manifestation of the precepts,
the manifestation of the Buddha nature.
And when you look at those precepts,
they seem to be very binding.
How can such binding rules
be about freedom,
about liberation?
In actual fact,
when you really understand what they're about,
you begin to see
that that's what they're about,
freedom.
Restrictions,
hindrances have to do with
greed, anger, and ignorance.
That's where the bondage comes from.
The flip side of greed,
anger, and ignorance,
or wisdom,
compassion,
and realization
is very liberating.
So they're not to bind you,
but rather to make you free.
Morality
and enlightenment
are inseparable.
They're inseparably related to each other,
so much so
that one without the other
is not yet authentic,
incomplete.
Nirvana
is not beyond good and evil
as it's usually interpreted.
as we read in
Bujizhen.
But actually,
a mode of existence
with a definite moral commitment
which is realized
and actualized
within the realm
of good and evil,
within the realm
of cause and effect.
And yet,
undefiled by them.
Undefiled by good and evil.
Undefiled by cause and effect.
So in other words,
spiritual realization,
spiritual freedom
of necessity
springs from
moral commitment.
Evil deeds cause
evil consequences.
good deeds
cause good consequences.
What is good?
What is evil?
And that's what the three pure precepts
lay down.
Refrain from all evil.
Practice all that's good.
do good for others.
This is the realization
of enlightenment.
The basis
of a moral and ethical life.
The actualization
of enlightenment.
the ten grave precepts
are its functioning.
How to do it.
The vow to practice them
is in and of itself
the act of receiving the precepts.
To manifest them in our life
and actions
is to manifest
the life of the Buddha.
Is
the action
of a Buddha.
When that happens,
that is the transmission
of the precepts.
Very different than receiving them.
Precepts are transmitted
at the end of training.
They're received
at the beginning of training.
That first
cease from evil
is sometimes called
a precept of realizing
the law.
And basically
what this is
is the definition
of
the life
of Buddhas.
The root
of realization.
The precept
to do good
is the precept
also
called
the precept
of actualizing good.
That is
actualizing
anyuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
Do good
for others
is also
called
the precept
of benefiting
sentient beings.
You see
the difference
between
do good
and do good
for others.
Do good
for others
is to transcend
both profane
and sacred.
To liberate
oneself
and to save
others.
That's
compassionate
activity
in the world.
I wanted
to say
something
about
the
lineage.
To me
the lineage
is a teaching.
A very
important
teaching.
It's
history
and historical
significance
notwithstanding.
It is
intrinsically
a teaching.
historically
we can
say
that
lineage
became
important
because
Zen
was in
China.
And in
China
in
Confucianism
a great
deal
of importance
is placed
on
ancestry.
You need
to be able
to trace
yourself
back
through the
ages.
And so
Chinese
Buddhists
made sure
all the
holes
were filled.
When they
needed
someone for
the second
ancestor
Ika to
have received
the
transmission
from,
Bodhidharma
appeared,
a synthesis
of several
Indian monks
that brought
the teachings
from China.
Gaps in
the Indian
lineage
where
historical
accounts
are very
vague
were filled.
But that's
not what the
lineage is
about.
In fact,
I've mentioned
before that
in our own
lineage
there's a
point
where one
of the
teachers
finally
reached
90 years
of age.
all of
the
successes
he had
transmitted
to had
already
died.
He
outlived
them all
and none
of them
had
transmitted
and here
he was
about to
die
and he
had no
one to
transmit
to to
carry on
the
lineage.
He
had a
very
close
friend
who
had
received
the
Rinzai
lineage.
He
asked him
to take
the
lineage
and he
said he
already had
a
lineage
and he
wouldn't.
So then he
asked him
to wait
until one
of his
students
has become
fully
matured
and can
satisfy him
and then
please pass
the lineage
on to him
and that
he did
and that
lineage
continues
down to
this time
and this
place
yet it's
broken.
So what
is that
lineage
that we
speak of?
What is
the unbroken
mind-to-mind
transmission
generation
to generation
we call
it the
Kichimiyaku
the
blood
lineage
I'm going
to need
something
I'm losing
my voice
a squish
of lemon
in it
if you've
got it
if not
water
is okay
yeah
the Kichimiyaku
is a document
that's passed
on
during the
ceremony
it's a
chart
that begins
with a
circle
and out
of that
circle
emerges
the name
of Shakyamuni
Buddha
and there's
a red line
that runs
out of it
to Shakyamuni
right through
the center
of the name
of Shakyamuni
Buddha
and then
right through
the center
of the name
Mayakaya Shapa
right through
the center
of the name
Ananda
and so on
up and down
it goes
like a sign
wave
passing through
the names
of all of
the ancestors
down through
the ancestors
in India
then those
in China
those in Japan
and then to
the present day
and in
the ceremony
the teacher
Kaishi
adds the
name of the
student who
is receiving
the precepts
as the next
name after
his own
and the line
continues from
there
and then
returns
back to
that
circle
at the
beginning
the Kichimiyaku
itself
if you look
at it
you realize
that what it
is is a
great circle
in and of
itself
because it
starts from
that one
circle
it goes
through all
these swiggles
and then back
up to the
top of that
circle
so if you
stretched it
all out
it would be
one gigantic
circle
and when
you receive
that
you essentially
place yourself
in that
circle of
ancestry
the Kichimiyaku
is the
absolute
body of
equality
being one
it's the
life stream
of all
successive
buddhas
and ancestors
it's the
life stream
of all
sentient
beings
they're all
intrinsically
one
sentient
beings
insentient
buddhas
and ancestors
that circle
is the
pure
dharmakaya
the absolute
basis of
reality
it's from
that
pure
dharmakaya
or absolute
basis
that the
ten thousand
things
spring from
that circle
is the
expression
of the
totality
of reality
which is
state
of realization
of both
animate and
inanimate
beings
of being
of Buddha
of all
phenomena
it's
unstained
and undefiled
it's not
pure
and it's
without
increase
and without
decrease
it's not
impure
Dogen
Zenji
in his
teaching
in Fukan
Zazengi
says
starts off
the first
line
the way
is basically
perfect
and all
pervading
how could
it be
contingent
upon
practice
and realization
that statement
is the
explanation
of that
circle
it's not
reality as
opposed to
non-reality
it goes beyond
real or
unreal
diluted or
not diluted
and this
evening as I
was preparing
to come
here I
started thinking
of the
diversity of
people that
we have here
and the
tremendous
interrelationships
that exist
among us
there's someone
here who is
trained with
the lineage
of Suzuki
Roshi
Shinra Suzuki
Roshi
in San
Francisco
people here
who have
practiced
with
Noak Roshi
in Maine
people who
have practiced
with
Philip
Kaplow
with
Tangan
Harada
Roshi
with
Son
Nakagawa
Roshi
all of
these
lineages
are interrelated
in this
country
it's kind
of extraordinary
the connections
when
Isai
brought
Rinzai Zen
to Japan
what he
brought was
what was
called the
Yogi
branch
of Rinzai Zen
and what
was transmitted
to Dogen
when he
studied with
Mio Zen
and Isai
was that
Yogi
branch
and actually
the only place
that that's
alive today
is in the
Soto
lineage
through Dogen
when Dogen
received the
lineage chart
from Tendo
Nyojo
the lineage chart
was different
than the one
that's transmitted
in the Soto
lineage
it didn't have
the Rinzai
thing on it
because
Tendo Nyojo
was just strictly
pure Soto
lineage
and so
Dogen Zenji
added his
Rinzai lineage
and that
continued down
in the meantime
that Yogi
lineage
disappeared
and what
sprang up
in
Japan
was the
Oryu
lineage
that's what
Hakuin
that we were
talking about
the other day
penetrating
laughter
Hakuin
that was the
Oryu
lineage that he
was transmitted
that broke
into two
branches
after him
Gasan
Zenji
transmitted that
to two people
one by the name
of Takuju
and one by the
name of Inzan
and those
became two
lineages
those two
lineages
are the two
surviving lineages
in Japan today
one of them
the Takuju
is the one
that Genpo
Yamamoto
Roshi
transmitted to
Soen Roshi
and he
transmitted to
Edo Roshi
that's what
Daibusatsu's
lineage is
another one
is the one
that
Sogaku
Harada
Roshi
received
Soto lineage
came to him
and that
Rinzai Takuju
lineage came to him
he transmitted
that to
Yasatani Roshi
Yasatani Roshi
transmitted that
to
Maizumi Roshi
Yasatani Roshi
was also the
teacher of
Philip Kaplow
out of that
lineage of
Yasatani
came
Aiken Roshi
and the
branches of
that
Tangan
Harada
Roshi
that some
of the
people here
have studied
with
the other
lineage
the
Inzan
lineage
went to
Soen Shaku
Soen Shaku
was one of
the people
that first
came here
to this
country
and brought
Zen
he influenced
the first
Zen Institute
Mary Farkas
Ruth Fuller
Sasaki
in the first
Zen Institute
Gary Snyder
studied with
one of that
lineage
with
Oda Roshi
Walter
Nowak
from Maine
was transmitted
that
lineage
that lineage
also came
down through
us via
Maizumi Roshi
from
Koryu Roshi
and so
through those
three lineages
everyone in
this room
who has
practiced
in other
places
has
connected
in San
Francisco's
Zen Center
when they
chant the
names of
the Buddhas
it's the
same
down to
a certain
point
and then
the branches
start
their
lineage
is different
than our
lineage
the same
with Sensei
she chants
the same
to a certain
point
and then
her branch
is different
but we all
connect back
to that
same
Dharmakaya
but that
Dharmakaya
manifests in
many ways
when you
really look
at it
when you
look at it
in terms
of our
own
genetic
lineage
and the
interrelatedness
of all
beings
just
genetically
look at it
in terms
of our
relationship
to the
insentient
the storm
that brought
the rain
today
it traveled
across the
Pacific
dropping
moisture
and picking
up moisture
as it
went
I don't
know where
it started
over there
where it
first began
to gather
but it
sure did
a lot of
exchanging
with Oregon
and California
and the
Midwest
as it
came
dropping
moisture
picking up
moisture
and comes
here and
deposits it
on our
mountain
seeps into
the earth
fills the
underground
streams
dissolves
the solids
that have
been here
for hundreds
of millions
of years
that were
moved by
glaciers
from the
northern part
of the
earth
feeds
the kale
and the
tomatoes
in the
garden
that we
consume
and make
it all
part of
our own
being
and the
waste
that we
produce
returns
back to
the soil
and the
cycle
continues
and the
moisture
is picked
up
becomes
clouds
continues
its
journey
and
everything
is in
that
all the
good
stuff
and all
the
bad
stuff
all the
shit
and all
the purity
and we
consume
it
and we
create it
that too
is the
pure
dharmakaya
perfect and
complete
reaching
everywhere
out of
which all
existence
emerges
and so
when you
identify
with that
pure
dharmakaya
you identify
with the
enlightenment
the
realization
of all
buddhas
that's
what they
realize
they realize
the mutual
identity
of all
things
they realize
the interdependency
of all
things
they realize
that all
things
mutually
arise
are
codependent
interpenetrate
there's not
a single
speck of
dust in
this entire
universe
that doesn't
affect
every other
thing
that's
why
there's
no
coming
or
going
that's
why
in
birth
not a
single
particle
is
added
that's
why
in
death
not a
single
atom
is
lost
pure
undefiled
dharmakaya
so those
precepts
those
the
kichyamyaku
that lineage
chart
is not
just a
chart
a list
of names
it's the
pure
dharmakaya
itself
it's the
life
of all
beings
sentient
and
insentient
the second
thing
that's
given
is the
raksu
the
tathagata
teaching
we chant
vast
is the
robe
of
liberation
we call
it the
robe
of
liberation
a
formless
field
of
benefaction
I wear
the
tathagata
teaching
saving
all
sentient
beings
it's
kind
of
interesting
that
that
robe
of
liberation
is
the
bringing
together
of
fragments
of
cloth
it's
pieces
sewn
together
it's
making
whole
from
fragmentation
and
traditionally
these
fragments
of
cloth
were
picked
up
from
corpses
and
sewn
together
to make
a robe
a
kesa
like
this
the raksu
is a
miniature
of this
kesa
and we
say
vast
is the
robe
of
liberation
vast
means
boundless
it
means
having
no
edges
it
means
reaching
everywhere
no
different
than
that
pure
dharmakaya
a
formless
field
of
benefaction
the
formlessness
is in
its
emptiness
having
no
fixed
characteristics
fixed
characteristics
immediately
create
barriers
is
dependent
upon
having
no
fixed
form
I
wear
the
Tathagata's
teaching
Tathagata
is the
name
of the
Buddha
but it's
also the
name
of
suchness
thusness
I
wear
the
teachings
of
thusness
this
very
momentness
things
as
they
are
ness
saving
all
sentient
beings
being
saved
saved
by all
sentient
beings
that
cloth
that we
call
the
raksu
becomes
sacred
when we
make it
sacred
when we
put it
together
then
when you
place it
on your
head and
do that
chant
it means
something
otherwise
it's a
piece of
rag
Dogen
Zenji
said
that the
Kesa
should be
made
from
discarded
cloth
cloth
that's
unimportant
cloth
that's
waste
cloth
that's
been
chewed
by
rodents
cloth
that's
decaying
so that
there's
no
specialness
about it
but he
also said
that even
if it's
gold and
brocade
so long
that it's
given
with no
strings
attached
and sincere
giving
that makes
whatever it
is
pure
each
time
you
place
that
raksu
on your
head
and chant
the verse
of the
Kesa
it's a
reminder
of what
your life's
about
for a lay
practitioner
that's
what
shaving
my head
does
for me
each
time I
shave
my head
I am
reminded
what I
have decided
to do
with my
life
every
five
days
I
remember
just in
case
I
forgot
every
morning
when you
place that
raksu
on your
head
and chant
the verse
of the
Kesa
it's to
remind
you
that
vast
is the
robe
of
liberation
a
formless
field
of
benefaction
that you
wear the
Tathagasa's
teachings
saving all
sentient
beings
you
acknowledge
the fact
that you've
placed yourself
in that
circle of
Buddhas
which includes
the
Dharmakaya
itself
that is
all
existence
past
present
and future
you
acknowledge
that you
are a
Buddha
realized
or not
and you
vow
to live
your life
in accord
with the
way a
Buddha
lives their
life
the
precepts
it's no
small thing
to be born
human
with birth
with human
birth
immediately
arises
a great
spectrum
of
possibility
that
rages at
one end
from the
awful
the
Genghis
Kahn's
and Adolf
Hitler's
of this
world
the killers
and the
rapists
the child
molesters
and the
thieves
to the
other end
the
Buddhas
and the
Moses
and the
Jesus
and everything
in between
and that
giant
spectrum
is all
one
reality
and the
potential
for any
aspect of
that
spectrum
exists
in the
life of
each one
of us
the choice
is ours
how we
choose
to manifest
our life
the way
is clear
the decision
is yours
