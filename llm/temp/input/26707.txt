The Book of Equanimity, Case 57, Gonyo's Thing, Preface to the Assembly.
Playing with reflections, struggling for the form, you don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection.
Raising your voice to stop an echo, you don't know that the voice is the root of the echo.
If it's not riding an ox, looking for an ox, then it's using a wedge to remove a wedge.
How can you avoid these extremes?
The main case.
The Venerable Gonyo asked Joshu, when not a single thing is brought, then what?
Joshu said, put it down.
Then, Gonyo said, if I don't bring a single thing, what should I put down?
Joshu said, then carry it out.
The verse.
Not prepared for meticulous action, he loses the first to move.
Realizing himself, the coarseness of his mind, he is embarrassed at bumping his head.
When the game is ended, the axe handles rotted at his side.
Clean and purify the ordinary bones to play with the immortals.
And this koan addresses the business of the baggage and blinders that we carry with us all the time.
And how it restricts what we can see and how we can function and what our capacity is.
It really addresses the question of how to be free.
We fill ourselves with ideas, opinions, positions, or it's with fear, anxiety, greed, or anger.
Or after many years of practice, we fill ourselves with understanding, with spirituality, with clarity, with accomplishment.
Or we fill ourselves with attachment, or non-attachment, or sacredness, or profaneness.
All of these things, all of these things, fill the cup.
All of these things make it impossible to be open, to be receptive, to receive, to truly see, hear, taste, touch, feel.
They're all based on separation.
They're all based on the mind moving, grabbing onto things.
This week and this weekend, we did two workshops.
One of the workshops was a hermitage workshop.
At the heart of that workshop was sacred space.
Well, I ask you, how do you recognize sacred space?
What is sacred space?
What is profane space?
What is sacred inner space?
And is inner space and outer space different?
If so, how is it different?
If not, why not?
We did a workshop also on the mind of movement.
I've asked four people who did that workshop.
What is the mind of movement?
No one was able to answer me.
Where is it?
What is it?
Can you bring it to me?
There's a mind of movement.
There must be a mind of stillness.
What is that?
Are they the same or are they different?
It's very easy to get caught up in all of the ideas that describe practice and to miss in the process the practice itself.
We're always busily accomplishing something, chasing something.
And while we're doing that, while we fill ourselves with our preoccupations and expectations,
we miss the place upon which we stand.
And yet there's not a one of us that ever fails to fill that space completely.
In the introduction, this is playing with reflections, struggling for form.
You don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection.
By preoccupying ourselves with the ideas that describe reality, we miss the reality.
The ideas of the reflection of that reality.
The ideas of the words and concepts that we use to describe that.
But what's the reality itself?
It's easy to draw pictures.
It's easy to talk about it.
But unless you see for yourself personally what it is, it doesn't impart any strength.
Raising your voice to stop an echo, you don't know the voice is the root of the echo.
It doesn't matter what we attach to.
The result is the same.
Whether you're attaching to a Mercedes or to Buddhism or to enlightenment,
the delusion is just as deep.
And the delusion doesn't have to do with Mercedes being profane and enlightenment being sacred.
Neither of them are profane or sacred.
It's got to do with attachment.
It's got to do with holding on.
In order to hold on, you need a holder.
And the thing that the holder is holding, that's two.
The reality realized and actualized by all of the Buddhas and sages and enlightened ones is not two.
So the question is how do you transcend that duality of this and that, self and other,
of sacred and profane, of mind and no mind,
how can you avoid these extremes?
The venerable Gonyo asked Joshu,
when not a single thing is brought, then what?
Joshu said, put it down.
What's he talking about?
If there's not a single thing, what is there to put down?
Another monk once asked,
Master Hoji,
when feelings arise,
wisdom is blocked.
When characteristics change,
the body differs.
How is it when feelings haven't arisen?
The master said,
blocked.
The monk said,
if feelings haven't arisen,
what can they block?
This is exactly the same question
that this question is in this coin.
The master commenting on this said,
brash fellows are much the same.
Joshu said to him,
then put it,
then carry it out.
You can't put it down,
carry it out,
carry it with you.
Gonyo said,
if I don't bring a single thing,
what should I put down?
If I have nothing,
what is there to get rid of?
I have nothing is something.
It's a big something.
It's what we call the sickness
of having no sickness whatsoever.
The master
wrote a verse on this coin.
He said,
not bringing a single thing,
both shoulders can't bear it up.
That's how big it is,
not a single thing.
It's so heavy,
he can barely carry it.
At the words,
he suddenly knows his error.
In his heart,
his boundless joy.
Since from poisonous ill,
he forgot what was on his mind.
Snakes and tigers
have been his intimates.
Empty and still
for a thousand years,
the pure breeze
still hasn't stopped.
Somehow,
when we talk about things,
and it's the basic
method of communication
that we have,
it doesn't get through.
It doesn't seem to register.
I mean,
we say again
and again
and again.
Every one of these
koans
is presenting the truth.
Every talk,
every sutra,
every verse
is constantly
pointing to it.
And nobody sees it.
In this koan itself,
Ganyo,
when Joshua said,
then carry it out,
Ganyo was enlightened.
All of you
are hearing
the same thing.
So we should have
a mass kensho.
Why doesn't it happen?
Why is it
that sometimes
the words connect
and other times
they don't connect?
In that
building of the hermitage.
Where was the teaching?
I have a student
that's been practicing
here for about
six years.
That's what she asks me
every time
she comes to Doksan.
She describes
some event
that happened
and then she says,
where was the teaching?
Where is the teaching?
Sometimes it's hard
to see.
There's a classic
story of,
I forget who it is,
either Milarepa
or Naropa,
one or two
or the other
or both of them
maybe.
One was the master,
one was the disciple.
The disciple
was a great builder,
a carpenter,
an expert,
a professional.
Those are the most
difficult to deal with,
experts and professionals.
And particularly
when you're dealing
with them
in your own field
of expertise
and professionalism.
It's as if
the door will close,
there's nothing else
to learn
and definitely
nothing to learn
from someone
who is not
a fellow,
professional,
or expert
in that field.
And so,
such was the case
in this
disciple
who came to the master
and said,
please teach me.
The master said,
you're a builder,
aren't you?
He said, yes.
He said,
then please
build me a house.
Build a large house,
four stories high
and so many feet wide
and so many feet deep
and he described
how he wanted it
and he said,
and I want it here.
So,
the builder
set to work on it.
If he would build
this house,
he would receive
the teachings.
He worked on it
for three years
and finally
it was complete.
He told the master,
here it is,
just like you asked.
What are the teachings?
The master said,
I didn't tell you
to build it there.
I said,
build it over there.
So,
take it down
and build it over there
and he took it down
and you rebuilt it
over there.
Three years later
when it was complete,
he came back
and said,
the house is finished.
Where are the teachings?
He said,
that's not where
I said to build it.
I wanted it over there.
Take it down
and move it.
Build it over there.
Down came the house,
up it went
and the next place.
Halfway through it
he realized
himself.
He realized
the teachings.
He understood
what was going on.
So,
what is it
that's going on
in the building?
Where is the teaching?
Is it
the finished building?
Is it
the sacred place?
Is it
the design?
The discussions?
What is the teaching
in Zazen?
You just sit there
doing nothing.
Where is the teachings
in the service,
in the chanting,
in the bowing?
Where is the teachings
in the work?
If you wait
for someone
to give it to you,
you waste your time.
It can't be given.
If you wait
to receive it
from someone
or somewhere,
you waste your time.
It can't be received.
Ten thousand Buddhas
couldn't give it to you.
Not a single one of them
has ever received it.
Then what is
this marvelous
teaching
that can't be given
and can't be received?
I remember
a very similar thing
happening to me
when I went to study
with
Minor White.
Minor White
was a professor
of photography
at MIT.
He was also known
as the Eastern Guru
of photography
because of his
unusual ways
of teaching.
I had admired
his photography
and I had admired
his work
for many, many years
and finally
an opportunity
came to go
and study with him
for ten days
of intensive study.
How intensive
I hadn't even
dreamed of.
And I had a
very large sum
of money
which took a long
time to gather.
And finally
I got to the workshop
and immediately
first day
four o'clock
in the morning
were all out
in the field
60 of us
dancing.
The teacher
that I'd spent
a thousand dollars
to study with
was dancing
in the line
with us.
There was a strange
woman up in front
of us
showing us
how to move.
And then after
we danced
we did
meditation.
Then we did yoga.
Then I had to
be a camera
while someone
led me around
with my eyes
closed.
Then I had to
dance with a tree.
Four days.
I never touched
my camera.
We didn't take
a picture.
Where is the
teaching?
I asked.
And the old
man smiled.
And before
that
ten days
was finished
my whole life.
was turned
upside down.
He had opened
my eyes
by ripping
the eyelids off.
I went there
filled with
expectation
on what a
photography teacher
has to do.
What does it
mean to study
photography?
What does it
mean to know
the difference
between looking
and seeing?
Filled with
all of those
expectations
and ideas
there was no
room
for anything
else.
That kind
of blindness
prevents us
from hearing
seeing
receiving
touching
tasting.
When not a
single thing
is brought
then what?
This monk
Gonyo
was convinced
he didn't have
a single thing.
just that
idea
itself
is a
burden
that's
totally
unbearable.
It just
crushes you
into the
earth,
smothers
you,
covers you,
blinds you,
deafens you,
numbs you.
That's why
Joshua said
put it
down.
If I
don't bring
the single
thing,
what should
I put
down?
Someone
that's not
carrying a
single thing
doesn't ask
that kind
of question.
He
persisted
in believing
that he
didn't have
a single
thing.
So Joshua
said,
then carry
it out.
There's
nothing you
can do
with someone
like this.
completely
closed,
completely
full.
One of
the things
that we
run into
all the
time
is not
having a
question.
Eakin
Roshi
talks about
it in
his book
Taking
the Path
of Zen.
He
describes
it in
terms of
when he
was a
school
teacher.
He
said,
when he
was a
school
teacher,
the
student
that
threw
a piece
of
chalk
at him
when his
back was
turned,
he was
able to
do
something
with.
There was
a possibility
for
communication.
But the
one that
did nothing
was hopeless.
There was
nothing that
could be
done.
So many
people
don't have
a question.
if
if
when
everyone
else
panics
you
remain
calm
perhaps
you
don't
understand
the
problem.
So is
that
possibility.
Without
a question
a person
is either
dull,
dim
witted,
or a
dead
horse.
Buddha
talked about
the four
kinds of
horses.
A horse
that moves
at the
shadow
of a
whip.
The
horse
that only
moves
when the
whip
touches
its
skin.
The
horse
that
only
moves
when the
whip
cuts
its
skin.
And he
always
compared
that to
a kind
of
student.
One
that
moves
at the
shadow
of the
whip.
You
don't
even
need
to
say
anything.
It
knows
and it
goes.
He
never
mentioned
the
dead
horse.
The
dead
horse
is my
own
classification.
There's
nothing
you can
do
with
a
dead
horse
except
a nice
memorial
service
perhaps.
Bury
it
before
it
stinks.
So
either
of those
three
things
usually
smothers
any kind
of question.
But also
some
people are
forgetful.
That is
their
mind
keeps
bouncing
from
thing to
thing.
so the
question
never
materializes
itself.
It
never
crystallizes
into
something.
Or
they
have a
full
house
that is
a full
deck
or a
full
cup.
There's
no room
for any
questions.
Or
sometimes
they're
frightened.
That's
very
similar
to
forgetful.
That
creates
a lot
of
scattered
energy
and it's
hard to
bring it
all
to a
point.
And
there's
always
the
possibility
that the
person is
enlightened.
Someone
who has
realized
themselves,
someone who
is clear
that
rhinoceros
horn of
doubt is
completely
shattered.
It's
always
very easy
to tell
these
different
types
apart.
So we
reveal it
every time.
With every
movement we
reveal it.
With every
word that
we say we
reveal it.
With every
gesture,
every
action.
It's
not difficult
to tell
which is
which.
In the
verse it
says,
not prepared
for meticulous
action,
he loses
to the
first move.
Realizing
himself the
coarseness of
his mind,
he is
embarrassed at
bumping his
head.
When the
game has
ended,
the axe
handles
rotted at
his side.
Clean and
purify the
ordinary bones
to play
with the
immortals.
Not prepared
for meticulous
action,
he loses
to the
first move.
Of course,
this is a
reference to
Joshu,
the master,
and Gonyo,
the disciple,
in that
interchange.
It also
is using
as an
example
a game
of chess.
There's no
contest in a
chess game
unless you
move.
Two opponents
stand there,
no one
makes a
move.
There's no
game.
Or when you
can't move,
there's no
game.
So there's
got to be
that movement
for something
to happen.
That's what
the question
is.
otherwise
you'll
sit there
and rot.
The
reference to
the
axe handles
being rotted
has to do
with an
old
legend
about
someone
around
the
year
400
in China
who
was off
in the
mountains
gathering
firewood
when he
came to
a stone
grotto
and he
looked in
and there
were four
boys in
there playing
chess.
They gave
him something
that looked
like a date
and after he
ate it he
wasn't hungry
anymore.
When the game
was ended
the axe
handle
that he
had
had rotted
at his
side
and his
clothes
had
completely
disintegrated.
It's kind
of a
Rip Van
Winkle
story.
Several
decades
had passed
during that
period of
time.
Not
prepared for
meticulous
action he
loses to
the first
move.
Realizing
himself
the
coarseness
of his
mind he
is embarrassed
at bumping
his head.
The
coarseness
of his
mind is
that
attachment
grabbing
on to
everything.
That's
why I
ask you
what is
the mind?
What is
the mind
of movement?
Where is
it?
Is it
large?
Is it
small?
Is it
different
than the
mind of
stillness?
Is it
different
than the
enlightened
mind or
the
ordinary
mind?
One
master
commenting
on this
said that
some say
that pure
tranquility
is the
real basis
of the
path.
The
unconcerned
are little
immortals.
Then he
goes on
to say
even so
don't
take
unconcerned
for
unconcerned.
Time
and again
concern
is born
of unconcerned.
What kind
of person
is a person
that has
no question?
Obviously
it's someone
that has all
the answers.
No concern
is the
same
as no
question.
One
master
added
commentaries
line by
line on
this koan.
On the
first one
where
Ganyo
asked
Joshu
when not
a single
thing
is brought
then what?
Footnote
says
this
is still
beyond
him
when not
a single
thing
is brought
is beyond
him.
Put it
down.
The
robe and
shirt
the
commentaries
is the
robe and
shirt
sticking
to the
body
understand
that you
should
shed
them.
Ganyo
said
if I
don't
bring
a single
thing
what should
I put
down?
Footnote
says
people
don't
know
their
own
faults
oxen
don't
know
the
magnitude
of
their
strength.
It's
very hard
to see
ourselves
very
easy
to deceive
ourselves
and one
of the
biggest
diseases
of all
the
diseases
is that
we carry
the same
patterns
throughout
our life
that's
the
difficulty
that's
the
conditioning
and it
starts at
such a
young age
that we're
not even
aware of
it.
There's a
little bit
of our
program
that comes
from our
parents
from our
teachers
from our
culture
from our
nation
from our
religion
from our
peers
from our
education
so that
by the
time we're
full grown
we walk
around like
robots
responding to
circumstances
and to
people
according to
the program
like every
good robot
should.
There's no
freedom
there's no
originality
there's no
vitality
there's no
life
our
noses
are in
the hands
of that
program
how do we
break free
of it?
Well
we'll do
spiritual
practice
and what
we proceed
to do
is to
replace
all of
the things
we were
holding
on to
that are
so-called
material
things
with all
the new
spiritual
things.
now we
cling
to robes
and
raksus
the smell
of incense
chanting
and bowing
koans
enlightenment
realization
zen
until the
stink is
so great
it permeates
the ten
directions.
It's the
same thing
all over
again just
with a
whole new
set of
names.
We still
haven't gotten
to the
root of
it.
We've
taken care
of the
reflection
but we
haven't
taken care
of the
form.
How do
you get
to the
root of
things?
The
first
and most
important
lesson
is to
learn how
to just
simply
shut up
and sit.
Not
just sit
but shut
up and
sit.
nobody
ever
taught us
that.
With
all of
the
understanding
and knowledge
in the
world
this
is probably
the single
most important
the ability
to be able
to shut
up
and sit.
Our
ancestors
had that
ability.
The
stone
age
cultures
had that
ability.
Cats
and dogs
have that
ability.
Hummingbirds
and butterflies
know how
to get
still.
But somehow
we seem
to have
lost it.
Somewhere
in the
process
of evolution.
20th
century
humanity
is
constantly
frantic.
We may
outwardly
appear calm
but inside
it's
constantly
churning.
the mind
is moving
and grabbing
and clinging
and manipulating
and turning
understanding
analyzing
judging
categorizing
time to
shut up
and sit.
Sounds
easy.
It's not
probably the
most difficult
thing any of
us will ever
do in our
lives.
And just
because you
put on a
gray robe
and a
rock suit
doesn't make
it happen.
Or a
black robe
and a
kesa
doesn't make
it happen.
We sit
there and
for a
moment
there's
stillness
and then
for the
next five
years we
appreciate
the stillness.
Wasn't it
beautiful?
Isn't it
nice?
I wonder
if it's
the same
as
Joshu's
stillness
and
cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha
and it's
long gone.
It's no
longer
functioning.
That
simple
stillness
is a
constant
practice
no matter
how far
we evolve
no matter
how enlightened
we become
no matter
how many
daiken
shows
and how
much
clarity
always
we must
return to
the source
that
stillness.
A mind
that doesn't
move is
filled with
possibilities.
Everything
is possible.
The mind
that moves
there are
no possibilities.
we do
a little
exercise
in a
photography
workshop
here.
I ask
the students
to go
out
and to
photograph
with no
preconceived
idea
of what
their subject
is going
to be.
To just
go out
and discover
it or
be
discovered
by the
subject.
Don't
look for
it.
Don't
go out
with a
preconceived
idea.
Because if
you go out
with a
preconceived
idea,
two things
can happen.
One is
you'll find
what you're
looking for
and the
other is
you won't
find what
you're
looking for.
In either
case,
you're blind
to everything
else,
to the
10,000
things,
to the
whole
phenomenal
universe,
to everything
that you
hear,
see,
smell,
taste,
and touch.
The only
way
to be
open and
receptive to
all that,
to unify
with all
of that,
is to
put down
the baggage,
unload the
saddlebags,
strip off
the blinders,
naked and
free.
Everything
is possible.
There are
no hindrances.
The last
line says,
clean and
purify the
ordinary bones
to play
with the
immortals.
And what
he's saying
is that
each one
of us,
just as
we are,
just as
we are,
contains
all of
the clarity,
all of
the possibilities
of the
sages,
the wise
ones,
the enlightened
ones,
but it's
buried.
We can't
see it,
we can't
feel it,
in that
simple,
direct
practice
of zazen.
Just being
with the
breath,
breath
after breath,
without
anything
extra,
just
watching
the flow
of your
thoughts,
without
any
outside
help,
within
that
is the
power
to take
the darkness
out of the
night.
Within
that
is the
power
to see
beyond
the light
of day.
Then you
will realize
for yourself
that the
truth,
that the
way,
has nothing
to do
with either
lightness or
darkness,
either
absoluteness
or
relativeness,
neither
sacredness or
profaneness,
moving mind,
still mind,
heavenly
mind,
earthly
mind.
The
ordinary
bones
are the
bones of
the
immortals.
The
ordinary
bones,
your bones
and my
bones,
are the
bones of
the sages
and wise
ones.
It's
just that
it's so
hard to
see it
because of
all that
activity,
because of
all of
that
conditioning,
because of
all the
things we
hold on
to.
It's
truly
nothing
special
what we're
speaking of.
It's
truly the
ordinary
life of
each one
of us,
easy to
talk about,
very difficult
to see.
I only
wish is
that you
take back
from this
week of
study or
this weekend
of study,
just a
little bit
of that
zazen,
bring it
into your
life,
start each
day with
it,
end each
day with
it,
ten minutes,
just that
much time
out of your
day,
give it an
opportunity to
work,
but really
do it.
Don't just
sit there,
engage it,
work with
it,
be the
breath,
breath
after breath,
forget the
self.
When you
forget the
self,
there's
nothing
to hang
on to,
there's no
one to do
the hanging,
empty and
still for
a thousand
years,
the pure
breeze
still hasn't
stopped.
That pure
breeze
is the
life of
each one
of us,
present
every day,
every moment,
from before
we were
born,
to continue
long after
we're born.
it's only
a matter
of seeing
it for
yourself.
Thank you.
