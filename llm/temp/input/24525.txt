Thank you.
Good morning, everyone.
When the service happened this morning and it was Hakuin Zenji's Memorial Day,
I decided to shift gears a little bit since my talk was on song
and the nature of religious praise, in a sense,
to begin with Hakuin's Song of Zazen.
And Hakuin is a really wonderful character in a lot of ways in the history of Zen.
He was enlightened originally at the age of 24 at the sound of the temple gong,
just like the gong we just heard.
And it was a very deep enlightenment,
but at the same time, immediately thereafter, an enormous arrogance formed.
And he became very difficult to handle.
And in reflection, years later, he said it was only the killing sword of his teacher
who stayed with him and continued to work on the arrogance that evolved after his enlightenment
that actually opened his heart to the way.
So Hakuin Zenji's Song of Zazen.
Sentient beings are, in essence, Buddhas.
It's like ice and water.
There's no ice without water.
There are no Buddhas outside sentient beings.
What a shame that sentient beings seek afar, not knowing what is at hand.
It's like wailing from thirst in the midst of water
or wandering lost among the poor, although born a rich man's child.
The cause of rebirth in the six realms is the darkness of our delusion.
Treading dark path after dark path, when can we escape birth and death?
Zazen goes beyond all praise.
Giving, keeping precepts and the other perfections,
chanting Buddha's name, repentance, training,
and many other kinds of wholesome deeds all find their source in Zazen.
When you sit even once, the merit obliterates countless wrongdoings.
How can there be evil realms?
The pure land is not far.
If by good fortune you have the occasion to hear this teaching,
admire it, and rejoice in it,
you will attain boundless happiness.
How much more if you dedicate yourself and realize your own nature directly.
This own nature is no nature.
You are already apart from useless discussions.
The gate opens where cause and effect are inseparable.
The road of not two, not three, goes straight ahead.
Make the form formless form,
going and returning, not anywhere else.
Make the thought thoughtless thought,
singing and dancing the Dharma voice.
How vast the sky of unobstructed concentration.
How brilliant the full moon of four-fold wisdom.
At this very moment, what can be sought?
Nirvana is immediate.
This place is the lotus land.
This body is the Buddha body.
This teaching of Hakuin, in a sense,
brings up the use of energy, sound, form, and structure.
When sound gets organized, when energy gets moved.
This weekend we did a retreat on Tai Chi.
And still, there's something beyond just moving energy
or just organizing sound.
Something that distinguishes just compulsive,
dead-hearted gesture
from the kind of singing and dancing Dharma voice
that Hakuin talks about.
That distinguishes rote motion
and prose
from the real poetry
and dance of the way
that makes a gesture,
a chant,
capable of healing,
capable of expressing
and manifesting
and resounding through all beings
with wholeness.
It's the nature of liturgy.
It's the nature of the real work.
But it's imperative
that we get clear
on what's missing
in just moving energy around.
There's nothing that makes me personally
more annoyed
than feeling this zendo,
this space that's so dedicated
and has had so much energy given
to waking it up
to see it used
for dead-heartedness.
To feel
the service happen
and look around
and see that half the people
in the room
are somewhere else.
That during Kinhin
we're walking around
as if we're zombies.
That during Zazen
we're nodding off.
It's more than posture.
What alchemy
solves the structure
of the real chemical nature?
What transforms matter
and activity
into the sacred
and tender Dharma
that Hakkowen referred to?
Dogen Zenji taught
if we don't practice it
it doesn't manifest.
If we don't experience it
it can't be realized.
It can't be real.
And Zen training
ceaselessly begs the question
forces the issue
by insisting
on a certain structure.
This is the way to bow.
This is the way
to sit Zazen.
It's physical.
It's specific.
It's now.
And yet
the prime directive
Star Trekkies
of Zen
is the most radical
revolutionary
deconstruction
of all structure.
It's the most dangerous
kind of anarchy.
It says take apart
all of the structure
because
when you look at it
closely enough
you'll see that it's
impermanent.
That even the structure
we call our self
deconstructs.
So what's happening
in insisting on a structure
and insisting on a form
it's the paradox
of training
it's the paradox
of spiritual life
of path
of way
of intention
of vow
and to not
take it up
personally
whether you call it
Zen
or spiritual life
or doing right
or doing right
to not address
the issue
is to miss
the chance
to sing
this life
to realize
the gatha
gatha means song
and it's not
this dharma
is not
necessarily
a pretty
song
it's often
misconstrued
it used to be
that Buddhism
and Zen
was thought of
as misty
mountaintops
polished wood
a kind of
neatness
visually
and there was
a romance
around that
recently we sent
out our
dharma communications
catalog
and we've gotten
a number of
letters back
from people
saying
what an
extraordinarily
technologically
beautiful cover
they don't order
anything
there's no
indication of
them engaging
the practice
contained within
but it's
very pretty
and it's
our birthright
to discover
it
to realize
it
to not
waste
this life
Dogen
Zenji
wrote an
essay called
Bendawa
or Bendawa
in which
he
takes up
this issue
very directly
when the
Buddha
Tathagatas
each having
received the
one to one
transmission
of the
splendid
dharma
experience
the supreme
state of
Bodhi
they possess
a subtle
method
which is
supreme
and without
intention
the reason
only this
method
is transmitted
from Buddha
to Buddha
without deviation
is that
the samadhi
of receiving
and using
the self
is its
standard
for enjoyment
of this
samadhi
the practice
of zazen
in the erect
sitting posture
has been established
as the
authentic gate
this dharma
is abundantly
present in each
human being
but if we do not
practice it
it doesn't manifest
and if we don't
experience it
it can't be
realized
the only
authentic
gate
the only
method
ow
don't you feel
a little reaction
this is a very
intelligent
man
he's not
doing this
without
without some
sense
that it's
going to
irritate
those who
hear it
there are
thorns
there
and beyond
the generally
dangerous
arrogance
of religious
rhetoric
that we find
in all
religious
traditions
this is
the way
this is
the one
truth
there's a
much more
personal
way of
proposing
religious
dogma
or stating
profound
truth
but on a
day to day
moment to
moment
doing what
you're doing
with total
confidence
without
grinding
doubt
the ability
to take the
position
that the
author of
this teaching
takes
is it
possible
to awaken
the place
where there's
no doubt
where we're
not
constantly
thrown
around
by
should I
do
this
or that
is the
grass
greener
over there
would that
practice be
more helpful
more relevant
more complete
more satisfying
would that
work
be a more
direct expression
of
generosity
compassion
clarity
clarity
how do we
use this
teaching
is there
anything
in it
that we
can use
to enable
us to
light up
the dark
paths
that
Hakkowen
pointed to
dark path
after dark
path
dissatisfaction
after dissatisfaction
doubt
after doubt
and then
you die
is there
a path
that isn't
lost
in that
darkness
is there
a way
to pinch
when the
Buddha
Tathagatas
each having
received
the one
to one
transmission
of the
splendid
Dharma
experience
the supreme
state of
Bodhi
they possess
a subtle
method
which is
supreme
and without
intention
a subtle
method
which is
supreme
and without
intention
it sounds
like a
path
without a
goal
if it
has no
intention
is it
a path
at all
Master
Jizo
once asked
Hogan
where do
you come
from
and Hogan
said
I pilgrimage
aimlessly
Hogan
Jizo
said
well what's
the subject
the matter
the subject
matter
various
translations
play with
that
the subject
matter
of your
pilgrimage
and at
that
moment
Hogan
experienced
great
enlightenment
so
how do
we
experience
this great
enlightenment
this splendid
truth
how do
you get
there from
here
how do
we intend
to be
non-intentional
it's kind
of like
really trying
to be
spontaneous
you know
how do
we put
make a
vow
to end
all
desires
Dogen
says
make a
gesture
beyond
the
obvious
have
some
patience
the
Buddha
Tathagata
Tathagata
is one
who has
arrived in
the state
of reality
so when
the ones
who have
arrived in
the state
of reality
each having
received the
one-to-one
transmission of
the splendid
Dharma
experience the
supreme state
of Bodhi
Bodhi is
truth
so when
those who
are living
in reality
those who
have
arrived
they've
received the
one-to-one
transmission
they're clear
they've been
checked out
when those
who have
arrived in
and are
dwelling in
reality
and functioning
one-to-one
when they
experience the
supreme state
of truth
they possess
this subtle
method
supreme and
without
intention
the reason
only this
method is
transmitted from
Buddha to
Buddha without
deviation
is that
the samadhi
of receiving
and using
the self
is its
standard
samadhi
samadhi is
used a lot
of different
ways
throughout the
Shobha Genzo
this masterwork
of Dogen
Zenji's that
this essay
is taken
from
he's got
innumerable
essays
not
innumerable
12 essays
that have
samadhi
in the
title
one is
Hosho
Zanmai
Samadhi
the Dharma
nature
or
Kaiin
Zanmai
Samadhi
a state
like the
sea
the translator
says
samadhi
can be
understood
as the
state
of natural
balance
experienced
when making
effort
without
intentional
aim
okay
so
the reason
only this
method is
transmitted
from Buddha
to Buddha
without
deviation
is that
the natural
state of
balance
experienced
when making
effort
without
intentional
aim
is its
standard
i liked
receiving
and using
the self
as an
even
clearer
expression
of
samadhi
receiving
the self
receiving
for most
people in
practice
there comes
a moment
when you
get that
when you
notice
profoundly
for the
first time
the measure
to which
we're each
supported
and it
varies
among
lives
but i
distinctly
remember
and continue
to drop
back in
i've been
there are
you know
some bare
spots
the samadhi
of receiving
and using
there's a koan
in which
someone sent
out to
find something
that's not
medicine
the teacher
says go
out into
the town
and bring
me back
something
that's not
medicinal
that's not
capable of
healing
and the
student comes
back
having gone
down that
path and
says i
can't find
anything that's
not medicine
and so the
teacher says
well show me
something that
is medicine
and the
student picks
a leaf of
grass
and offers
it to the
teacher who
then uses it
to teach the
assembly
the heart
can open
in the
most unlikely
circumstances
but we have
to be clear
on used
for what
the title
of this
essay
bendawa
is making
an effort
in pursuit
of the
truth
ben means
to make
an effort
do the
truth
wa a
story
so bendawa
is a talk
about pursuing
the truth
or a talk
about the
practice of
zazen
what do we
use our
lives for
not abstractly
what do we
use the
lousy
relationship
for
what do we
use the
health
problem
for
what do we
use the
job
for
what do we
use the
problem
for
what do we
use the
nightly
news
for
no this
is not
the plan
this is not
medicine
everything
received
and used
for
enjoyment
of this
samadhi
the
practice
of
zazen
in the
erect
sitting
posture
has been
established
as the
authentic
gate
and again
this is
this is
probably the
most
potentially
annoying
past
sentence
in the
piece
it's the
authentic
gate
how can
that be
how can
we not
reject
this
statement
immediately
what does
it mean
posture
is the
way to
happiness
true
peace
is found
by crossing
your
legs
anyone
who can't
cross
their
legs
just
can't
get
in
the
gate
is that
the
truth
are you
satisfied
with
that
what's
going
on
what's
the
true
authentic
only
gate
that
leads
to
this
enjoyment
of
samadhi
obviously
it's
this
place
is the
lotus
land
Akowin
said
it's not
about
interpreting
it
or creating
a derivative
variation
on it
it's not
about
understanding
it
he brings
us right
into
the area
of disease
in practice
the ways
in which
we step
away
and we
re-enter
the dark
paths
we become
lax
or we
become
rigid
when we
become
lax
we say
every way
is the
way
everything
everything
I do
is
zen
everything
is true
everything
is equal
in one
sense
this is
a
the
laxity
and the
rigidity
are basic
response
we have
to be
willing
to envision
beyond
the obvious
when
perhaps
you're
punching
you know
five inches
in
you're
not
letting
the
limit
limit
your
mind
these
ways
of
limiting
are
often
genderized
by being
understood
as male
and female
energy
and it's
useful
in a sense
that yin
and yang
understanding
as long as
we don't
lock into
being all
one or
all the
other
or I'm
this and
you're
that
but you
can see
that
laxity
that
passivity
as the
kind of
downside
of the
receptivity
energy
when we
become
lax
there's a
quality
of despair
a kind
of
hopelessness
the
positive
side
of that
receptivity
is that
there's a
recognition
of change
when you're
receiving
you're
open
things are
changing
there's
no
barrier
and women
are often
every
sensibility
shifts
how you
feel yourself
to be
changes
and that
vulnerable
and so
throughout
history
the response
has often
been
to keep
feminine
energy
out of the
public
sphere
because
it's
complex
of
expression
and
allowing
that
to
mature
as it
can
and
find
expression
is
necessary
if we're
to take
care of
this earth
and each
other
and ourselves
be felt
when we
respond to
the unpredictable
when we're
thrust into
the unknown
and the
energy that
comes up
is fearful
rather than
striking out
and to ask
for anything
because fear
is motive
the male
energy
is the
disease of
control
conditioning
that's always
motivating
itself
in that
kind of
vital
to act
regardless
it's an
incredible
weight
that we
put on
beings
and the
energy
quality
that's often
experienced
around that
is anger
I don't
know
but here
do it
this way
it has
the possibility
of stability
strength
structure
usually
involves
a kind
of physical
armoring
where we
tense
we create
a kind
of framework
again
a false
structure
to mobilize
through what's
going on
both
diseases
are dealt
with in
practice
holding
fast
that
structure
this is
it
zazen
is the
only way
it's
this
mountain
not
that
mountain
it's
now
cut
the
crap
of course
we all
have an
equal
say
and since
that's how
music
shapes
itself
that ability
to let
go
and hold
fast
to sustain
when resting
in silence
and passivity
is simply
self-indulgence
and a lack
of courage
and imagination
and a
willingness
to take
a risk
and when
dashing
around
intention
intending
yesterday in
the workshop
he said
after that
this is
this is
very open
because she
trusts me
the implication
being
what about
when the
trust is
not there
the edge
being
what about
when life
pushes us
and we
don't trust
the motivation
how do we
act
dirty
out
but he
the singer
says my
good old
Zen buddies
they think
I'm okay
but I can't
get his
method
his
way
of opening
up the
reality
of
they were
structurally
along with
Bendawa
there's a
number of
people who
are
questioning
Dogen
in the
kind of
motif of
the essay
and giving
him examples
of other
practices
that are
very worthwhile
strong
vigorous
is what's
so excellent
then about
the practice
which you
now solely
recommend to
the exclusion
of these
other
practices
Dogen
says
we need
only know
whether the
practice is
genuine or
artificial
some have
entered into
the stream
of the
Buddha's
truth at
the invitation
of grass
flowers
mountains
and rivers
some have
received and
maintained the
stamp of
Buddha by
grasping
soil
stones
sands
and pebbles
furthermore
the vast
and great
word is
even more
abundant
than the
myriad
phenomena
and the
turning of
the great
Dharma
wheel is
contained in
every molecule
this being
so the
words
mind here
and now
is Buddha
are only
the moon
in water
and the
idea
just to
sit is
to become
Buddha
is also
a reflection
in a
mirror
we shouldn't
be caught
by the
skillfulness
of the
words
now
in
recommending
the
practice
in which
Bodhi
is
directly
experienced
Bodhi
being
truth
I
hope
to
demonstrate
the
subtle
truth
that
the
Buddhist
ancestors
have
transmitted
one to
one
and thus
to make
you
into
people
of the
real
state
of
truth
truth
we need
only
know
whether
the
practice
is
genuine
or
artificial
who
needs
to know
that
becomes
the
question
is it
real
or is it
memorex
the television
asks
are you
copying
what is it
when we
bow
what is it
when we
put on
13th century
Chinese robes
get a zen
haircut
wear a zen
bib
walk in
straight
lines
put a
little carved
doll
in front
of the
room
use pieces
of cloth
wood
ceramic
as religious
items
is it
because
someone
long ago
said
things
that last
tend to
have been
tested
and challenged
if they're
useful
it's been
found out
but fascism
has lasted
lasting
isn't
the whole
litmus test
mind
here and
now
is Buddha
the words
are only
moon
in water
it's an
image of it
it's not
the thing
itself
just to
sit
is to
become
Buddha
is also
a reflection
and it's
easy
you can't
be caught
by the
skillfulness
of words
now in
recommending
the practice
in which
truth is
directly
experienced
that's
the practice
in which
truth is
exactly
it's
directly
experienced
I hope
to demonstrate
the subtle
truth that
the Buddhist
answer
he's
demonstrating
the subtle
truth
by
recommending
zazen
for
transmission
of the
Buddha
Dharma
we must
always
take as
a teacher
a person
who's
experienced
the
Buddhist
state
it's
never
enough
to take
as our
guiding
teacher
a scholar
who counts
words
it would be
like the
blind
leading the
blind
in this
the lineage
of the
authentic
transmission
of the
Buddhist
ancestors
we revere
wise
masters
who have
attained
the truth
and experienced
the state
and we
cause them
to dwell
in a
level on
which we
should
realize
then
Dawa
continues
that living
and dying
is just
nirvana
Buddhists
have never
discussed
nirvana
outside of
living and
dying
moreover
even if we
wrongly
imagine
the understanding
that mind
becomes
eternal
by getting
free of
the body
to be the
same as
the Buddha
wisdom
which is
free of
life and
death
the mind
that is
conscious
of this
understanding
still appears
and disappears
momentarily
so it's
not eternal
at all
then isn't
this understanding
unreliable
we should
taste and
reflect
nirvana
means
outside
the lineage
of the
dharma
which we
the lineage
of the
dharma
which asserts
that the
buddha dharma
that in the
buddha dharma
the essential
state of
mind
universally
includes
all forms
describes
the whole
great world
of dharma
inclusively
without
dividing
essence
and form
and without
discussing
all dharmas
myriad phenomena
and accumulated
things are
totally
just the
one mind
without
exclusion
or disunion
the
practice
is not
confined
to
sitting
itself
it
strikes
we are
pain
and what
cures
pain
we are
the sweet
vowing
to save
all
in what
is
recommended
to
others
vow it
that
the
way
to
have
to
see you
here
