From the Lotus Sutra.
No, Shariputra, I, observing with the Buddha's eyes,
see the creatures in the six states of existence,
poor and without happiness and wisdom,
in the dangerous path of mortality,
in continuous, unending misery,
firmly fettered by the five desires,
like the yak caring for its tail,
smothered by greed and infatuation,
blinded and seeing nothing.
They seek not the Buddha and the law to end sufferings,
but deeply fall into heresies
and seek by suffering to be rid of suffering.
And seek by suffering to be rid of suffering.
I think for a lot of us, first coming into practice,
one of the things that's so striking is
the straight talk
about what on some level we already know to be true.
We talk a lot about suffering.
And this is what the Buddha's talking about here.
And really what he's talking about is
the first wisdom of suffering.
The first of the four noble truths
that suffering is wisdom.
And if you think about it
and kind of imagine
Shakyamuni
having gone through all of the struggling that he had
and the practice
and the pain
and the practice
and the pain
year after year
and then suddenly
seeing
through it all.
I mean, whether you understand
whether we understand that or not
just to get inside of that moment
and then
he begins to teach
and the first thing that he says
is that life is suffering.
And it's kind of incredible that
he didn't speak about
enlightenment.
He didn't say
something about
the inherent perfection
of the universe.
He didn't describe
what he had seen
the way he was free.
But from the very beginning
he was filled with the suffering
of others.
But it's even more incredible
when we start to look at
what that really means
in this teaching.
The word
the Sanskrit word
of course is dukkha.
And it means a lot of different things.
Imperfection
impermanence
insubstantiality
emptiness.
For him to say
that life is suffering
all he's really saying
is that
everything
that doesn't last
hurts.
And that's quite a lot.
There's quite a lot
that's
impermanent.
And of course
the way he came to see this
beginning
with his life
in his
castle
was that
he began
with the reference
system
that life
was permanent.
That happiness
was permanent.
That youth
was permanent.
That health
was permanent.
And then one day
he saw
otherwise.
And
I think about this
about these moments
in history
because you know
all we get
is the
cleaned up version
of what happened.
But
Shakyamuni
was a human being.
And on this ride
with his charioteer
where he saw
for the first time
sickness.
And old age
and death.
The history
that we get
is that he went
home promptly
cut off his hair
and left his wife
and began.
I wonder.
I wonder
if he didn't
fight a little.
Argue a little.
Deny a little.
And in a
very real
sense
this is exactly
what we go through.
beginning with
birth
everything's
perfect
for most
of us.
We're fed.
We're kept
warm.
We're
nourished.
And it's
permanent.
It's
everlasting.
There's no
death.
There's no
aging.
And
that's
all we know.
And then
at some
point
at many
points
along the
way
that begins
to change.
We call it
growing up.
But really
it's
seeing
the Buddha's
teaching.
It's
living the
Buddha's
life.
Those first
moments
everybody
remembers them
where
that dream
about
permanent
happiness
permanent
warmth
begins to
be chipped
away at.
And we
too
go outside
the castle
wall
and for the
first time
begin to
see
sickness.
We begin
to see
how fragile
life
really is.
Vulnerability
I remember
the first
time I saw
my parents
afraid.
It was
cataclysmic.
It was
absolutely
catastrophic
that moment.
The first
time I saw
them cry.
It was
the first
hint that
things weren't
really the
way I
thought they
were.
So this
dukkha
impermanence.
As we
begin to
grow older
there's a
moment at
which we
suddenly
realize
aging.
We
realize
that
we're
getting
older
that
everyone
else
gets
older
and
there's
that
moment
when the
mind's
developed
enough
that we
can
extrapolate
and see
however dimly
that we
will be
at some
point where
our parents
are now
and further.
And then
there's that
first time
when we
encounter
death
in someone
we know.
Going
outside the
castle.
In a sense
you could
say that
at that
moment
our feet
are on
the path.
At that
moment we
realize that
something's
askew.
And the
incredible
thing about
the Buddha's
teaching on
dukkha
the way
suffering
needs to
be
understood
when we
come into
practice we
see it
as something
tangible
visceral.
You know
it's
the thing
that hurts.
but we
don't see
it as
health.
We don't
see it
as
happiness.
We don't
see it
as
samadhi.
We don't
see it
as
accomplishment.
Or as
the path
itself.
And as
we begin
to come
into contact
with these
things
because
we see
them as
something
other than
who we
are.
We fight.
We're
angry,
disappointed.
And that's
where our
training begins
in trying
to stop
that process.
Trying to
control,
manipulate.
We don't
buy it.
We don't
want it.
And of
course that's
what our
that's the
samsara
of our
lifetime.
of our
period in
history is
taking that
further and
further.
It's really
little wonder
that we put
so much
energy into
manipulating
what's
outside of
us,
what we
see so
clearly as
being outside
of us
because
manipulating
the internal
is harder.
And what we're
doing is
exactly what
the Buddha
says.
Seek by
suffering to
be rid of
suffering.
We're using
suffering to
try and put an
end to
suffering.
But not in the
way that we
teach in Zen,
not in the way
that we
practice.
and all
this suffering
really is,
is not
seeing things
as they
are.
The name
for the
Buddha,
Tathagata,
one thus
come.
What is
that?
And the
only thing
that gets
in the way
of all of
this is
the self.
It's the
only thing.
the idea
that we
are.
That the
idea that
when in
that first
moment we
experience
something
painful,
we experience
our first
loss.
The idea
that it's
not who
we are.
In that
moment is
born.
This first
of the
Buddhist
teaching.
And in
Zen,
in
Buddhism,
we
understand
the
self
as being
composed of
five
aggregates.
We chant
it every
morning in
the Heart
Sutra.
Form,
sensation,
conception,
discrimination,
awareness.
And form
includes not
only the
tools of
perception,
the sense
organs,
but also the
objects of
perception,
which means
everything.
Sensations,
pleasant,
unpleasant,
neutral.
Conception,
the thinking
mind.
Discrimination,
seeing that
there is an
outside.
And
awareness,
the witness.
This is how we
convince ourselves
that we do
exist.
There's proof.
Moment to
moment.
Buddha says,
the poor and
without happiness
and wisdom
treading on
the dangerous
path of
mortality.
Well,
death
is just a
fact of
life.
Isn't it?
So it
sounds like
he's saying
something
about
mortality,
but isn't
to deny
that,
not seeing
things as
they are.
What does
he mean?
The
dangerous
path of
mortality.
He could
have said
the dangerous
path of
the self.
The
dangerous
path of
separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
Separation.
And it's
easy when we
read
these old
texts like
this to
see them
as
archaic.
But
they're
not.
This
dangerous
path of
mortality,
everyone who
walks in
here as
a student
acknowledges
that.
I come
here realizing
the problem
of life
and death
is a
vital
matter.
In
continuous
unending
misery.
Firmly
fettered by
the five
desires.
Like the
yak caring
for its
tail.
Smothered
by greed
and infatuation.
Blinded
and seeing
nothing.
The
first time
I read
this I
thought,
God,
that's
a
description
of a
really
sorry
person.
But
if you
really
look at
it,
it's
us.
It's
me.
Continuous
unending
misery.
Continuous
unending
suffering.
Impermanence.
Separation.
Moment
after
moment.
How?
Fettered by
the five
desires.
That's all
we have to
go on.
Those are
our tools.
smothered
by greed
and infatuation.
Smothered
by greed
is just
simply
believing
that
we are
who we
think we
are.
The incredible
thing about
this is that
it's not a
negative
statement.
It sounds
so negative,
but it's
not.
What the
Buddha is
doing is
he's just
seeing,
he's saying
what is.
To seek
by suffering
to be rid
of suffering.
In a
sense we
can say
that the
problem
begins
with
seeking.
Because we're
looking for
something.
We want to
get away
from something.
We want to
go somewhere.
and that's
not going
to happen.
Juman
yesterday
talked about
simplicity.
That's what
that is.
And it's
difficult
because we
just don't
buy it.
And it's
the greatest
irony
that as
we practice
what we
see
again
and again
again
and again
is that
where we're
going
is where
we are.
Seeking
by suffering.
One of the
things we
use is
numbing.
Alcohol,
drugs,
entertainment,
excitement,
sex.
I was
talking to
a fellow
who spent
some time
here a
couple weeks
ago and
he said
he came
from a
family,
a neighborhood
that just
for whom
this is
inconceivable
from down
in the
city.
And he
said he
has none
of the
vocabulary
and he
said you
know what
I really
want
is I
want to
feel the
way I
used to
feel
when I
was on
drugs all
the time.
And he
said not
the altered
reality,
not
hallucinations,
but just
feeling
no pain.
I thought
about a
story I
read,
science
fiction many
years ago
about a
fellow who
built a
happiness
machine.
And it
was like a
box,
like a
phone booth
and you
walk in
and you
sit down.
And
just a
barrage of
smells and
sounds and
sights and
touches.
You're in
Paris and
Venice and
cornfields and
flowers and
all of it,
just inundated.
Everything
wonderful,
everything
beautiful.
and the
guy who
made this
machine tried
it out on
his family and
all of his
friends and
everybody came
out just
sobbing
uncontrollably,
crying,
crying,
so sad.
And he
couldn't
understand until
finally he
did it and
it was
wonderful and
it was
beyond
everything he
imagined
possible.
Until that
instant when
he realized,
when he
remembered that
it would
end.
Another thing
we use to
seek is
responsibility,
having a
cause.
We throw
ourselves into
our work,
to our
careers,
and we
use it to
hide,
to forget,
to forget the
problem.
we use it
to feel like
we're taking
care of
things,
that we're
going somewhere.
I was
driving somewhere
recently on
the highway
and I
passed a
speed limit
sign,
said 55,
and you know
it's incredible
because nobody
goes 55
anymore.
and I
guess I
was going
about 65
and people
were just
flying by.
I
remembered that
when the
speed limit
had changed
to 55
originally,
everybody
basically went
55 and
there would
be those
few people
who would
fly by.
Now it's
like everybody
understands that
it's, let's
say, 65 and
there's still
those few
people who
fly by.
I thought
probably no
matter what
the speed
limit,
there would
be those
people who
it needed
to be
more.
And it's
that sense
of going
somewhere.
Responsibility.
For residents
it's easy for
that to
become part
of our
Zazen
practice.
We have a
job, it's
important,
we have a
responsibility
to the
monastery
and we
bring it
into the
Zendo.
It's not
great, but
it's important
that we
do our
job.
Wrong.
That's not
taking
responsibility
of our
job.
It's also
interesting to
see during
Hosan
how difficult
it can be
to practice,
how difficult
it can be
for some
of us
to stop,
to stop
working.
I feel
like I
know this
very well.
There were
times when
Kyoto or
Dairoshi
would come
in and
say,
get out!
And I
would kind
of laugh
and say,
I'll be
out in a
few minutes.
But they'd
say, no,
now.
And I
didn't
understand
because I
was taking
care of
my job.
What was
it that I
needed to
do?
What
wasn't that
I couldn't
do?
Seeking
suffering.
Seeking by
suffering to
be rid of
suffering.
One of
the tools
that we're
given as
we grow
up is
accomplishment.
Degrees
and
skills.
It's like
certification
that we
have
mastered
our life.
The bottom
line, of
course, is
that we
want to
guarantee.
We want
to promise.
We want
someone to
say, if
you do
this,
it will
be thus.
During the
year before
I moved
in here,
at which
point there
were a lot
of things
coming together
to lead
me to
that, I
was speaking
to my
uncle, a
man that I
never particularly
cared for
very much,
but we
were family.
He was
getting ready
to retire
65 years.
He'd
worked right
out of high
school into
a factory
in New
Jersey.
With very
little education,
he started
out sweeping
floors, and
he busted
his ass,
worked and
worked and
worked, and
ended up in
some kind of
middle-level
management
position, and
spent probably
close to 50
years in this
one factory.
And I
remember talking
to him about
his retiring,
and I said,
God, I bet
you're going to
be kind of
sad to leave.
And he
kind of
snapped at
me, and
he said,
are you
kidding?
I can't
wait to
get out.
He said,
now I'm
going to
start to
live.
This is
when my
life begins.
And he
retired, and
six months
later, he
was dead.
And up to
the very
end, the
very last
thing he
said was,
when I get
home, we'll
iron this all
out.
Guarantees.
And the
thing that we
get into, the
problem that we
have, is that
we see these
things as the
problem itself.
So that we
sometimes think
that we need to
get rid of what
we have in our
life.
Or we may
just feel a
little guilty
about it.
And that's
dividing.
that's dividing
the sacred
from the
mundane.
The Buddha
nature is
everywhere.
All things.
All times.
The problem
is not
responsibility
or being
numb or
having
accomplished
ourself.
And the
same thing
happens in
practice.
Liturgy
tends to
foster a
kind of
attachment
to form.
Koan
study tends
to foster
competitiveness.
And the way
some teachers
centers deal
with this is
by getting
rid of it.
What a
tragedy.
The fact
is that it's
true, too.
Liturgy
does foster
attachment.
Koan
study does
tend to
create
competitiveness.
And it
is extremely
easy to
become
dependent
upon the
teacher.
So what
do we do
when we
get rid
of it?
We get
rid of the
opportunity
to find
out what
the source
of attachment
is.
We can't
put an
end to
suffering
unless we
have
suffering.
We need
something to
work with.
I was
talking with
a resident
recently and
they were
telling me
about the
friction that
they were
feeling with
another resident.
And I
thought,
isn't that
wonderful?
Isn't that
wonderful that
the Sangha
works?
Isn't it
wonderful that
we actually
have something
to practice?
It's
important that
we see
that the
cause of
our
suffering
is not
form,
sensation,
conception,
discrimination,
awareness.
It's the
way the
mind sees
it.
The Buddha
talks about
being firmly
fettered by
the five
desires.
We talk
about greed,
anger,
and ignorance
being the
three poisons.
Last Tuesday
when we
began
Dango,
Taito
Sensei
bit the
heads off
of most
of the
residents.
He was
angry!
A few
days before
that,
at the
tenth year
anniversary,
he cried.
Is this
being fettered
by the
five desires?
Is this
being controlled
by the
three poisons?
What is
this different
way of
using the
mind that
we keep
talking about?
We talk
about
using
suffering
to put
an end
to
suffering.
That's
the way
we practice
and it's
a way of
using the
mind.
Muman
calls it
the
gateless
gate.
The
parallel
of our
practice
with the
Buddha's
practice
doesn't
end
on just
leaving the
castle.
The Buddha
and every
enlightened
person
or
unenlightened
person who
practiced
since his
lifetime
experienced
exactly what
we experience.
It's
extraordinary
when you
sit on the
cushion
and your
legs hurt.
That's
Shakyamuni's
pain.
He felt
it.
He
practiced
it.
It's
Rinzai's
pain,
Dogen's
pain,
Daito
Sensei's
pain.
No one
gets out
of that.
No one's
exempt.
So what's
the difference
between them
and us?
There is
no difference.
We call it
practice and
verification.
Practicing
the practice
of the
Buddha
and making
his
words
our
words.
Not
teachings.
Not
something
someone
said.
Suddenly
forgetting
all the
teachings
and seeing
it there
in front.
That's
the only
thing that
counts.
And there's
not a
person in
this room
that can't
do that.
but
it.
They want
to
see you
higher
who
and
you
You
