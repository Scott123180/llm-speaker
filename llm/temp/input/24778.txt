Each one is the gigantic body.
There is no place to put it.
Each one is finer than an atom,
smaller than a speck,
a dust moat and a ray of passing sun.
Releasing is up to this one.
Holding fast depends on this one.
But say, who is that?
To untie the knot,
simply sweep away all the dust of mental diversion.
Bright and clear,
the myriad sounds and forms are spontaneously illuminated.
The open road has opened,
and no creature fails to cover the ground on which it stands.
Girl Meets Insect,
A Story My Teacher Tells
The caterpillar said,
One side will make you grow bigger,
and the other side will make you grow smaller.
One side of what?
Thought Alice to herself.
Of the mushroom, said the caterpillar.
Alice looked at the mushroom,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it,
as it was perfectly round.
Verse,
The single body revealed is not like anything.
To free it,
free the mind.
She rides bareback and backwards on the old ox,
into blue mountains,
endlessly unfolding,
blue piled upon blue.
We're going to talk this morning
a little bit about perfection.
Perfection of the way,
of our lives,
and the ways we subvert perfection into perfectionism,
and thus turn our lives into suffering.
This weekend we're completing a retreat on Zen and the Twelve Steps,
the Zen of the recovery movement.
One of the things that occurred to me in reading the book
and overhearing some of the work that was done this weekend
is the nature of resistance,
the mediums that we all use to stop life from changing colors on us,
the kinds of wax that we put on the dye cloth of our lives,
the hard, thick junk that we pile onto the cloth,
and it creates our patterns, our habits,
sense of our personality.
And while the wax is on there really thick,
everything feels awkward.
The movement of the cloth is pretty stymied.
Wind and water can't create much of a wave.
And yet we often don't get what the real problem is.
The problem is not conditioning.
It's the decisions we make about the conditioning we've experienced.
As a child,
I was often yelled at for forgetting things.
I grew up aware of the fact eventually that I was tense
throughout my body whenever I forgot anything.
But we're all conditioned.
And under the influence of these incidents,
we slowly revise over time our idea of who we are
into the genuinely open spaciousness of who we actually are.
We decide that what we are is the lump of wax,
the contracted ball of fear.
And we rewrite the world.
Maybe we comply with it.
Maybe we rebel.
Maybe we withdraw.
But regardless,
we're deciding on some level
to fulfill the contracted small picture
of who I am
in order to survive.
And that idea
can be of imperfection.
I'm not good enough.
Or it can be of perfection.
The world doesn't recognize
or appreciate
my basic goodness.
But the decisions,
regardless,
are based on an idea.
Fortunately,
because those decisions
are made up of thought
and embodied intention,
they can teach us.
They can teach us
when we're aware,
right here and right now,
of our experience in the present moment.
Intellectually,
being aware
of our conditioning
may or may not be helpful.
Sometimes it is.
Sometimes it doesn't do anything.
What is helpful
is knowing what thoughts
we persist in creating
right now
and what bodily holdings
of tension we have
right now.
Bhadmasambhava said,
if you want to know
your past life,
look into
your present condition.
If you want to know
your future life,
look at your present action.
So we need to notice
the thought.
We need to experience
the body directly.
This is doing zazen.
This is the melting of the wax
and the freeing ourselves
of fear
as we notice.
Notice the false identification
with the limited idea of self.
The self that was born
in those early decisions.
And as we notice,
that false self begins to fade.
We can be more and more
what we actually are.
No self.
Then the cloth begins to move
with every bit of wind,
every motion of water.
There's a sense of openness,
of generosity,
of spaciousness.
Why?
Because the cloth
and the wind
have never been two things.
Because our lives
and the waves
that come through
are not separate.
But it's important
not to believe this.
Believing is going to kill you.
All that matters
is to go directly.
Each one is the gigantic body.
There's no place to put it.
Each one is finer than an atom,
smaller than a speck,
a dust moat,
an array of passing sun.
Releasing is up to this one.
Holding fast
depends on this one.
But say,
who is that?
To untie the knot,
simply sweep away
all the dust
of mental diversion.
Bright and clear,
the myriad sounds
and forms
are spontaneously illuminated.
The open road is opened
and no creature
fails to cover the ground
on which it stands.
This gigantic body,
it's important to see
why there's no place
to put it.
This was an important teaching
for me.
My monastic name
is Tashu,
which means
pervading everywhere,
which I immediately
turned into,
the great fat woman.
so what is this body
that pervades everywhere?
Why can't you put it anywhere?
Where could you stand
to see something
that pervades everywhere?
How could it go
from here to there?
It's already there.
You're already there.
This is the truth
of our wholeness.
The unity that we're always
scrambling to create
or to find
is always right under our feet.
But if this is an abstraction
or a bunch of mystical hoopla,
it's important to check
for yourself.
Where do you end?
Where's the limit
to your body?
I was reading recently
a story about
the work of Mother Teresa.
It was in a book
called Healing Words
by Larry Dossi.
He was reporting
on a study
that they did
where they took
two groups of physicians.
And one group
of physicians
thought Mother Teresa
was
the cat's pajamas,
great stuff,
good work,
we're lucky
she's in the world.
They agreed,
in other words,
with her way
of work and life.
And the other group
basically had issues.
They disagreed.
They thought it was
a bunch of do-goodness,
that it wasn't
answering the real problems,
that there was some
Catholic delusion going on,
whatever.
There was some issue.
There was a sense of distance
and disagreement.
And they took both
of these groups
and they measured
the amount of
immunoglobulin.
I think it was
in the saliva,
which is an indicator
of the immune system,
the strength
of the immune system.
And they got the figures
and then they showed
both groups
a film
of Mother Teresa
doing her work,
physically just out there
taking care.
And then they re-ran
the test.
They checked
the strength
of the immune system
of both groups.
in both study groups,
the immunoglobulin level
or whatever it was,
I may say that wrong,
was heightened.
The immune system
was dramatically
strengthened.
How does that work?
What's the limit
of the body?
What's our impact
on what we call
one another?
Who are we?
How big is this body?
Whitman wrote
in Song of Myself,
If you want me again,
look for me
under your boot soles.
Finer than an atom,
smaller than a speck,
a dust moat
in a passing ray of sun.
Is this small?
Is it large?
The reality
of the non-dual
kicks language
all around.
Language goes
around the block.
As soon as we make
an object,
then we've left
the heart
of the non-dual.
We've separated
self from it.
Dogen wrote,
The Buddha Dharma
cannot be understood
by a person.
And the implication
here of person
is important.
All dharmas,
all beings,
the teachings say,
are ultimate reality,
the one body.
They are
the appearance
of Buddha.
So when we take
a person
and say,
that's one who thinks,
who speculates,
who analyzes,
who compares
self with other,
we're in dichotomy.
Buddha's not an object
object to be achieved
or understood.
Perfection
can't be attained.
Enlightenment
can't be attained.
Because there's no object,
there are 10,000 universes
in a speck of dust.
Indra's net,
which is an ancient metaphor
for the nature
of reality,
the way of talking
about what's so difficult
to talk about
without destroying
its heart,
is a way of accessing
this that can seem
abstraction.
In this description,
it said that
the god Indra
wanted to make
a thing
of great beauty
that would reflect
on his power
and understanding,
an act
of great generosity.
He decided
to construct
a net
that would reach
throughout space
and time
in all dimensions.
and he spoke
to the jewel master
of his kingdom
and said,
I want to make
this a really fine net.
Do we have any jewels
that we could put
at the nexus point
of each place
the net crosses itself?
And they checked
the basement
and said,
yeah,
we've got an infinite
number of diamonds
down here.
We're ready.
And so they constructed
this tremendous net
and the most
remarkable thing
about this net
was that as you
took up each diamond
at each nexus point,
each place
on the net,
within that diamond
you could see
every other diamond
in the entirety
of the net
throughout past,
present,
and future
reflected perfectly.
And as you would
see that reflection
within it,
you'd see
every other diamond
infinitely reflected
so that at each
point in the net
all of reality
was present.
And this metaphor
was then
tucked away
in Buddhist literature
as a beautiful
but again
abstract
description
of reality.
And then
a number of years ago
when holographic photography
was developed
they discovered
an amazing thing
which was when you
take a holographic image,
a three-dimensional image
with laser light
and cut the image
in half
and then shine
the light back
through that image.
Both halves contain
the entirety
of the image.
and if you cut
those halves
and half again
those quarters
contain the entirety
of the image
everything's present
it's a little dimmer
but it's all there.
And you can do that
infinitely
small pieces
of that image.
And so here
represented
in physical reality
is the metaphor
of that diamond net.
is the reality
of our lives
that each one
of us
each position
each place
each one
contains
the entirety
of the universe.
But what are
the implications?
We say
it's up to this one
the releasing
the holding fast.
is this
the higher
deeper
power
that AA
refers to
the one
it all depends on.
This isn't
other
than
during our
morning service
when we say
whenever this
devoted invocation
is sent forth
it's perceived
and subtly
answered.
Is this
a distant
God?
Is this
a power
that's either
outside
or inside?
The key
to realizing
this is seeing
what a devoted
invocation
is.
When it's
complete
when that
devotion
doesn't have
a gap
isn't held
back
one iota
when what's
invoked
in that
phrase
that sound
that mind
is
100%
then where's
the object?
where's
the outside?
It pervades
everywhere
and this
is why
where the
question
comes from
the answer
comes from
where is
that?
releasing
releasing
and holding
fast
are
often
described
as ways
that Zen
teachers
work
releasing
being giving
generosity
support
holding
fast
being denying
ignoring
rejecting
and it's
it is a way
that teachers
work
but it's
also the way
life works
so teachers
again
are simply
making fools
of themselves
and making
a big deal
out of the
process
that's ongoing
so that we
become
conscious
at one
moment
there's
support
relationship
comfort
reinforcement
giving
another
moment
we're alone
there's no
one else
there's no
where else
complete
solitude
now the
wisdom
of that
solitude
is the
one body
and the
compassion
of that
relationship
is the
numberless
hands and
eyes of
great
compassion
appearing
whenever
there's a
need
but in
order for
this to
become
personal
we have
to look
at where
we fall
away
where we
build up
tear
down
someone once
wrote
you have
to have
been
inflated
in order
to feel
punctured
and this
is one
of the
ways
holding
fast
and letting
go
reveals
our
minds
recently
in my
own work
I faced
a place
with this
and it's
subtle
the places
that we
hook
and develop
an idea
my teacher
said to me
in response
to
an incident
in which
my response
was to
essentially
let go
to support
to forgive
that
it was a
very good
thing that
I'd never
had children
a cruel
thing to
say
to a
nun
who has
no children
and from
his position
it was
completely
wise
it wasn't
something
that he
was doing
to help
me
it was a
simple reaction
to a simple
situation
but what
happened
with me
was a
whole
panorama
of emotional
response
and aversion
and suffering
and a
seeing
of a
very real
addiction
to being
helpful
to being
kind
to the
idea of
what mother
is
and the
work was
revealed
who can
release
this
who can
use it
where does
it arise
we can
use these
things or
we can
resist
we can
lay down
the wax
we can
refuse to
feel
what's going
on
and make
a jump
step
into being
holy
with it
it can
hurt
to be
real
this is
not
news
what happens
though in
spiritual
practice
is we
begin to
develop
spiritual
ideas
we say
not this
emotion
mature
people
don't feel
this fear
spiritual
people
don't cry
tears
like
parents
are
strong
and so
we begin
to reject
the moment
or we
say not
this body
not this
way
whether it's
an amputated
leg
or a
cold
we begin
to want
it a
different
way
we say
not this
circumstance
my childhood
means
I can't
do this
now
my lover
left
I can't
function
I feel
X
therefore
Y
the Dharma
pervades
everywhere
it's easy
to say
it pervades
even the
thought
but it
doesn't
pervade
everywhere
now we
know that
and knowing
doesn't help
it
we have
to turn
back to
the moment
doing that
our focus
and our
samadhi
deepens
we turn
away from
the fantasy
we turn
away from
the personal
sweet dream
into the
reality
of the
present
moment
it doesn't
have to
feel
any
particular
way
but it
needs to
be real
it needs
to be
this
body
not an
idea
of what
a mature
person
looks like
or what
a monk
does
and feels
or what
a zen
practitioner
should be
capable
about
what do
you feel
what's the
thought
Joko Beck
has written
practice can
be stated
very simply
stating is
never difficult
it's moving
from a life
of hurting
myself and
others
to a life
of not
hurting
myself and
others
that seems
so simple
except when
we substitute
for real
practice
some idea
that we
should be
different
or better
than we
are
or that
our lives
should be
different
from the
way they
are
when we
substitute
our ideas
about what
should be
such
notions as
I should
not be
angry
or confused
or unwilling
for our
life as it
truly is
then we're
off base
and our
practice is
barren
and that's
a powerful
word
and for
most of
it's a
place where
we've
wasted a
lot of
time trying
to cultivate
fake grass
the pretty
picture
the first
stage in
practice
and
beginner's
mind is
never
harmful
the first
stage
is to
recognize
that we're
not running
in place
we're trying
to run
away
we're always
thinking about
how our
lives might
be or how
they once
were
what is
there in
our life
right now
that we
don't want
to run
in place
with
whatever is
repetitive
or dull
or painful
or miserable
we don't
want to run
in place
with that
no
indeed
and so
what happens
is we
create a
false
picture
in the
prologue
I wrote
constantly
sweep away
all the dust
to untie
the knot
all the dust
of mental
diversions
there are two
famous verses
about a
mirror
and a life
that's clear
composed
composed
so that
the fifth
ancestor
could judge
whether the
two people
who were
writing the
poems
had a
true
realization
whether they
really come
home
one was
by a monk
one of his
students who
was quite
accomplished
and well
known to
him
and another
was by an
unknown
visitor
at the
monastery
someone who
whose
understanding
and practice
wasn't as
familiar
to the
group
and the
first monk
wrote
the body
is the
tree of
Bodhi
Bodhi
is that
which wants
to awaken
the mind
is like the
stand of a
mirror bright
or a
bright mirror
moment by
moment
wipe the
mirror
carefully
never let
dust
collect
on it
and the
fifth
ancestor
thought this
was a
decent
verse
but that
it didn't
present the
depth
of reality
and this
unknown
practitioner
presented
another
verse
said Bodhi
is not
originally a
tree
nor is
the bright
mirror
a stand
originally
there's
nothing
so where
can any
dust
collect
Bodhi
is not
originally
a tree
there's
nothing
growing
nothing
changing
nor has
the bright
mirror
a stand
it's not
supported
by anything
originally
there's
nothing
where can
dust
collect
so the
first monk
is saying
that practice
is polishing
removing the
dust of our
diluted thoughts
and ideas
so that we
can shine
so that we
can be
perfected
and pure
purified
the other
is saying
that from the
beginning
there's no
thing
there's no
separation
it's all
one body
there's nowhere
for anything
to go
the paradox
is
that we
have to
practice
the failed
verse
the rejected
verse
the secondary
verse
we have to
polish
the mirror
we have to
be aware
of our
thoughts
our actions
all the
false
reactions
all the
minor
decisions
that we
make
about
who we
are
because
it's only
then
that we
begin to
see
that from
the beginning
our fears
were illusory
something
with smoke
it's a reflection
but we
don't see
that
unless we
relentlessly
practice
practice
of the
non-dual
that in
order
someone
on the
internet
I'm
by the way
cyber
monk
and
revealed
someone
on the
internet
asked
the
other
day
what's
the
difference
between
doing
acid
and
doing
zazen
and
I said
consider
the
difference
between
going
on a
trip
where
do you
find
yourself
on the
idea
level
obviously
nothing
needs
doing
there's
no
sweeping
or
polishing
required
and it's
easy
to sound
zen
and to
create
some real
profound
sounding
mystical
poetry
about
practices
irrelevant
and the
clear
seeing
self
illumination
it's
easy
as our
teacher
often
points out
to be
up to
our
nostrils
and shit
and when
asked
how are
you
mine
but to
know
in our
guts
the truth
of this
life
that yes
from the
beginning
nothing
was lacking
nothing's
needed
life
is
wondrous
and perfect
and open
and to
not kid
ourselves
about the
degree
and
ceaselessness
of sincere
practice
that's necessary
to bring that
to life
that's our
work
for that
to be
invulnerable
to argument
clear
is the
blinking
of our
own
eyes
not
depending
on anyone
the bug
the caterpillar
said
one side
will make
you grow
bigger
and the
other side
will make
you grow
smaller
one side
of what
thought
Alice
to herself
of the
mushroom
said the
caterpillar
Alice
looked at
the mushroom
trying to
make out
which were
the two
sides
of it
as it
was
perfectly
round
and in one
sense this is
about the
search for the
right response
the perfect
presentation
and the
barriers that
creates
let me give
the miraculously
helpful talk
this side
doesn't reach
it
that side
doesn't reach
it
neither this
nor that
misses it
both this
and that
is ten
thousand miles
from the
truth
avoid the
slightest trace
of right
and wrong
and say
a word
wanting to
do the
perfect
thing
we forget
to just
be who
we are
and then
we're lost
and everywhere
we look
we see
failure
because you
can't
create right
without
creating wrong
they arise
together
one side
will make
you grow
bigger
we want
to get
bigger
because we
decided
we're
small
in a movie
that's recently
out about
a woman
who's an
alcoholic
she's speaking
to a group
meeting
and says
when I left
my husband
I said
he made me
feel small
and worthless
so I had to
be alone
but I did
that for
myself
we do
that
for ourselves
so we
resist
the one
thing
that we
can count
on
life
being
as it is
and we
puff up
this big
balloon
image
we're ready
for the
Macy's
parade
and we're
tense
as all
get out
because the
wind is
knocking this
image around
and perhaps
it looks
entertaining
perhaps it's
intimidating
but we
know
there's a
couple people
with thin
little strings
down on the
street
struggling
to not
lose it
moment
by moment
and any
strong gust
of wind
is going
to reveal
the whole
charade
we take
on any
ism
any role
any position
and attach
ourselves
to it
I'm a
mother
I'm a
Zen
student
this is
Buddhism
I'm a
rebel
I'm a
whore
and you
can begin
if you
wake up
the slightest
bit
to feel
the tension
of that
lie
because in
reality
which is
awareness
itself
the shadow
of the
big balloon
can be
released
it's
unnecessary
and we're
not big
and we're
not small
and we're
not helpful
and we're
not useless
and we're
not conditioned
and we're
not free
that we
can
engage
in
bigging
we can
eat the
right foods
we can
pump up
our muscles
we can
say incredibly
wise
things
but still
there's dust
on the
mirror
still we
die
we can't
grow
into
Buddhahood
we're
already
there
yet the
work
remains
the moment
remains
George
Carlin
used to
say
everybody
let's
get
small
instead
of let's
get
hot
let's
get
small
one of
the
dilemmas
is that
even
humility
isn't
small
enough
there's
still
the
self
idea
there's
still
let me
bow
lower
than
you
let me
be less
than
you
let me
be kinder
and gooder
than
you
and we
forget
as we
put
ourselves
down
that it
takes
just
the same
amount
of ego
self
idea
self
we
don't
have
to
remember
how to
be
compassionate
we
don't
have
to
figure
it
out
we
don't
have
to
understand
the
open
road
is
opening
here
now
don't
think
about
it
enter
it
the
things
that we
call
problems
and
imperfections
this
and that
need
our
breath
they
don't
need us
to fix
them
they
need
us
to
breathe
the
distance
and the
coolness
of astute
analysis
are not
going to
bring us
home
we
sit
within
them
the
poor
relationship
the
shift
in our
health
the
unsatisfying
work
and we
sit
aware
breath
after
breath
and
from
that
clear
decisions
arise
based
in
what's
real
in
our
experience
this
is
the
spontaneously
illuminating
light
doesn't
belong to
somebody
else
the
single
body
revealed
is not
like
anything
to
free

completely

to

in

we
need
to
do
what
Whitman
so
beautifully
implores
people to
do at
the
beginning
of
leaves
of
grass
he
says
love
the
earth
and
the
sun
and
the
animals
despise
riches
give
alms

everyone
that
asks
stand

your

hate
tyrants

or in

there's
no end

not this
practice
no
no one
fails
doganra

not
get
satisfied
with
the

moves
like
lightning
you
fail
to
follow
when
the

descends
from the

you
have
no
time
to
cover
your

the
scarlet
banner
flutters
over
the
master's
head
the

sword
it's
the
sword
that
kills
the
ego
and
gives
life
the
two

sword
is
being
brandished
behind
the
student's
neck
now
unless
your

your

how
can
you
cope
with
the

one

lower
his
head

ponder
following
the
delusive
ways

haunted
by

I
want
to
ask
you
without
falling
into
the
delusive
ways
of
thinking
and
without
halting
irresolutely
how
