The Book of Equanimity, Case 33, Sun Cheng's Golden Fish, Preface to the Assembly.
Meeting the strong, be weak. Meeting the soft, be hard.
If both are hard and hit each other, there will surely be one damaged.
But tell me, how do you interchange the main case?
Sun Cheng asked Xuefeng, the golden fish that's passed through the net, what does it use for food?
Xuan Feng said, when you come out of the net, I'll tell you.
Xuan Cheng said, the teacher of 1,500 people and yet you don't even know a saying?
Xuan Feng said, my tasks as abbot are many.
The verse.
When first ascending the tears of waves, clouds and thunder accompany.
Leaping up magnificently, look at the great function.
With burnt tail, he clearly crosses the gate of you.
The beautiful fish won't agree to be sunk in a pickle jar.
An old, mature man does not startle the crowd.
Someone used to facing great adversary has no fear from the start.
Floating, floating, just as light as five ounces.
Massive, massive, heavier than even a thousand tons.
San Cheng's, exalted fame over the four seas.
Who again was his peer?
Shen Feng stands alone.
The eight winds blowing do not move him.
We're in our third full day of Se Shin now.
Third day on is part of Se Shin.
It gets lighter and lighter.
After all the extra begins to fall away.
It's reminded me of, I think it was Michelangelo,
who said that, when asked about his sculpture, creating his sculpture,
and he said he doesn't create it.
He just exposes the image that's already inside the stone right from the beginning.
He discovers the image.
She chips away the extra that hides the image.
Se Shin are about.
In the beginning of Se Shin is all that turmoil that we usually bring to it.
Little by little each day, the stuff falls away.
In the beginning, we get closer and closer to that image inside of each of us.
The good of nature.
The unborn.
The un-extinguished.
But on the surface, all of it keeps changing.
Up one day, down the next day.
Un-extinguished.
Un-permanent.
Constantly.
In a state of becoming.
Nothing fixed.
It's what we call the cycle of life and death.
Being caught in that cycle of life and death is due to ignorance.
Ignorance of a true nature.
Once you begin the process, and really put yourself into it,
begins to appear, as it's always been.
It's always been there.
It's hidden.
Sometimes it's confusing.
On one side, we talk about impermanence.
The constant state of becoming.
And on the other hand, we say that when the world is destroyed,
it is not destroyed.
What is it that survives the destruction of the universe?
Basically, what we're talking about is this golden carp.
A golden carp is a big goldfish, is what it is.
It's the ones that are held in very high regard by the Japanese.
But they're basically a carp.
And the gold one is the golden carp.
And the golden carp is kind of like the student.
And somewhere along the journey,
and it goes back to an old Chinese legend,
it said that King Yu,
there was a gate called King Yu's Gate,
and it was a triple-tiered falls, waterfalls, quite high,
that the carp would come up that river
in the third month
to come to this Yu Gate, or Dragon Gate, it's called.
And of course, what they have to do is swim upstream
against the current.
And once they get to the falls,
they have to leap the falls.
And the ones that manage to leap the falls
are transformed into dragons.
The way they're transformed into dragons,
as they leap into the air,
the bolt of lightning comes and singes their tail.
And at that moment, they're transformed into dragons.
And of course, the dragon is an enlightened being.
And immediately, the dragon follows the wind
and rides the clouds, free, in the ten directions.
And that struggle up the river
is what our practice is all about.
I don't know if you've ever seen the salmon do it,
the shad do it.
In a couple of weeks, we'll see blossoming.
I saw this morning, yesterday was the first day of springs.
This morning, when I was going back,
there were the robins.
I need to follow the calendar.
They weren't here the day before.
They're here today.
And in a few weeks, we'll see the shad trees
along this mountain, along the river,
begin to bloom.
They have white blossoms.
When those shad trees begin to bloom,
the shad begin running up the rivers.
They've returned now, even to the Hudson River.
For years, they were gone because of the pollution.
They just didn't come.
And I think after 20 years,
they cleaned up the river.
And suddenly, the shad are coming.
But how do they know that?
And it's always the same ones.
They always return to their place of birth.
So, the ones coming up to Hudson
are several generations removed.
More than several.
I mean, 20 years.
20 generations removed.
And the ones that would come
wouldn't be able to get up the river
in 20 years, I don't know where they went.
But now, they're coming back up the river.
Many times, canoeing down the Delaware River,
when you hit the shallow parts of the river,
and sometimes you have to walk the canoe,
you see the shad coming up.
And they're a pretty good-sized fish.
Foot and a half long, some of them two feet.
All torn to pieces by the current.
I mean, they go through incredible rapids.
And when they go through the shallows,
sometimes it's not deep enough
for them to swim in.
So, basically, what they're doing
is crawling over rocks.
Half of their bodies are out of the water.
And they're leaping and crawling.
Their skin is shredded and bleeding.
And all along the way,
you'll see some that don't make it.
They're just declining.
You get up close to the top of the river.
You see them coming.
I mean, just.
They have to get up there to lay these eggs.
After they do that, they die.
And then the next generation takes off.
Kind of a very powerful image.
You see that incredible force of nature
fulfilling one's karma.
And the karma of all sentient beings
and all sentient beings
is realization.
It's to realize ourselves.
It's to transform ourselves.
That's what it's about.
The possibility exists,
but millions of people
don't even know
live their life of pain and suffering
and go to their graves that way
and usually transmit it
to the next generation,
their children,
who follow the same course.
Somebody breaks out of that,
answers the call of that inherent.
Whenever any of us come to practice,
we don't know.
It's all intuition.
There's a deep feeling somewhere
deep inside
that there's a way out of
the confusion and craziness
begin to look.
And we discover it.
We wouldn't be sitting here
if we didn't have
complete faith
in the Buddhist ancestors
that are climbing that
triple-tiered falls.
There's no easy matter.
This is not an easy practice.
No question about it.
All of them
that have preceded us,
all of them,
have gone through
the same struggle
that each of us goes through.
Many of them,
much, much worse.
The difficulties in entering
and maintaining the practice
in the 20th century
in America,
it's really no big deal.
It's a little inconvenient.
You've got to rearrange
your schedule.
You hop a plane,
or go to where
a monastery is.
You know where they are.
It's published.
There are maps
and addresses
and everything
is nice and logically arranged.
But these monks
would hear of a master
somewhere
a thousand miles
across the mountains
and off they would go.
And three years,
four years later,
if they weren't eaten
by animals,
wild animals,
or didn't die
of starvation
in the mountains,
they would arrive there.
and the master
wouldn't let them in
and they would persist.
I mean,
you can't stop somebody
that's walked
a thousand miles
across the mountains.
You can't keep them out.
That's practice
during those days.
There weren't a lot
of people doing it,
but the ones that did
was clearly
golden age.
And these two
masters were
how do you
interchange?
Meeting strong
be weak.
Meeting soft
be hard.
Sometimes hard,
sometimes soft.
How do you interchange
freely from one
to the other?
You interchange
by not being fixed.
By not holding on.
That holding on
is the place
that we stick.
We hold on to everything.
We hold on
to all the stuff
before practice
and we hold on
to all the stuff
after practice.
The names of the things
change.
It's still holding on,
which means
it's still based
on the illusion
of a self.
So long as
there's holding on,
there's something
holding on
and that something
is the thing
to let go of.
Let it die
the great death.
Let the dragon
be released.
Let the image
come forth
that's hidden,
suppressed.
San-sheng,
ass,
shue-feng,
the golden fish
that's passed
through the net.
What does it use
for food?
Shan-sheng
is sancho.
Sancho is the
Japanese pronunciation
name.
That's Rinzai's
successor,
his number one
successor.
And shue-feng
is sepo,
successor of toksan,
two very, very
pivotal masters,
strong masters
of Tang dynasty.
Sancho,
you may recall,
was the head monk
of Rinzai's monastery.
Rinzai succeeded
Obaku.
And Rinzai always had
this way of either
punching out
somebody that
asked the question
or shouting
them out.
And it was
standard around
Rinzai's monastery
for monks
meeting each other
in the hall
to shout.
Oh, oh!
And Rinzai would
sit there and say,
which one of them
had it,
which one didn't?
A monk would ask
Rinzai,
what's the truth?
Oh!
Yeah.
What's the Buddha
nature?
Oh!
Yeah.
So, finally,
all his career,
that's what he did.
The shout.
Rinzai's great shout.
And then finally
he got old
and feeble
and was lying
on his deathbed
and Sancho
was standing there
comforting him,
seeing his master off.
And Rinzai,
in a shaky voice,
looks up at Sancho
and says,
please,
don't let my dharma
be extinguished.
And Sancho says,
how can I let
your dharma
be extinguished?
Yeah,
wonderful answer.
How can it be extinguished?
How can you damage it?
How can you do
anything about it?
It reaches everywhere.
Who will do it?
So Sancho says,
how could I?
Rinzai says,
long after I'm gone,
if someone asks you
what Master Rinzai's
teachings are,
how will you answer them?
And Sancho says,
who?
Rinzai looks him
straight in the eye
and says,
to think
my dharma
will be extinguished
in the hands
of this blind ass
and he died.
And of course,
that was his
certification
of having succeeded
in the dharma.
That was the transmission
from Rinzai
to Sancho.
That was his approval
with clarity
of Sancho.
And Sancho after that
traveled from monastery
to monastery
testing his understanding
before he set up
teaching on Sancho Mountain.
and this encounter
with Seppo
was part of that journey.
He visited Kyogen
and all the other
teachers of the time.
Now, Seppo
was the 12th generation
in his lineage.
These were two
separate lineages.
One was the Rinzai lineage,
the other was
from Toksan.
And they were both
from the seventh ancestors.
Eno had two successors.
One started one line,
one started the other.
So they were from
these two separate lines
in different parts
of the country.
And yet,
what was going on
was exactly
the same teaching.
And Seppo,
some of you may recall,
studied with Toksan.
And he and Ganto,
Dorma brothers,
were both students
of Toksan.
And Toksan was
a ferocious master.
He was the one
that would give
30 blows of his stick.
He was just like Rinzai.
Rinzai was the shout
and punch
and Toksan
was with his stick.
30 blows if you
answer affirmatively,
30 blows if you
answer negatively,
30 blows if you
neither affirmatively
or negative,
30 blows if you
don't answer,
30 blows if you
do answer.
There was just
no way out.
So people were
terrified to go
to Toksan with him.
No matter what you
did,
he would start
beating with
a stick on you.
And Ganto,
who was much
younger than Seppo,
realized himself
earlier.
And Seppo,
I guess,
Ganto was
35,
30,
something like that,
and Seppo was
45 or 50,
hadn't realized
himself yet.
And both Ganto
and the old man
were constantly
trying to get
Seppo to
break through.
It's not an easy
practice.
It takes several
years to break
through and clarify
that breakthrough.
It doesn't happen
overnight.
And then it takes
10, 15 years
after that to
perfect it and to
actualize it.
Now, this is not
my saying.
This is standard
understanding in
Zen circles,
how long it takes
to mature
practitioners.
It's not like
any other kind
of training
or education.
Not at all like it.
The whole body
and mind
is involved
in transformation.
It's not a matter
of accumulating
knowledge.
It's not a matter
of assimilating
what somebody else
has assimilated.
That's easy.
It's got to be
new, fresh,
original,
coming from
one's own
original nature.
And so finally
one of the koans
that you may
recall,
Seppo was the
cook and Toksan
was very, very
old at this time.
A lot of his
beating on people
had dissolved
into a real
mellow maturity.
And he came down
carrying his bowls
one day and
Seppo said,
where are you going?
The bell hasn't
rung.
The drum hasn't
sand.
It's not time
for a noonday
meal.
And old Toksan
said, oh,
he turned around
and went back
to his room.
And Genpo
thought he was
hot stuff.
You know,
he beat the old
men in Dharma
combat or something
so he started
bragging.
Ganto,
who heard of
this,
he was the
head monk,
Seppo was
bragging.
Ganto went
to see Seppo
and said,
you know,
what's going on?
Seppo told him
what happened.
Ganto said,
well, you know,
great master
that he is,
he still hasn't
realized the
last word of
Zen.
And the next
thing you know,
everybody around
the monastery
is talking
about the
old man
who hasn't
realized it.
Ganto says
he hasn't
realized the
last word
of Zen.
Later,
Toksan
Sen for
Ganto.
And said,
don't you
approve of
me?
And then
the next
day,
sure enough,
the old
man gets
up to
Yiftesha
and he's
completely
different
than he's
ever been
before.
Brand new.
And when he
finishes his
talk,
Ganto leaps
up clapping
his hands
and says,
wonderful,
wonderful,
at last,
the old
man has
realized the
last word
of Zen.
Now no one
can ever make
light of him.
It was all
for the benefit
of Seppo,
who still
didn't break
through.
Finally,
an absolute
thing,
about ready
to give
up.
So Ganto
said to the
old man,
look,
let me take
Seppo on a
pilgrimage.
Maybe we can
get him to
break through.
So he said,
anything,
go ahead,
take him.
And so they
went on this
pilgrimage,
and during the
pilgrimage,
while they
were one
night resting
somewhere,
dialogue started,
Seppo succeeds
Toksan.
And it's kind
of interesting.
He broke
through under
Ganto.
Ganto wasn't
a teacher yet,
but Ganto
was the one
that helped
him break
through,
his Dharma
brother.
Yet he
succeeded Toksan,
and it turns
out he became
one of the
great masters
at that time,
even more so
than Ganto.
Ganto lost
his head about
five years
later,
an encounter
with this,
and a soldier
chopped his
head off.
Soldiers came
and overran
the monastery,
and all the monks
ran,
and Ganto just
sat there.
Soldier came in
and says,
who are you?
Ganto says,
hola!
And the guy
chopped his
head off.
That was the
end of Ganto.
Seppo,
on the other
hand,
lived in the
mountains,
and kind of
hid out until
things cooled
out,
and then he
came back
again.
So everybody
has their
own style.
I don't think
he enlightened
that soldier,
so it was a
wasted head.
But either
way is okay.
So Seppo,
at this point,
was a very
acknowledged
master.
He was the
origin of
two lineages.
He was
the teacher
of Uman,
also the
teacher of
Hogan.
So there
was two
great lineages
that came
out of
Seppo.
And Sancho
was off
visiting him,
and Sancho
came up
asking this
question,
the golden
fish that's
passed through
the net,
what does
it use
for food?
Well,
of course,
who wants
to know
about such
a question?
Only a
golden fish
that's passed
through a
net.
You don't
ask that
question unless
you think
you've passed
through the
net.
In other
words,
he thinks
he's a
dragon.
Of course,
he succeeded
Rinzai.
So in a
sense,
when he was
coming,
it was like
setting out a
bowl of
glue in a
forest of
thorns to
ask this
question.
Another
master said
as he
approached,
he sees
the hook,
and he
goes right
to it and
starts pulling
on it.
He came
looking for
an encounter.
He wanted
to test
himself,
and he
wanted to
test Seppo.
He wanted
to see what
the rest of
the Dharma
world was
doing.
Very
important
part of
training,
that
testing,
polishing.
clarifying.
That's
the process
that ends
up with
real
dragons.
Snakes
with dragon
heads,
but real
dragons.
So what
kind of
food,
after you've
transformed to
a dragon,
what do
dragons use
for food?
Dharma
food, of
course,
is what
we're talking
about.
What's the
Dharma food
for the
fish,
is one
thing.
In a
sense,
Seshin
is Dharma
food.
It's like
a five
course meal,
appetizer to
dessert.
It all
needs to
really be
chewed and
digested and
assimilated,
little by
little.
It takes
time.
There's no
way to
rush the
process.
We like
to do
everything in
an instant,
but it
takes time.
Residential
training is
like a
ten course
meal,
from appetizer
to dessert.
We have
a choice
on how
we deal
with it.
We can
read the
menu.
It's a
nice menu.
After a
while,
you get
hungry enough,
you get
tired of
reading
menus.
It
doesn't
satisfy
the
appetite.
If there's
indeed an
appetite.
Or,
sometimes you
read the
menu and
you have
the
appetizer,
miss the
meal.
The meal
is every
aspect of
what's going
on orbit.
For what
do dragons
eat?
Free to
birth and
death.
Free to
ride the
clouds and
follow the
wind.
What's the
food for
this kind
of creature?
Xuyang
Feng said,
when you
come out
of the
net,
I'll tell
you.
It was
when you
bleeped
the
falls.
When you
freed
yourself,
I'll tell
you.
Yinshan
Feng said,
teacher of
fifteen hundred
monks and
yet you
don't have
anything to
say?
It's the
best you
can do?
And
Xuyang
Feng said,
I have
many duties
as an
abbot.
I'm very
busy.
No,
this is
kind of
an
interesting
dialogue
that's
going.
Here are
two
equally
matched
adepts.
But how
do you
know that?
And why
did he
say,
when you
come out
of the
net,
then I'll
tell you?
In other
words,
when you're
enlightened,
I'll let
you know.
One
master
said,
Shenfeng
at first
is thirty
steps away
watching you
looking in
yourself and
drawing out
yourself.
And then he
said,
wait until you
come out of
the net
and I'll
tell you.
Then he
compares it to
a national
champion
playing chess,
seeing the
whole thing,
many,
many moves
ahead,
seeing the
whole thing
at once,
not being
just stuck
in that
one place,
360 degree
awareness,
watching you
looking in
yourself and
drawing yourself
out.
The fact is
that there's
no place to
hide.
We constantly
reveal
ourselves in
every action.
We speak of
samadhi.
Samadhi is not
something that
you can hide.
A person who
has experienced
even the
edges of
samadhi,
it shows
immediately.
and it
doesn't just
appear and
vanish,
it shows.
And particularly
when you take
it all into
account,
the whole
24 hours,
and see it
in that
context.
The same
with the
koan.
We reveal
always what
our understanding
is.
You can,
many students
over the years
now,
particularly
lately,
there's a
constant stream
of students
that come
from other
centers.
Some of
them have
actually
completed
their
studies.
Others are
very mature
students.
One koan
is all it
takes to
see exactly,
precisely where
their understanding
is.
Any koan,
doesn't matter
what it is.
The beginning
koan,
middle koan,
end koan,
any one of
them can be
seen in a
hundred different
ways, from
a very, very
gross seeing of
it to a very,
very subtle
interworking
games.
So we
play.
It's kind
of interesting.
A few years
in a row,
we've done
softball games
in the summer
and I videotaped
it.
Sometimes I sit
and look at
that videotape
and you can
see precisely
the way people
practice by how
they play
softball.
Exactly how
they practice,
exactly how
their life
goes,
by how much
goes into
the game,
by how much
they put
themselves out
there,
how much
they're willing
to take a
risk,
how much
they're willing
to damage
themselves.
Fish,
and even
resting,
eating,
service,
study,
asking questions
and making
answers,
how we deal
with pain,
how we deal
with pressure.
You know,
I mean,
I've said it
before and I'll
say it again
a hundred times,
people come to
a monastery
thinking they're
coming to a
sanctuary and I
asked the
Guardian Council
constantly to
make sure people
are clear,
particularly people
that come to
a weekend.
They come here
with some idea
that it's going
to be a place
of bliss and
they find out
they've got to
sit and it's
all hell for
them.
They've been
spending their
lives avoiding
it themselves and
suddenly they have
to confront
themselves.
It's not a
sanctuary, it's a
furnace.
furnace, it's
specifically designed
to be a
furnace, every
aspect of it is
a furnace, every
aspect of practice
is a furnace.
People come
thinking Zazen is
going to be
tranquility.
Zazen is a
gigantic,
monstrous, huge
cosmic enema.
Its function is
to wash away
all traces.
When you come
out of the
net, I'll tell
you, if there
was a speck of
doubt in
Shansheng, he
would immediately
have disintegrated.
He didn't.
Bounced right
back.
One lets go,
the other
holds back.
The other
lets go, the
other holds
back.
It was like a
beautiful dance.
Teacher of
1500 people, yet
you don't even
know a
saying.
My tasks as
abbot are
many.
Beautifully.
Old master
said, when
contending, there's
not enough.
When conceding,
there's always
extra.
Other master
said, the
golden fish that's
passed through the
net, what does it
have for food?
His teacher
said, dry
dung.
Another teacher
said, thanks
for the
offering.
When first
ascending, the
tear of waves,
clouds and
thunder accompany.
Leaping up
magnificently, look
at the great
function.
The great
function is the
truth.
True self.
The reality.
That's the
life of each
one of us.
Buried under
conditioning.
We never get a
chance to really
live out of that
reality.
We tend to
live out of
the conditioning.
We live out of
the program.
With a
burdened tail,
it clearly
crosses the
gate of you,
being transformed
into a dragon.
The beautiful
fish won't
agree to be
sunk in a
pickle jar.
That's kind of
interesting.
I think it was
Rinzai who
said he was
seeing one of
his students
off.
And he said,
in the school
of Rinzai,
there's a red
fin
carp who
wags his
head and
swishes his
tail and
heads south.
In whose
house will
it die
immersed in
a pickle
jar?
That pickle
jar is a
dead fish
whose pickle
jar we
find ourselves
in.
The whole
point of
practice is
to not end
up in a
pickle jar,
but rather
to be a
live dragon
rather than
a dead
fish.
an old
mature man
does not
startle the
crowd.
That's a
well, the
first one,
burnt tail,
he clearly
crosses the
gate of
you.
The beautiful
fish wouldn't
agree to be
stuck in a
pickle jar.
That's speaking
of course
Sancho
praising him.
The next two
lines,
an old
mature man
does not
startle the
crowd,
is a
way of
appreciating,
eulogizing
seppo.
But that
doesn't seem
like much
of a
praise.
An old
mature man
doesn't
startle the
crowd.
But it's
the most
highest
kind of
praise that
can be
heaped on
someone.
He's exactly
like his
old master
Tokusan was.
Remember when
Tokusan came
down and he
said,
oh man,
where are you
going?
The bell
hasn't
rung,
the drum
hasn't
sounded.
And Tokusan
just meekly
turned around
and went
back to
his room
like he
was a
novice.
That was
his absolute
maturity.
The wind
blows from
the east,
leaves gather
in the west.
And so it
is with
seppo.
There's
nothing
startling
about him.
I've got
lots of
work to
do as
the abbot.
And yet,
right through
the heart.
The food
of the
dragon.
Fifteen
courses
laid out.
Next line
says,
someone used
to facing
a great
adversary
has no
fear from
the start.
I mean,
you know,
Tokusan was
probably the
greatest
adversary
anybody
would ever
face.
Seppo
survived
Tokusan.
But me
worry?
There's no
one to think
about Tokusan.
The tougher,
the training
is,
the tougher
the teacher
is,
the more
prepared
for the
world,
for the
practice,
for life.
The more
free
the successor
is.
And it's
the same
all through
nature.
There is
a species
that doesn't
have that
working point.
Floating,
floating,
just as light
as five
ounces.
Massive,
massive,
heavier than
even a
thousand
tons.
Sen
Shang
exalted
fame over
the four
seas.
Who again
was his
peer?
Tremendous
master.
Both of
these were
around the
same age.
Both of
them the
same
lineage,
I mean
the same
generation.
Two
different
lineages.
Seppo
stands alone,
the eight
winds blowing,
do not
move him.
The eight
winds blowing,
the eight
winds of
profit,
decline,
slander,
fame,
praise,
censure,
pain,
pleasure.
One side
or the
other side.
Profit
or decline,
slander or
fame,
praise or
blame,
pain or
pleasure.
Completely
unaffected.
They're like
a breeze
passing by
his ear.
One
master says
you see
his jowls,
the jowls
on his
head from
behind.
That's an
indication of
a very
powerful
person looking
at him
from behind.
His jowls
are so big
you can see
them from
the back
of his
head
hanging
out the
sides.
And about
his standing
alone and the
eight winds
blowing,
do not move
him.
The master
said it's
just as if
it never
happened.
So what's
it all
about?
It's about
that journey
up the
river.
So it
seems.
It seems
to be a
struggle.
It doesn't
need to
be a
struggle.
Life is
only a
struggle
because of
all the
extra.
I mean,
it's not
only that
we're
swimming up
the river
but we're
dragging
along with
us all
this baggage
and spend
a lot
of time
trying to
avoid
engaging.
To engage
your life
is to
engage
your
practice.
That means
to give
yourself up
to it.
To allow
it to
be.
To remove
from it
all the
preconceived
notions
about it.
All the
expectations
about it.
Just allow
it to
be.
It means
to give
up ideas,
positions,
postures.
When we're
finally holding
on to
nothing,
it's
streamlined.
Then the
great way
of the
ancestors
is without
hindrance.
Then the
struggle is
over.
Just like
that fifth
ox-herding
picture.
Doesn't
mean you
need to
go all
the way
to the
end.
Still
halfway
along.
Struggle
is over.
It's like
spring
itself.
There's
nothing
that can
be done
about
spring.
When it
arrives,
it's
truly
here.
Put up
with an
H-year's
life.
Just get
rid of
the extra.
You know
you're
holding on
to something.
There's
even a
speck.
That's all
it means
to begin.
No one
to hold
on.
Nothing
to hold
on to.
Simple
zazen
of
shikantaza.
simple
zazen
of
following
the
breath.
It's
not
complicated.
The
first
step
to
reaching
there
is
samadhi.
You need
to trust
yourself to
let it
happen.
You need
to trust
the process
of
practice.
It
really is
simple.
We make
it complicated.
We make
it complicated
because of
our fears
or anxieties
or greed
or ignorance
all of
which
are based
on
holding on
that
called
Buddhism
itself
that
called
enlightenment
and then
the ten
thousand
things
return
to the
self
where
they've
always
been
right
from
the
beginning.
There's
nothing
to gain
but a
whole
universe.
