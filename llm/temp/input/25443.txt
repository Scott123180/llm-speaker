Master Dogen's 300 Koan Shobo Ginzo
Case 20
Cheng Sha's Stop Illusory Thinking
The main case
Priest Cheng Sha was once asked by the government secretary, Du
When you chop an earthworm into two pieces, both pieces keep moving.
I wonder, in which piece is the Buddha nature?
Cheng Sha said, don't have illusory thoughts.
Du said, how are we to understand that they are both moving?
Cheng Sha said, understand that air and fire are not yet scattered.
Du said nothing.
Cheng Sha called Du, and Du responded, yes.
Cheng Sha said, isn't this your true self?
Du said, apart from my answering, is there another true self?
Cheng Sha said, I can't call you emperor.
Du said, if so, would my not answering also be my true self?
Cheng Sha said, it's not a matter of answering me or not,
but the question to answer or not
has been since the beginningless Kalpa,
the root of birth and death.
And then he recited a verse.
Students of the way don't know the truth.
They only know their past consciousness.
This is the basis of endless birth and death.
They call it the original self.
Commentary
Inconceivably wondrous is the Buddha nature.
Buddha nature, exquisitely all-pervading,
is no Buddha nature.
It has nothing to do with cosmic consciousness
or the divine self.
Both Buddha nature and no Buddha nature
exist in life and in death,
as well as prior to life and death,
and after life and death.
Before there ever was scattering and no scattering,
movement and stillness,
being and non-being,
there has always been Buddha nature
and no Buddha nature.
It is not metaphor, images, or thoughts.
Indeed, it is not like anything.
Don't be deluded.
It is nothing other than what you do
morning and night.
The Capping Verse
Bright day
Blue sky
In a dream
He tries to explain his dream
See
The myriad forms
Arising and vanishing
All abiding
In their own Dharma place
Constantly reveal
The Buddha nature
And this is another one of those koans
of Master Dogen
from his 300 koan collection
that he used
in a very long
fascicle
And since the literature
Abounds in
Various koans
Concerning
Buddha nature
He quotes
Just about all of them
Of course
The koan
Of Joshu
Joshu's Moo
Addresses
Buddha nature
And keep in mind
When Joshu answered
That question
Does a dog
Have Buddha nature
The one that we work with
The first koan
In the Mumongkan
He answered
Moo
Or no
And
But in the
Book of Equanimity
Is the second part
To that koan
Where a monk
Asks
Does a dog
Have Buddha nature
And he said
Yes
And
We've looked
That koans
Where the sixth ancestor
Said
The fifth ancestor
Said to the
Sixth ancestor
That you have
No Buddha nature
Yakujo
Addresses
Buddha nature
Unman
Addresses
Buddha nature
And needless to say
Buddha nature
Is at the
Heart
Of what our practice
Is about
Is about
And what it's about
Is to realize
Our Buddha nature
So that's what
This government
Officer
Was attempting
To do
He was studying
With priest
Chang Shah
And
I've mentioned
Before that
Chang Shah
Was kind of
Poetic
In his way
Of dealing
With the dharma
They're different
In
Unman
And
Joshu
Unman and
Joshu
Had the facility
Of using
Turning words
And directly
Pointing to the truth
Chang Shah
Did it
With
With a poem
So he expressed
It
Poetically
Rather than
With what we call
A turning word
And
He was one of
The great
Masters
Of
The past
And
There are
Many koans
That deal with
Chang Shah's
Teaching
All of them
You'll find
Some kind of
Poetic expression
And
He had
As his
Students
Many
Government
Officials
In this
Case
This was
A government
Secretary
Kind of
Like
Secretary
Of State
Or
Secretary
Of the
Interior
High
Government
Official
And
Probably
That has
A lot
To do
With
The way
The koan
Evolves
And
What
This
Secretary
Wanted
To know
Is
When
You
Chop
An
Earthworm
Into
Two
Pieces
Both
Pieces
Keep
Moving
And
I
Think
Every
Kid
Has
Experienced
This
And
Probably
Wondered
Which
Is
Really
The
Earthworm
This
Fellow
Wanted
To
Know
Which
Piece
Had
The
Buddha
Nature
And
Chang
Sha's
Answer
Was
Simply
Don't
Have
Illusory
Thoughts
Don't
Be
Deluded
Or
Even
I've
Seen
The
Translation
Of
This
Stop
Worrying
About
It
But
He
Persisted
He
Said
How
Are
We
To
Understand
That
They're
Both
Moving
And
Chang
Sha
Said
Understand
That
Air
And
Fire
Are
Not
Yet
Scattered
And
Basically
What
He
Was
Saying
Is
The
Elements
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
Which
Supposedly
Constitute
All
Living
Things
And
The
Way
They
Understood
It
At
That
Time
Is
When
These
Elements
Dispersed
Death
Occurred
So
What
He
Was
He
Was
Saying
Is
That
Air
And
Fire
Not
Yet
Scattered
But
Was
The
Implication
Here
In
That
Statement
And
This
Is
One
Of
The
Points
You
Have
To
Deal
With
In
This
Coen
That
If
It
Did
Scatter
That
There
Would
Be
No
Buddha
Nature
Is
That
What
He
Is
Trying
To
Say
Or
In
Fact
Is
He
Saying
That
The
Reason
They're
Both
Moving
Is
That
The
Elements
Are
Still
Intact
The
Earthworm
Is
Not
Yet
Dead
So
Du
Said
Nothing
And
Then
Chang
Sha
Called
Out
To
Him
Secretary
Du
Du
Responded
Yes
Master
And
Chang
Sha
Said
Isn't
This
Your
True
Self
Isn't
This
Your
True
Nature
And
Then
Du
Went
On
To
Say
Apart
From
My
Answering
Is
There
Another
True
Self
In
Other
Words
Is
There
Another
Part
Of
It
He's
Still
Back
With
The
Earthworm
Which
Side
Has
It
Both
Sides
Have
It
One
Side
Have
It
Neither
Side
Have
It
When
It's
Cut
In
Half
It's
No
Longer
In
Earthworm
So
Chang
Sha
Said
I
Can't
Call
You
Emperor
You
Do
So
That's
What I
Call
You
And
Du
Said
If
So
Would
My
Not
Answering
Also
Be
My
True
Self
He
Said
If
You
Called
Me
Emperor
And
I
Didn't
Answer
Would
That
Not
Answering
Also
Be
My
True
Self
Chang
Shao
Said
It's
Not
A
Matter
Of
Answering
Me
Or
Not
But
The
Question
To
Answer
Or
Not
Has
Since
The
Beginning
With
Kalpa
Been
The
Root
Of
Birth
And
Death
That
Is
To
See
This
Answering
Or
Not
Answering
As
Two
Separate
Things
To
See
Self
And
Other
As
Two
Separate
Things
To
See
Buddha
Nature
Or
Know
Buddha
Nature
As
Two
Separate
Things
Is
The
Root
Of
Birth
Death
Birth
And
Death
Only
Exists
In
Duality
When
There's
A
Self
And
There's
Other
Then
There's
Heaven
And
Hell
And
There's
Birth
And
Death
And
There's
Good
And
Bad
Up
And
Down
Enlightenment
And
Delusion
And
Cheng
Sha
Went
On
To
Say
Students
Of
The
Way
Don't
Know
The
Truth
They
Only
Know
Their
Past
Consciousness
This
Is
The
Basis
Of
Endless
Birth
And
Death
The
Deluded
Call
It
The
Original
Self
What is
The
Past
Consciousness
That
He's
Speaking
Of
The
Commentary
Kind of
Summarizes
The
Whole
Thing
Inconceivably
Wondrous
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
Just
That
Description
Inconceivably
Wondrous
Inconceivable
Unable
To
Be
Conceived
Of
There's
No
Way
To
Conjure
A
Thought
To
Conceive
Of
Buddha
Nature
Whatever
You
Think
It
Is
It's
Not
Exquisitely
All
Pervading
Is
No
Buddha
Nature
Buddha
Nature
And
No
Buddha
Nature
Are
Mutually
Arising
Codependent
And
Not
Separate
From
Each
Other
It
It
Has
Nothing
To
Do
With
Cosmic
Consciousness
Or
The
Divine
Self
Many
People
Interpret
Buddha
Nature
Because
Of
Our
Judeo
Christian
Background
We
Somehow
See
What's
Called
Buddha
Nature
In
Terms
Of
A
Soul
Or
Something
That
Survives
Death
Well
The
Fact
Is
In
Life
There's
Buddha
Nature
In
Death
There's
Buddha
Nature
Before
Life
And
Death
There's
Buddha
Nature
After
Life
And
Death
There's
Buddha
Nature
So
Is
Buddha
Nature
A
Soul
No
Both
Buddha
Nature
And
No
Buddha
Nature
Exist
In
Life
And
In
Death
As
Well
As
Prior
To
Life
And
Death
And
After
Life
And
Death
Before
There
Ever
Was
Scattering
Of
The
Elements
Movement
And
Stillness
Being
And
Non-Being
There
Has
Always
Been
Buddha
Nature
And
No
Buddha
Nature
It's
Not
A
Metaphor
It's
Not
An
Image
It's
Not
A
Thought
Indeed
Buddha
Nature
Is
Not
Like
Anything
There's
Nothing
To
Compare
It
With
But
Don't
Be
Deluded
It
Is
Nothing
Other
Than
What
You
Do
Morning
And
Night
I've
Added
Footnotes
Priest
Chang
Shah
Was
Once
Asked
By
The
Government
Secretary
Do
When
You
Chop
An
Earthworm
Into
Two
Pieces
Both
Pieces
Keep
Moving
I
Wonder
In
Which
Piece
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
And
The
Footnote
Says
The
Buddha
Nature
Is
Chopped
Into
Which
Piece
Has
The
Worm
That's
What
Dogen
Suggests
Is
A
Much
More
Appropriate
Way
Of
Expressing
The
Question
You
Chop
The
Worm
In
Half
You
Chop
The
Buddha
Nature
In
Half
Which
Half
Has
The
Worm
You
May
Ask
How
Can
You
Chop
Buddha
Nature
In
Half
So
I
Ask
How
Do
You
Chop
A
Worm
In
Half
Chop
Chopping
The
Worm
In
Half
Implies
That
Once
There
Was
One
Worm
And
Now
There
Are
Two
Pieces
To
It
Yeah
Dogen
Says
It
Was
Never
One
Nor
Is
It
Two
If
You
Try
To
Understand
This
Language
From
Our
Dualistic
Reference
System
The
Whole
Thing
Doesn't
Make
Sense
At
All
That's
One
Of
The
Virtues
Of
Koans
They
Force
Us
To
Abandon
That
Referential
Way
Of
Understanding
Things
And
To
See
Directly
Into
The
Truth
How
Do
You
See
Directly
Into
The
Truth
You
Have
To
Abandon
The
Notion
Of
A
Self
That's
Where
Dogen's
Coming
From
When
He
Speaks
Of
This
That's
Where
Chang
Sha
Is
Coming
From
That's
Not
Where
The
Secretary
Do
Is
Coming
From
So
He
Says
When
You
Chop
An
Earthworm
Into
Two
Pieces
Both
Pieces
Keep
Moving
I
Wonder
In
Which
Piece
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
Chang
Sha
Said
Don't
Have
Illusory
Thoughts
Footnotes
To
That
Says
How
Nice
But
Will
It
Awaken
Someone
That
Is
Fast
Asleep
I
Mean
It
Doesn't
Seem
Like
Much
Of
A
Teaching
Don't
Have
Illusory
Thoughts
It's
Nice
It's
True
But
Does
It
Impart
Any
Strength
Does
It
Do
Anything
And
I
Can
Just
Imagine
Master
Rinzai
And
This
Secretary
Which
Piece
Says
The
Buddha
Nature
Rinzai
Would
Probably
Have
Driven
Him
Out
With
His
Stick
And
Probably
The
Secretary
Would
Have
Had
Rinzai's
Head
For
It
That's
Why
He
Wasn't
A
National
Teacher
Next
Line
Do
Said
How
Are
We
To
Understand
That
They're
Both
Moving
He
Persists
Somehow
He's
Associated
Movement
Now
With
Buddha
Nature
Footnote
To
That
Says
See
Where
Is
This
All
Leading
To
He's
Still
In
The
Same
Rut
Chang
Sha's
Don't
Have
Illusory
Thoughts
Has
Had
Absolutely
No
Effect
On
Him
He
Just
Goes
On
In
The
Same
Rut
Chang
Sha
Then
Said
Understand
That
Air
And
Fire
Are
Not
Yet
Scattered
Footnote
To
That
Said
When
It
Does
Scatter
Where
Will
The
Buddha
Nature
Be
Let's
Assume
That
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
All
Separate
Where
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
The
Great
Culpa
Fire
At
The
End
Of
The
Universe
Completely
Consumes
Everything
Where
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
Master
Totsetsu
Said
You
Monks
The
Whole
Point
Of
Your
Training
Was
To
Understand
Your
True
True
Nature
Buddha
Nature
Right
Here
Now
Where
Is
Your
Buddha
Nature
Show
Me
And
Then the
Second
Of his
Three
Barriers
He
Says
If
If
If you
Understand
Your
True
Nature
And
Then
You
Will
Surely
Understand
When you're
About to
Die
Where it
Will be
At the
Moment of
Your death
Of your
Last breath
Where is
Where is
The
Buddha
Nature
And then
His third
Barrier
He said
After you
Die and the
Four elements
Are scattered
To the
Winds
There's
Nothing
Left
But dust
Where will
The
True
Nature
Be
Where will
Your
True
Self
Be
Where will
Your
Original
Self
Be
It's the
Realization
Of that
Buddha
Nature
The
Original
Self
That
Finally
He settles
The question
Of life
And death
And a lot
Of other
Questions
Settles
The questions
Of the
Dualities
All of
Them
So
After he
Said
Understand
That air
And fire
Not yet
Scattered
Do said
Nothing
The footnote
Says
Did he get
It
Or is
He just
Thinking
About
It
The silence
Could mean
Many
Things
I think
It's
Pretty
Clear
That when
Chang
Sha said
Understand
That air
And fire
Are not
Yet scattered
That what
He was
Addressing
Is the
Fact that
How are
To we
To understand
That they
Are both
Moving
Both of
These sides
Are moving
Essentially
What he's
Saying
In plain
English
Is
They're
Not dead
Yet
So
After
Do said
Nothing
Chang
Sha
Called
Out
Secretary
Do
Footnote
Says
Hey
Wake
Up
Come
Out
Of
Your
Hole
And
Do
Responded
Yes
Footnote
To that
Says
Water
In
The
Bucket
Rice
In
The
Bowl
Oh
And
He
Called
Do
Footnote
Says
Wake
Up
Come
Out
Of
Your
Hole
That
Hole
Is
A
Kind
Of
Restricted
Vision
Restricted
Understanding
That
Do
Has
We
Refer
To
It
In
Many
Ways
In
The
Zen
Literature
We
Call
Blinders
Take
Off
The
Blinders
Set
Down
The
Pack
The
Blinders
Are
What
Restricts
Our
Vision
There's
No
Peripheral
Vision
It's
Just
The
Road
Straight
Ahead
They
Used
To
Do
That
For
The
Horses
When
I
Was
A
Kid
All
Of
The
Commercial
Horses
The
Garbage
Man
And
The
Milk
Man
And
The
Iceman
And
The
Police
Van
The
Even
UPS
Used to
Come
With
Horses
And
Wagons
That's
How
Old
I
Am
And
All
Those
Horses
Had
These
Blinders
On
So
They
Weren't
Distracted
By
Traffic
And
Other
Horses
And
Things
That
Were
Going
On
They
Could
Only
See
The
Road
Ahead
Of
Them
Take
Off
The
Blinders
Open
Up
Your
Vision
So
You
See
The
Whole
Thing
Set
Down
The
Pack
The
Pack
Is
The
Baggage
The
Baggage
That
We
Carry
Around
With
Us
All
Of
Our
Lives
We
We
All
Do
It
We
Start
Off
As
Infants
With
Little
Tiny
Knapsacks
And
As
We
Grow
Up
We
Fill
It
And
As
We
Get
Older
We
Need
Bigger
And
Bigger
Ones
And
By
The
Time
We're
Adults
We've
Got
These
Huge
Packs
That
We
Carry
Around
All
The
Stuff
That
We
Hold
On
To
And
Then
We
Figure
There's
Hope
We
Find
A
Zen
Practice
Center
And
Set
Down
The
Knapsack
And
We
Put
Another
Pack
On
Our
Back
Dharma
Pack
We
Fill
That
With
Buddhist
Stuff
That
We
Carry
Around
It
Seems
That
We've
Got
This
Absolute
Need
To
Go
Through
Life
With
A
Pack
On
Our
Back
We
Create
A
New
Set
Of
Blinders
They
Become
Dharma
Blinders
The
Only
True
Way
Is
The
Buddha
Way
Everything
Else
Sucks
Well
One
Is
Just
As
Deluded
As
Another
Doesn't
Matter
Whether
You've
Got
A
Mercedes
In
Your
Backpack
Or
A
Buddha
Image
The
Very
Fact
That
You're
Carrying
It
Around
On
Your
Back
Means
You're
Separated
From
It
And
That
Separation
Is
Exactly
What
He's
Talking
About
As
Being
The
Basis
Of
Endless
Birth
And
Death
It's
Not
The
Original
Self
So
Chang
Sha
Called
Out
And
Do
Responded
And
Then
Chang
Sha
Said
Isn't
This
Your
True
Self
Isn't
What
Your
True
Self
What's
He
Talking
About
Footnote
Says
What's
He
Doing
He's
Trying
To

The

Now
I
Find
It's
You

Again
The
Calling
And
Answering
So what
Is
This
Calling
And
Answering
And
What
Is
It
That
Chang

Meant
When
He
Said
Isn't
This

True

Said
Apart

He's
Looking

Two

There
No

The
Case

An
Expression
Of
My
True
Self
Footnote
Says
Too
Much
Courtesy
Impairs
One's
Virtue
I
Don't
Know
If
It's
Just
Chang
Sha
Style
Or
The
Fact
That
He's
Dealing
With
The
Secretary
Of
State
That
He's
Really
Gotten
Caught
Up
In
This
Endless
Dialogue
I
Understand
How
It
Happens
Because
Every
Once
In
A
While
I
Get
Sucked
In
By
Students
With
Lots
Of
Questions
And
Somehow
There's
The
Hope
That
Through
The
Questions
And
Answers
That
You
Finally
Lead
Them
Out
Of
The
Forest
Of
Brambles
Into
The
Bright
Light
Of
Day
But
All
That
Happens
Is
That
It
Gets
More
And
More
Complicated
So
That
After
A
Few
Minutes
Of
Dialogue
The
Both
Of
Us
Up
To
Our
Nostrils
In
Brambles
Trying
To
Get
Out
Of
It
And
I
Think
That's
What's
Happening
Here
Because
He's
Dealing
With
The
Secretary
Of
State
Trying
To
Be
Very
Courteous
To
Him
Because
Of
His
Office
So
Chang
Sha's
Answer
To
Would
My
Not
Answering
Also
Be
My
True
Self
Was
It's
Not
A
Matter
Of
My
Answering
Or
Not
But
The
Question
To
Answer
Or
Not
To
Even
Bring
Up
That
Question
Answering
Or
Not
Answering
Which
Side
Has
The
Buddha
Nature
Is
In
It
In
It
Self
The
Source
The
Root
Of
Birth
And
Death
And
Then
His
Commentary
Students
Of
The
Way
Don't
Know
The
Truth
They
Only
Know
Their
Past
Consciousness
This
Is
The
Basis
Of
Endless
Birth
And
Death
And
The
Deluded
Call
It
The
Original
Self
The
Footnotes
Is
True
Enough
But
Did
He
Get
It
Pretty
Clearly
He
Didn't
Get
It
Somehow
The
Eloquence
Of
Chang
Sha
And
The
Beauty
Of
His
Poetry
Failed
To
Reach
The
Truth
Of
What
This
Koan
Is
About
So
How
Do
You
Answer
When
You
Chop
An
Earthworm
Into
Two
Pieces
Both
Pieces
Keep
Moving
In
Which
Piece
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
If
You
Say
The
Short
Piece
It
Misses
It
You
Say
The
Long
Piece
It
Misses
It
You
Say
Both
Of
Them
It
Misses
It
If
You
Say
Neither
Of
Them
It
Misses
It
So
Save
Yourself
To
Trouble
Of
Coming
Into
The
Doksan
Room
With
Any
Of
Those
How
Do
You
Start
Jumping
Around
And
Wiggling
Around
Like
An
Earthworm
Wrong
Save
Yourself
To
Trouble
If
You
Going
To
Come
In
And
Shout
Wrong
Save
Yourself
To
Trouble
If
You
Going
To
Point
To
This
And
That
And
Here
And
There
Wrong
Save
Yourself
To
Trouble
So
What's
The
Truth
Of
This
Just
Don't
Have
Illusory
Thoughts
Are
There
Thoughts
That
Are
Not
Illusory
If
You
Say
Yes
You
Miss
It
If
You
Say
No
You
Miss
It
That
You
Leap
Clear
Of
That
One
Seems
Like
A
Simple
Enough
Question
Why
Didn't
Shang
Sha
Just
Simply
Answer
The
Man
How
Did
It
Evolve
Into
This
Long
Convoluted
Dialogue
Dogen
Dogen
Dogen says
Really
Look closely
And
Understand
That air
And fire
Are not
Yet
Scattered
The elements
Have not
Yet
Scattered
Dogen
Dogen
Says
That
Is
Buddha
Nature
Has
Emerged
Do
We
Take
Movement
To
Mean
Buddha
Nature
Or
To
Mean
Wind
And
Fire
Realize
That
Buddha
Nature
And
Wind
And
Fire
Can
Neither
Emerge
Together
Nor
Independently
Nor
Is
Wind
And
Fire
Within
Itself
Buddha
Nature
Therefore
Chang
Sha
Neither
Said
The
Worm
Had
Or
Did
Not
Have
Buddha
Nature
He
Only
Said
Do
Not
Be
Deluded
Do
Not
Be
Deluded
And
The
Elements
Have
Not
Yet
Scattered
Chang
Sha's
Words
Elucidate
The
Function
Of
Buddha
Nature
The
Words
The
Elements
Have
Not
Yet
Scattered
Deserve
Special
Consideration
Clarify
Them
In
Silence
In
The
Capping
Verse
Bright
Day
Blue
Blue
Sky
In a
Dream
He
Tries
To
Explain
His
Dream
See
The
Myriad
Forms
Arising
And
Vanishing
All
Abiding
In
Their
Own
Dharma
Place
Constantly
Revealed
Buddha
Buddha
Nature
Bright
Day
Blue
Sky
Means
Nothing
Is
Hidden
Nothing
Is
Obscured
Everything
Is
Right
Out
There
The
Truth
Of
The
Buddha
Dharma
Is
Right
Out
There
Under
The
Clear
Bright
Sun
And
Although
That
Exists
We
Go
Through
Life
As
If
In
A
Dream
And
In
A
Dream
He
Tries
To
Explain
His
Dream
He
Tries
To
Understand
His
Dream
While
Still
Dreaming
Pretty
Hopeless
Task
Within
Delusion
We
Try
To
Figure
Out
The
Buddha
Dharma
With
The
Deluded
Mind
Can't
Be
Done
That's
Why
In
Zen
Our
Approach
Is
Very
Direct
Cut
Off
All
Illusory
Thoughts
And
Go
Directly
To
The
Ground
Of
Being
Other
Traditions
Use
Other
Upaya
The
Sutras
Chanting
The
Name
Of
The
Buddha
The
Precepts
And
On
And
On
And
Zen
Cut
Off
All
Delusory
Thoughts
How
Do
You
Cut
Off
All
Delusory
Thoughts
Forget
The
Self
Forget
The
Self
And
Be
The
Corn
Forget
The
Self
And
Be
The
Breath
Forget
The
Self
And
Be
The
Moment
And
How
Do
You
Forget
The
Self
Zazen
There's
No
Other
Way
Zazen
Is
The
Falling
Away
Of
Body
And
Mind
So
Bright
Day
Blue
Sky
In
A
Dream
He
Tries
To
Explain
His
Dream
See
The
Myriad
Forms
Arising
And
Vanishing
Coming
And
Going
All
Abiding
In
Their
Own
Dharma
Place
Each
Thing
Complete
Just
As
It
Is
No
Thing
No
Creature
Ever
Fails
Fall
Short
Of
Its
Own
Completeness
Never
Fails
To
Cover
The
Ground
Upon
Which
It
Stands
That's
What
It
Means
To
Abide
In
Their
Own
Dharma
Place
Each
Thing
Is
Complete
In
And
Of
It
So
Each
Moment
Is
Complete
In
And
Of
It
So
And
It's
In
This
Completeness
That
There
Is
Constantly
Being
Revealed
The
Buddha
Nature
The
Buddha
Nature
The
Nature
Of
All
Sentient
Beings
Your
Nature
So
Why
Is
It
So
Complicated
If
It's
All
Pervading
Reaching
Everywhere
Why
Is
It
That
It
Can't
Be
Understood
Through
Metaphor
Thought
Image
It's
Precisely
Because
It
Reaches
Everywhere
That
It's
Not
Like
Anything
That
Is
There's
Nothing
That
It
Can
Be
Compared
To
There's
Nothing
That's
Outside
It
To
Compare
It
To
And
That's
Why
It's
Difficult
To
Realize
Because
The
Way
We
Go
At
It
Is
From
The
Point
Of
View
Of
Separation
Even
In
That
Separation
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
Even
In
Our
Most
Deluded
Thoughts
Is
The
Buddha
Nature
And
Why
Can't
We
Realize
It
Buddha
Nature
Is
Not
Enlightenment
It's
Not
Something
That
Happens
That
You
Get
The
Buddha
Nature
When
You
Become
Enlightened
And
It's
Just
As
Present
In
Delusion
So
What
Is
It
Where
Is
It
Right
Now
Where
Is
Your
Buddha
Nature
These
Are
Important
Questions
Questions
Not
Just
Because
Of
Their
Theoretical
Value
Or
Because
It's
Good
To
Know
About
Buddhism
Because
The
Answers
To
Those
Questions
Are
Transformative
They're
They're
They're
They're
They're
Not
About
Gaining
More
Information
They're
Not
About
A
New
Belief
System
They're
Not
About
Understanding
They're
Transformative
They
Change
Your
Way
Of
Perceiving
Yourself
And
The
Universe
And
Once
That
Different
Way
Of
Perceiving
The
Universe
And
Yourself
Takes
Place
Then
Every
Action
Is
A
Manifestation
Of
The
Wisdom
And
Compassion
Of
The
Buddha
That's
The
Route
That's
The
Route
That's
Been
Taken
By
Tens
Of
Thousands
Of
Buddhist
Men
And
Women
Throughout
History
2500
Years
It's
Been
Going
On
And
That's
The
Route
For
Each
One
Of
Us
It
Can't
Be
Attained
It
Can't
Be
Given
It
Can't
Be
Received
It
Can
Only
Be
Realized
