The Gateless Gate
Oreo's Three Barriers
Part Two
The Three Barriers is a con
that Master Oreo always used
in questioning his disciples.
Master Soju made a poem
on each of Oreo's Three Barriers
and added one of his own at the end,
offering these poems
as a way of thanking Master Mumman,
who had been kind enough
to come give tesho on the 48 koans.
Why is my hand like the Buddha's hand?
I could feel the pillow at my back
and involuntarily I gave a great laugh.
In truth, the whole body is the hand.
Why is my leg like a donkey's leg?
Even before taking a step,
I have already arrived.
Freely I pass over the four seas
just as I wish.
I ride backward on Yogi's
three-legged donkey.
Everyone has his own cause of birth.
Each has realized
his antecedent determinant.
Nata broke his bones
and returned them to his father.
Did the fifth ancestor
ever rely on any paternal relation?
Buddha's hand,
donkey's leg,
and the cause of birth.
They are neither Buddha,
nor Tao,
nor Zen.
Do not wonder
why gateless barriers
are so difficult.
They have aroused
the monk's intense animosity.
Master Mumman was lately
at Zvigan.
Settling down in the Zen seat,
he criticized Korn,
old and new.
He cut off the ways
for both the wise
and the ordinary.
A number of dragons in hiding
may stir up
a peal of thunder.
Master Mumman
has been invited
as the leading monk.
I thank him
with this humble poem.
Written in the late spring
of the third year of Jyotai,
1230,
by Murillo Soju.
First, I think I should explain
that normally we sit
two periods
and then have the Dharma talk.
Today we shorten it
to one period
so that we're going
to have an early lunch,
a barbecue,
out here
and then prepare
for a wedding
that's going to be
taking place
at two o'clock
so that's why
everything is kind of
moved up.
This weekend
has been a
weekend
Zen training intensive,
kind of like a session.
and during the Dharma talk
yesterday
I presented
the first two parts
of this koan
and today I'm going
to complete it.
Each section
in itself
is a koan.
This koan
comes from
Master Uryu
who lived
who lived
in the Song
dynasty
and he used
these three
barriers
to test
his monks.
He would
sit with a student
and he'd hold
out his hand
and he'd say
why is my hand
like the Buddha's
hand
or he
again he would
show his leg
and he would ask
why is my leg
like a donkey's
leg.
and
or he would say
we all
everyone
has his own
cause of birth
what is the cause
of your birth?
And of course
he's not looking
for explanations
he's looking
for the truth
to be revealed.
And all through
his teaching years
over 30 years
none of the monks
could ever satisfy him.
Many of them
came forward
tried to answer
and
the master
never
said that the answer
was right or wrong
and the monks
began to call them
Uryu's three barriers.
And here
in this koan
Soju
Master Soju
took up
those three barriers
and added
a poem
to each of them
as a way
of kind of
revealing the Dharma
the truth
of them.
And then
he kind of
drew it all together
in a fourth
poem
and then
finally
used the whole
thing as a way
of thanking
Master Mumman.
Master Mumman
and Master Soju
were
lived at the same time
and they were
both equally
attained masters
and Soju
was the head
of a monastery
called
Zui Gan
Zui Ganji
and he invited
Master Mumman
to come
and be the teacher
for the monks.
In those days
the abbot
was kind of
an administrator
and
what we call
the Goto
was the teacher.
And so
Mumman
came
to be Goto
at Zui Ganji
and it's
during that time
giving these
48 talks
that the
48 koans
that are called
the Mumman
Khan
were
first created
as
a collection.
Mumman
Khan
as I explained
yesterday
is partly
Mumman's
name
it's kind of
a play on
his name
Mumman
Mu means
no
Mon
means gate
and
Khan
means
barrier
so
it's
Mumman's
barrier
a collection
of 48 koans
or you could
say it's the
no gate
barrier
that is
the
gateless
barrier
and the
implication
is that
there's no way
to enter
it's a
barrier
that provides
no entrance
and the
reason it
has no
entrance
and the
reason
there's no
way to
enter
is because
what they're
talking about
is already
the life
of each
one of us
Buddha
I mentioned
I mentioned
yesterday
the example
of a fish
sitting in the
middle of the
Atlantic Ocean
asking
another fish
how do you
enter the
ocean
it's already
the life
of each
one of us
and that's
what's to be
realized
it's based on
Shakyamuni Buddha's
own statement
upon his own
realization
when he
said all
sentient beings
have the
Buddha
nature
that being
the case
then why
do we
practice
what Shakyamuni
was saying
is that each
one of us
is perfect
and complete
lacking
nothing
and for
2,500
years
practitioners
and monks
have been
aware
of that
fact
yet being
aware
of that
fact
doesn't
impart
any
strength
because
what the
truth is
has nothing
to do
with
understanding
or believing
it has
to do
with
realizing
and to
realize
that
truth
the
barrier
is
entered
when the
barrier
is entered
is even
extra
it implies
coming from
the outside
there is
no outside
there's no
place to
stand
yesterday
I dealt
with
the first
line
why is my
hand like
the Buddha's
hand
and the
second
line
why is my
leg
like a
donkey's
leg
and again
and again
what it
points to
is the
same thing
we say
over and
over and
over again
but few
realize what
it really
means
that is to
study the
way
to study
zen
is to
study the
self
and to
study the
self
is to
forget the
self
and to
forget the
self
is to
be
enlightened
by the
ten thousand
things
that's what
they're talking
about
to forget
the self
to forget the
self is what
the whole
process is
basically about
because it's
the illusion
of a self
that separates
us from
the ten thousand
things
and as I
mentioned
yesterday
you don't
need to
know anything
about Buddhist
philosophy
theology
psychology
history
to forget
the self
all you need
to do is
to shut up
and sit
when I say
shut up
I mean not
just verbally
but mentally
as well
the most
important part
of shutting
up
is to
stop
talking
to
ourselves
it's that
talking to
ourselves
that
preoccupies
us
that takes
us away
from the
moment
that takes
us away
from the
place
that our
life is
happening
and so
the internal
dialogue
goes on
incessantly
preoccupation
with the
past
which has
already
happened
preoccupation
with the
future
hasn't
happened
yet
and while
we consume
our energy
in past
and future
we miss
our life
as it's
happening
and all
these old
masters are
talking about
is bringing
it home
to this
very
moment
so
because
all of
us
are perfect
and complete
lacking
nothing
because
all of
us
are
enlightened
as is
the
Buddha
all
kinds
of
devices
are
employed
in order
to get
us to
realize
that
not
understand
it
it's
easy
to get
someone
to
understand
it
not
believe
it
it's
easy
to
get
people
to
believe
what
we're
talking
about
goes
beyond
understanding
and
belief
it's
the
heart
of the
matter
itself
it's
the
direct
and
very
very
personal
experience
of that
reality
and
it's
that
experience
that's
transformative
it's
that
experience
that
imparts
strength
to our
life
the
third
poem
is
everyone
has
his
own
course
of
birth
each
has
realized
his
antecedent
determinant
natta
broke
his
bones
and
returned
them
to
his
father
did
the
fifth
patriarch
ever
rely
on
any
paternal
relation
this
was
his
first
barrier
that
he
tested
his
monks
with
he
would
say
everyone
has
his
own
cause
of
birth
what's
the
cause
of
your
birth
these
are
these
are
this
particular
one
is a
nanto
barrier
nanto
koan
difficult
to pass
through
it's
one of
the
five
groups
of
koans
now
it's
an
indisputable
fact
that
every
sentient
being
has
its
own
cause
and
we
realize
it's
a
basic
teaching
of
buddhism
every
effect
there's
a
cause
and
then
that
effect
becomes
the
cause
of
the
next
effect
and
the
one
characteristic
of
cause
and
effect
is
the
force
to
propagate
itself
to
continue
what we
call
karma
so
each
one
of
us
has
a
direct
determinant
definite
circumstances
are
responsible
for
our
being
born
in
this
world
in
India
it's
been
traditionally
believed
that
a
life
in
this
present
world
is
the
effect
of
a
karmic
causation
for
one's
past
life
and
that
one's
parents
serve
only
as
a
subsidiary
condition
to help
it
that
we
actually
select
our
parent
in this
coin
we're
talking
about
something
else
we're
talking
about
the
true
cause
of
birth
that
exists
even
prior
to
the
past
karmic
cause
that
is
before
our
parents
were
born
that's
what
the
sixth
patriarch
asked
of
Monk
Mio
think
neither
good
nor
evil
he
said
at
that
very
moment
what
is
your
original
face
the
face
you
had
before
your
parents
were
born
and
there's
all
kinds
of
karma
there's
the
karma
of us
as an
individual
there's
the
karma
of
a
group
there's
the
karma
of
a
couple
there's
a
teacher
student
karma
there's
the
karma
of
the
group
that's
just
here
today
at
this
moment
together
there's
a
cause
that
brings
us
together
and
together
we
create
an
effect
it's
kind
of
interesting
when
this
September
1st
is the
anniversary
of
nine
years
of
coming
to
this
mountain
of
starting
a
residential
program
here
in
1980
and
the
karma
of
that
goes
all
the
way
back
it's
kind
of
interesting
when you
look
at
it
we
go
back
to
the
people
before
us
the
Lutherans
that
owned
this
and
then
prior
to
that
the
Catholics
and
Father
Scully
that
built
this
monastery
dragging
rocks
down
the
side
of
this
mountain
almost
a hundred
years
ago
cutting
the
logs
from
the
mountain
building
the
structure
but
prior to
that
the
Sopas
Indians
that
lived
on
this
mountain
the
countless
wildlife
that
have
come
and
gone
the
mountain
itself
millions
upon
millions
of years
old
and
all
of it
is
part
of
our
own
karma
and
not
only
karma
it's
part
of
our
own
physical
reality
I've
mentioned
before
those
of us
that
live
here
eat
the
food
from
the
garden
breathe
the
air
it's
all
the
creation
of
this
mountain
and
its
karma
we
absorb
it
into
our
system
in
a
sense
we
absorb
the
mountain
we
drink
its
water
breathe
its
air
eat
its
food
return
its
waste
back
to
the
mountain
it
creates
a real
sense
of
intimacy
but
what
this
old
master
is
talking
about
is
the
true
cause
of
birth
that
needs
to be
grasped
in the
sphere
even
prior
to
past
karmic
cause
in other
words
the
absolute
basis
of
reality
is
what
he's
talking
about
what
is
the
true
self
prior
to
all
of
this
what
is
it
that's
beyond
time
and
space
beyond
form
and
emptiness
the
Buddha
said
if
you
want
to
know
the
past
look
at
the
present
if
you
want
to
know
the
future
look
at
the
present
this
present
moment
contains
both
this
present
moment
contains
10,000
kalpas
10,000
eons
in fact
this
present
moment
is
beyond
all
of
the
definitions
of
time
and
space
so
what
is
it
what
is
that
true
self
that he's
asking
us
to
realize
each
one
of
these
donkey's
leg
Buddha's
hand
cause
of
birth
one's
own
birth
all
come
back
to
the
same
place
the
nature
of
the
self
the
true
self
not
the
skin
bag
not
all
the
ideas
and
concepts
that we
use to
define
ourselves
as
the
things we
identify
with
or hold
on to
but
the
true
self
it's
kind of
interesting
we
grasp
at
things
so
quickly
so
easily
and yet
when you
look at
the
self
you
realize
that it's
in a
constant
state
of
change
it's
not
fixed
who you
are now
is not
who you
were
when you
were
three
months
old
nothing's
the
same
about
it
you
don't
look
the
same
act
the
same
think
the
same
feel
the
same
nothing's
the
same
nothing's
the
same
will
be
when
you're
80
years
old
20
years
from
now
it's
not
only
that
big
leap
in
time
but
five
years
ago
chemically
and
physically
molecule
by
molecule
atom
by
atom
you're
not
the
same
not
one
atom
in
your
body
right
now
was
there
five
years
ago
not
one
molecule
we're
in a
constant
state
of
change
in a
constant
state
of
becoming
and
the
minute
we
try
to
take
hold
of
it
and
fix
it
it
changes
it's
gone
the
minute
you
grab
it
and
say
I've
got
it
it's
changed
it's
no
longer
what
you
grabbed
at
you've
changed
and
it's
changed
so
what's
the
truth
that
penetrates
through
all
of
that
what's
the
absolute
basis
of
all
of
that
is
what
he's
asking
what's
the
true
self
when
the
universe
collapses
it
is
not
destroyed
what
is
that
it
that's
not
destroyed
when
the
universe
collapses
to
really
understand
that
cause
of
birth
is
to
really
understand
life
as
the
unborn
and
death
as
the
unextinguished
that's
not
just
a
play
on
words
that's
the
truth
that
is
to
be
realized
by
each
one
of
us
in
birth
not
a
single
molecule
is
added
in
death
not
a
single
particle
is
lost
he
tries
to
clarify
this
by
talking
about
nanta
nanta
broke
his
bones
and
returned
them
to
his
father
it
refers
to
a
story
in
a
work
called
the
goto
igen
prince
nanta
tore
off
his
flesh
and
returned
it
to
his
mother
he
broke
his
bones
and
returned
them
to
his
father
having
done
so
he
revealed
his
true
body
and
making
use
of
his
supernatural
power
he
taught
the
dharma
for
the
sake
of
his
parents
and
his
physical
body
given
by
our
parents
is
but
a
temporary
form
it's
subject
to
coming
and
going
only
when
we've
transcended
the
temporal
physical
body
can
we
realize
the
true
body
that
is
once
we've
gone
beyond
the
illusion
of
the
bag
of
skin
we
begin
to
realize
what
he
calls
your
antecedent
determinant
and
then
in
the
last
line
he
said
did
the
fifth
patriarch
ever
rely
on
any
paternal
relationship
and
what
that's
about
some
of
you
may
recall
the
story
of
the
transmission
of
the
dharma
from
the
fifth
patriarch
to
the
sixth
patriarch
I
mean
from
the
fourth
patriarch
to
the
fifth
patriarch
and
it
said
in
the
story
that
in
his
previous
life
master
gyunin
who
was
the
fifth
patriarch
had
been
a
hermit
called
saisho
who
lived
on
Mount
hato
and
one
day
in
that
former
life
he
happened
to
meet
doshin
the
fourth
patriarch
on
a
mountain
and
asked
if
he
could
study
zen
under
him
and
the
fourth
patriarch
told
saisho
that
he
was
too
old
to
start
his
study
man
was
in
his
late
nineties
but
he
was
too
old
by
time
he
finished
his
study
he
would
end
up
not
able
to
be
around
long
enough
to
train
his
successors
to
know
to
know
to
know
about
the
lineage
with
Kori
Roshi
Kori
Roshi
is
a
lay
Roshi
that
transmitted
one
of
those
lineages
I
was
talking
about
yesterday
the
Takuji
lineage
and
he
was
about
85
years
old
and
all
of
his
successors
were
in
their
80s
and
he
was
getting
very
old
and
in
fact
he
was
dying
we
expected
any
day
we
were
going
to
hear
that
you
know
Kori
Roshi
finally
died
he
had
gotten
very
thin
and
very
emaciated
looking
and
you
have
to
understand
that
this
man
was
a
survivor
of
Hiroshima
when
the
bomb
fell
on
Hiroshima
he
was
there
in
the
city
he
was
part
of
the
Japanese
National
Guard
and
he
had
a
feeling
before
the
bomb
fell
that
something
awful
was
going
to
happen
and
he
took
his
hundred
men
and
they
went
underground
and
sure
enough
within
10-15
minutes
the
bomb
fell
the
city
was
annihilated
and
of course
all of
these
people
came
up
to
run
around
helping
putting
out
fires
and
helping
people
and
of course
they
were
walking
right
who
knew
about
radiation
exposure
at
that
time
so
they
all
had
very
excessive
doses
of
radiation
and
through
the
years
all
hundred
of
them
died
except
Kori
Roshi
somehow
Kori
Roshi
kept
going
in fact
Kori
Roshi
was also
known
as a
healer
and
used to
teach
healing
to
just
a
handful
of
people
and
so
he
lived
his
whole
life
went
to
a
monastery
succeeded
in
the
dharmas
teacher
asked
him
not
to
become
a
monk
but
to
remain
a
lay
teacher
lay
Roshi
and
he
did
and
he
started
teaching
as a
lay
Roshi
and
finally
had
two
or
three
successors
and
started
getting
old
and
emaciated
and
ready
to
go
and
then
one
day
one
of
his
younger
students
came
to
visit
us
in
LA
and
we
asked
him
how
is
Kori
Roshi
doing
we
figured
he
would
say
he's
dead
or
a
couple
of
weeks
left
he said
he's
great
he's
up
and
around
he's
teaching
Kori
Roshi
brightness
was back
in his
face
his eyes
were
alive
and
the
monk
told
me
that
he
decided
that
he
couldn't
die
because
his
successes
were
too
old
to
find
any
new
successes
and
he
had
two
of
them
that
were
almost
finished
that
had
another
three
or
four
years
of
work
to
do
and
that
he
was
going
to
stick
around
long
enough
to
finish
it
up
with
them
he
did
and
for
a
teacher
being
very
very
concerned
that
the
Dharma
needs
to
go
on
to
the
next
generation
and
so
the
fourth
patriarch
said
you
you
you
too
old
and
I'm
afraid
that
you
know
you
don't
have
enough
time
to
study
Zen
they
didn't
have
weekend
enlightenments
in
those
days
it
took
longer
so
he
told
Saisho
that
he
should
be
reborn
to
study
Zen
and
so
Saisho
according
to the
story
borrowed
the
womb
of a
daughter
of the
Shu
family
and
was
born
again
without
a
father
later
when he
grew
up
he
met
the
fourth
patriarch
again
and
became
his
successor
the
fifth
patriarch
and
so
Master
Soju
again
is
bringing
up
that
old
legend
to
bring
home
the
point
that
the
true
body
the
true
self
doesn't
rely
on
paternal
relationship
he
used
two
examples
not
in
this
one
so
what
he
wants
us
to
do
is
to
see
into
that
cause
of
birth
that
exists
prior
to
the
life
of
our
parents
and
then
he
brings
them
all
together
these
three
points
Buddha's
hand
donkey's
hand
and
the
cause
of
birth
there
neither
Buddha
nor
Tao
nor
Zen
do
not
wonder
why
gateless
barriers
are so
difficult
they have
aroused
the monks
intense
animosity
the truth
is
is that
not only
is it
not
Buddha
not
Tao
not
Zen
it's not
even
the true
self
what it
is
is
words
concepts
ideas
as wonderful
as these
poems
are
so the
question
remains
what is
the truth
that's
beyond
the words
that's
the
gateless
barrier
of
Muman
and the
reason
the
gateless
barriers
are so
difficult
is because
it's in
our
head
there's
no
barrier
we
create
it
there's
no
barrier
but
yourself
there's
no
gate
but
yourself
and that's
why we
say
when the
barrier
comes up
be the
barrier
when you
be the
barrier
it means
to return
things
to the
self
it means
to acknowledge
responsibility
for the
barrier
there isn't a
damn thing
you can do
about it
if it's
caused by
something else
or somewhere
else
you say
he made
me angry
well it's
not my
fault
he made
me angry
there's
obviously
nothing you
can do
about anger
but when you
realize that he
can't make
you angry
only you can
make you
angry
then there's
something you
can do
about anger
that's the
way the
barrier
returns
to the
self
people
think
I'm
crazy
when they
say
you know
the pain
that they
get
and I
say
be the
pain
they look
at me
like I'm
half insane
just like I
looked at my
teacher like he
was half insane
when he told
me
to be
the pain
means the
pain fills
the whole
universe
there's
nothing outside
of it
there's no
longer a
reference
system
there's no
place to
stand
to evaluate
it look
at it
understand
it
categorize
it
systematize
it
because it's
your very
life itself
I'm completely
thrown off by
the time
thing now
when did
we start
when did I
start talking
1030
okay
should finish
up I guess
Muman was
lately at
Zugan
settling down
in the Zen
seat he
criticized
Kahn
old and
new
he cut
off the
ways for
both the
wise
in the
ordinary
a number
of dragons
in hiding
may stir
up a
peal of
thunder
those
dragons
in
hiding
are
enlightened
beings
Zen
practitioners
stirring
them up
is what
he was
doing
getting
them out
of their
quietude
mustering
up
their
activity
to be
manifested
in the
world
stir up
thunder
in the
Zen
world
and then
his last
line
he said
Master
Muman has
been invited
as leading
monk
and I
thank him
with this
humble poem
that's what
the whole
poem
was about
always
in Zen
practice
the teaching
takes place
everywhere
it's always
going on
the occasion
of a funeral
is an
opportunity
to teach
the occasion
of a
newborn
welcoming
ceremony
or a
marriage
ceremony
or
work
practice
a poem
of
gratitude
all of
these
things
are always
an
opportunity
to reveal
the dharma
to teach
and that's
what he was
doing here
thanks him
with this
humble poem
which
contains
like four
incredible
nanto
koans
for the
monks
to chew
on
for the
rest of
their lives
but that's
master
soju's
expression
of his
gratitude
how do
we thank
master
muman
how do
you
thank
master
muman
indeed
how do
we thank
all of
them
from
shakimuni
buddha
down
through
the
ages
mind
to
mind
face
to
face
86
generations
to
this
time
and
this
place
to
this
moment
in
your
life
how do
you
thank
them
there's
only one
way I
know
of
and
that's
to
realize
it
for
oneself
make
it
your
own
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
life
of
these
ancestors
that's
the
whole
reason
they
existed
it's
all
because
of
you
when
you
realize
it
you
give
life
to
the
Buddha
you
enlighten
the
Buddha
and
you
actualize
the
lives
of
each
of
those
ancestors
whose
name
we
chant
every
Sunday
so
be
intimate
with
the
ten
thousand
things
be
intimate
with
yourself
intimacy
consumes
this
great
universe
in its
entirety
every
speck
of
dust
every
star
every
planet
every
thought
every
face
taste
every
touch
everything
that
intimacy
is
prajna
wisdom
and
wisdom
in
activity
is
compassion
and
wisdom
and
compassion
is the
life
of all
the
Buddhas
and all
the
ancestors
it's
it's the
heartbeat
of this
mountain
of this
monastery
of our
practice
and it's
only a
sangha that
manifests
wisdom and
compassion
that can
create
an archive
of sanity
in this
troubled
world
so please
let's
take this
task
to realize
it
and to
actualize
it
as our
personal
responsibility
and let's
do it
