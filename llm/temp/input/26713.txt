The poem of Hanshans.
People ask the way to Cold Mountain.
Cold Mountain.
There is no through trail.
In summer the ice doesn't melt.
The rising sun blurs with swirling fog.
How did I make it?
My heart's not the same as yours.
If your heart was like mine, you'd be right here.
I think many of you are familiar with Hanshans.
He was a crazy man in about 600 A.D.
Very enlightened.
He hung around a monastery with Shitte,
basically making Dharma fools of just about everyone they ran into.
We have a kind of laughing, weird picture of the two of them
down at the base of the stairs as you go down to the bottom floor.
Hanshans has a very unusual way of teaching
and a very powerful one.
The mountain that he talks of as Cold Mountain
is basically the self, one self,
coming home, finding the way.
So the question is, people ask the way to Cold Mountain.
People ask the way home, the way to the way.
And as I was looking at this poem,
I realized this is basically what we hear in Guardian Council meetings
as students enter,
or prospective students try to enter the way here.
in as many ways as there are many of us,
we ask the way to Cold Mountain.
We want to know how to practice.
what is this way?
Why practice it all?
And how?
There's so many students who,
especially during the first koan,
are saying,
I don't know how hard to push myself.
Am I pushing myself too hard?
And I always want to say,
pushing what?
What are you worried about?
But that question,
that really basic anxiety,
is I think one of the things
we've all begun with in common here.
And I wanted to start there.
This last weekend,
someone said on their entry form,
they wanted to find the quickest way to enlightenment.
Others of us have put the most direct.
So what are we doing?
That anxiety.
One of the problems from the very start
is that the way we ask the question
tends to put it a little bit distant.
We want to accomplish the Buddha way.
That's another popular,
why do I want to become a Dushinji student answer?
I want to accomplish the Buddha way.
Or,
there's so much suffering in the world.
And it's true.
And it's
a motivation.
But it needs to come
closer to home
in order to really be
something that will
bring us all the way home.
It's got to be personal.
And as honest as
we go
to those Guardian Council meetings
ready to be,
we tend to do
exactly what we vow
we're not going to do.
We put on
our good student
mask.
I'm going to say
what a good student would say.
what
they probably want to hear.
And it takes a few minutes
each meeting
to kind of
let each other know
it's not necessary.
Let's just do
what's necessary here.
Let's not
add
any more
than we need to.
Jimong called it
simplicity
the other day.
Trungpa Rinpoche
used to call it
spiritual
elegance.
Just
straight.
Why do you want
to do this?
What do you want to do?
It takes
a lot
to stand out
in that hallway
after having
somehow
gotten through
Tongario
and read
the petition
that
each of us
read
I come here
realizing
the question
of life
and death
is a vital
matter.
I looked up
vital
and it
surprised me
all it means
is necessary.
It's a necessary
matter.
It's no longer
optional
to deal
with this.
The skimmying
around
from this
to that
is over.
I'm ready
to do it
and we walk
in the door.
where that
spirit goes
is part
of what
I want us
to look at
together today.
People
ask the way
to Cold
Mountain.
There's so
much in
that asking.
How do you
ask?
I ask
myself.
I ask
myself
whether I was
practicing my
koan this
morning
the way
I practiced
my first
koan.
Arriving
here
stripped
down to
necessary
everything else
exhausted.
Please
guide me
teach me
show me
I'm ready
to do it
sitting.
It gets dull
if you don't
keep asking
if you don't
ask
real
ceaselessly
what is it
what is it
what's this
struck me
that
one of the
things that
we do
is stop
seeing
what first
moved us
and it's
kind of like
we
notice
that
we've got
a huge
hole in the
middle of our
gut
we're dying
and then
we put
this little
sun visor
around our
neck
so we
can't look
down
anymore
and from
that moment
on we
can say
and do
and believe
anything
solved
everything's
fine
I don't
see a
problem
but there's
a part of
the mind
that feels
the anxiety
that has
a kind
of nagging
sense
of
can't you
get me
a glass
of water
has a
kind
of nagging
sense
that it's
possible
to waste
time
and that
above all
else
that's what
we don't
want to
do
though we're
no longer
quite
embraced
with why
what is
this
what's
the problem
the blinders
are on
and it
will work
for a
good while
we
especially
as we
first enter
into practice
are becoming
playful
with the
words of
the place
we play
at dharma
combat
we play
at
saying
things like
all things
are perfect
and complete
challenging
each other
and it's
it's useful
it's part
of the
process
but there
comes a
point
when a
more direct
response
is
necessary
thank you
it often
happens in
the middle
of session
when things
begin to
really feel
pretty bad
and your
knees are
hurting
and your
back is
hurting
and your
mind is
hurting
and suddenly
there's a
little crack
of doubt
that maybe
these people
don't know
what they're
talking about
and all
this isn't
necessary
maybe I
could accomplish
what I want
to accomplish
some other
way
you know
I've heard
there are other
places where
they're not
so mean
and they
don't make
you sit
still
and
maybe I'm
in the wrong
place
it begins
to kind
of work
on you
doubt's
like a
fungus
it's
it's
sneaky
the moment
it begins
to kind
of sprout
life
changes
suddenly
there are
more
options
than at
that necessary
moment when
you walked
in the door
vital
down to
what's
necessary
no room
for
anything
else
I
started
looking at
asking
in the
literature
you know
kind of
our
training
in what
what asking
is in
this
tradition
and it
really blew
me over
that
you know
it's so
clear
it said
over and
over and
over again
the quality
of that
asking
and a
real clear
description
of what
it's
not
there's a
koan
where a
monk
comes to
master
hogan
and he's
staying at
the temple
where hogan's
the teacher
and he
doesn't go
to doxan
he just
kind of
sits and
wanders
around
and after
a while
hogan
goes and
gets him
and says
what are
you doing
you're here
to train
and you're
not doing
anything
you're not
asking
and the
monk said
well
I had
satori under
my last
teacher
and I
really don't
have anything
left to
ask
and hogan
said
oh
what
what kind
of satori
did you
have
and the
monk said
well
I asked
the teacher
what is
buddha
and my
teacher
said
fire god
looks for
fire
and I
saw that
what he
said was
so
and that
was my
satori
fire god
looks for
fire
is
buddha
looks for
buddha
god
looks for
god
you're it
no problem
and hogan
looked at
him and
said
well that
just goes
to show
your so
called
satori
is fake
and turned
and walked
away from
him
and the
monk being
well versed
in the
zen
game
puffed up
got angry
and walked
out the
door
and shaking
his sleeves
enough of
this place
the master
there doesn't
know the
dharma
can't see
me
I don't
need this
and he
walks a
couple miles
down the
road
a couple
more miles
and the
fungus is
beginning to
grow in
his brain
what did
that mean
why did
he abuse
me so
severely
it wasn't
the way I
envisioned it
at all
I thought
I'd say
fire god
seeks for
fire and
he'd go
good
you know
you got
it
go set
up a
monastery
of your
own
didn't
he's
supposed to
be a
good teacher
and he
keeps
walking
miles
and miles
and the
doubts
growing
and growing
and growing
and finally
he stops
and says
what was
that
where did
I go
wrong
and he
comes back
and you're
not told in
the story
how long
he was on
the road
but you get
the sense
from the
state of
mind that
walked back
into that
monastery
that it
took some
time
fungus was
full grown
by the time
he got back
in front of
the teacher
and he was
wide open
and said
please teach
me
what did
I do
wrong
where's
my fault
and the
teacher said
ask me
and the
student said
what is
Buddha
what is
the one
that wakes
what is
it to be
awake
free
realized
the question
of life
and death
what is
Buddha
and Hogan
said
the fire
God
looks
for
fire
I used
to hate
koans
like
this
what was
different
there's
another
one
where
Kyogen
and
Isan
are
together
and
Isan
says
give me
one word
of your
own
of
yourself
before
you were
born
of the
time
before
east
and west
were
distinguished
what is
that
and
Kyogen
went
back and
sat
and he
came back
hundreds
and hundreds
and hundreds
of time
presenting
his
idea
of what
was being
talked
about
his
strongest
sitting
his
deepest
realization
and every
time
Isan
would say
that's
not it
that's
not it
and
Kyogen
eventually
just got
really
funked
out
depressed
left
the
monastery
and
started
reading
reading
everything
he could
get his
hands
on
studying
the sutras
studying
the philosophies
trying to
figure out
what the
hell
is this
man
talking
about
what is
it
intent
totally
asking
never a
moment
when that
asking
isn't
functioning
he's
sweeping
out in
the yard
small
stone
it's
a stick
of
bamboo
sky
opens
up
for him
what
was
that
what
did
he
see
what
was
realized
it's
really
important
that we
get
this
asking
clear
on
cold
mountain
there's
no
through
trail
Hanshan
says
there's
no
through
trail
there's
no
discernible
path
the
way
of
no
way
no
way
no
path
in a
sense
what's
being
said
is
you
have
to
cut
your
own
way
in
another
sense
what's
being
said
is
that
it's
possible
to
get
lost
trail
is
difficult
it's
non
existent
you're
alone
here
you're
looking
no
through
trail
began
to
look
at
how
we
get
lost
we
stand
at the
door
and say
please
guide
me
in my
practice
I
want
to
follow
the
rules
of
this
temple
I
want
to
use
the
upaya
that
are
here
the
forms
that
are
used
at
this
place
to
realize
myself
and we
come into
the room
and someone
says
don't bow
that way
bow
this way
and up
to a
point
we
agree
okay
I'll do
it
your way
you like
the hands
up here
not the
hands
down
here
whatever
you say
lady
I want
to sit
here
but there's
a line
drawn
and you
don't cross
that line
is the
message
that the
student
gives
I'll
got
show
this is
the way
I got
show
you want
it up
here
okay
next service
it's
down
here
what
what are
we
saying
you can
see it
in people's
eyes
when you're
giving
instruction
there's a
point at
which
suddenly
the
bullshit
meter
comes
up
and they're
looking at
you and
they're either
angry
because obviously
you're caught
up in this
leftover
Asian
anal
you know
preoccupation
with form
and I'm
here to
realize
myself
and I've
got to get
through you
monitor
or
we go
trippy
you know
okay
gosh
I
see it
I'll do it
and we walk
like angels
around the
room
you know
and our feet
barely make a
sound
and
we pay
minute
attention
to
every
physical
facet
of the
bow
and we
put our
face
into
the
sincere
student
chanting
face
when it's
time for
service
it's still
not it
you know
where's the
balance
where do we
find out
for ourselves
what
God show
really is
it's really
easy
you know
we're
we're very
cautious about
not getting
caught in the
funny forms
some of us
we don't want
to look weird
and we're
very anxious
to get to
the point
where we're
saying
God my
handshake
is my
gosh
show
you know
the way
I say
hello
is my
gosh
show
gosh
show
penetrates
everything
I do
but you
have to
visit
gosh
mountain
first
you have
to realize
gosh
show
before you
can start
really
honestly
practicing
gosh
show in
every moment
every aspect
every form
what is it
where do we
draw the line
something to
watch
gosh
show
is
physical
specific
personal
intimate
it's a
fist length
in front
of the
nose
fingertips
line up
with the
tip of
the nose
fingers
are held
together
not spread
out
in the
gosh
show
we use
here
the elbows
are held
up
not down
not out
not hiding
not worshipping
kasha
just that
do it
that way
how does
it feel
did you
feel a line
did you
feel a line
what is
it
snow
through
trail
lostness
there's
a
book
that
several
of us
have been
reading
and it's
been quoted
already in a
couple of
dharma talks
called the
tracker
by tom
brown
and it's
a really
wonderful
book
and in
one section
he talks
about
lostness
what that
is
and
his
basic
gestalt
is the
woods
the
wilderness
hearing
seeing
all of
that
so you
turn to
this
chapter
and you
think
you're
going to
get
what to
do
when you've
lost
the
landmarks
and you're
out in
the bush
and you don't
know how to
get home
but let me
read to you
what he calls
true lostness
he's talking
about a
friend of
his
who
throughout
the book
you meet
as the
one person
who really
shares
and can
see and
hear
tom
there
bonded
in a way
that's really
rare
he says
true lostness
had nothing
to do
with the
woods
or the
wilderness
in fact
the times
I've been
most truly
lost in
my life
I was
almost
always
living
outside the
woods
and
true lostness
is when
you've forgotten
the spiritual
center of
your life
when your
values have
gotten so
warped with
time
that you
don't remember
what's truly
important
with Rick and
me
it happened
with skulls
I love that
happened with
skulls
in the beginning
the skulls
were treasures
brought back
to remind us
of the great
adventures
or the
vastness
of what the
woods had
to teach us
the center
of our lives
was the
understanding
of nature
skulls
were a part
of our
study
we collected
them
identified
them
analyzed
them
they were
a part
of the woods
that we could
carry around
with us
into school
at home
anywhere we
needed
when city
life and
permanent rules
crowded in on us
we needed a piece
of nature
to sustain us
skulls were
good medicine
something sacred
because of its
correspondence
with something
greater
the skulls
were a direct
link with nature
that kept us
in contact
with the true
center of our
lives
the process
by which
we lost
that link
was gradual
and I doubt
that even
an introspective
adult would
have noticed
it
it occurred
because we
focused so
intently
on the skulls
that they took
on an importance
in themselves
and not for
what they could
teach us
about nature
gradually we
stopped
collecting
specimens of
nature
and started
collecting
skulls
it was not
long after
that that
we began
to spend
more time
at home
with our
collections
than out
in the woods
collecting
when we
went out
in the woods
we couldn't
get out
of the back
of our minds
that we
might find
a skull
when one
of us
did find
one
the other
was happy
for him
but envious
inevitably
we came
to the
perfect skull
and both
of us
reached for
it at once
we argued
of course
the greed
for skulls
making us
blind to
anything else
I let him
pick it up
having no idea
he would try
to claim it
he picked it up
thinking I was
acknowledging his
right to keep it
we fought over
it all the way
home
and when Rick
took it into
his house
with him
after an
especially
bitter exchange
we were no
longer speaking
to each other
for a while
our collection
sustained us
we went every
day to school
on the same
bus but we
never talked
except to
taunt one
another with
the number
of skulls
in our
collections
or the
rarity
of a skull
we just
found
when we
passed each
other in
the woods
we didn't
even nod
and we
passed each
other continually
because we
were constantly
in the woods
then he
goes on to
talk about
how they
eventually
got shook
out of the
stupidity
that they'd
fallen into
this training
this training
that we're
in
not only
allows us
to get
lost like
that
in a sense
it actually
encourages us
to
to really
see how
we can
get lost
and there's
there's that
vital matter
at the
core of our
relationship
with each
other here
and yet
still
most people
keep track
of who's
on the
Rio
Bon
and whether
there was
some mistake
in the
seniority
the Eno's
really screwing
up
in the
training
there are
also
koans
where you'll
see teachers
purposefully
kind of
getting those
kind of
points
the one
about the
two monks
and the
blinds
is a
perfect
example
the monk
point
the teacher
points to
the blinds
and says
roll those
up
two monks
jump up
each rolls
up a
blind
the teacher
says
one of
them's
got it
one of
them
doesn't
who's
right
who's
wrong
who's
ahead
who's
comparing
who's
lost
one of
the ways
that
is used
a lot
here
to
show us
whether
we're
lost
because
sometimes
it
it's
difficult
thing
to be
aware
of
is
kind
of
the
time
whip
every
night
at the
end
of
the
day
when
it's
not
session
the
time
keeper
sings
out
time
is
swiftly
passing
by
opportunities
get
lost
don't
squander
your
life
monitor
will
yell
out
don't
sit
as if
you're
going
to
live
forever
this
moment
and you
begin
to see
really
clearly
what
we've
left
without
taking
care
of
it
properly
I
sometimes
look at
my life
and say
what would
I need
to take
care of
if I
knew
I only
had
one more
hour
to live
how many
conversations
have I
left
unfinished
how many
relationships
not
appreciated
now we
say this is
about being
ready to
die
appreciating
everything
moment to
moment
fully
completely
it's a
very
challenging
practice
to actually
live that
way
and I
think
it's
important
to
test it
test it
for
yourself
ask
yourself
when
that
evening
gotha
gets
said
each
night
what
happens
what
happens
in your
mind
opportunities
are
lost
it's
also
very
humbling
to
practice
that
if you
feel
ever
that
you're
accomplishing
some
great
thing
in
enduring
a couple
periods
of
zazen
ask
yourself
really
honestly
and see
if you're
lost
next line
in
Hanshan's
poem
is
in
summer
the
ice
doesn't
melt
Genpo
Sensei
talks
about
people
as
water
in
one
of
his
books
and
he
says
we
can
see
ourselves
as
gas
or
liquid
or
solid
and
see
ourselves
as
gas
that's
kind
of
the
absolute
we
pervade
everywhere
it's
hard
to
find
our
edges
see
ourselves
as
liquid
able
to
flow
into
any
circumstance
water
or
we
can
be
ice
solid
rigid
stuck
clinging
to
every
other
object
that
we
come
to
and
he
simply
wonders
in his
talk
I wonder
why
we
prefer
to be
ice
doesn't
gas
sound
good
doesn't
water
sound
great
why
do
we
become
ice
even
in
summer
the
ice
doesn't
melt
whether
you
see
the
ice
is
on
the
mountain
or
the
ice
is
on
your
heart
isn't
it
incredible
we
sit
here
together
in
one
of
the
most
open
trusting
driving
spaces
on
earth
probably
and
still
we're
iced
up
you
know
there's
something
resisting
the lines
there
I remember
my first
session
it was an
ongo session
so it was
very
hot
you know
very
driving
and
in the
middle of
the
afternoon
dairishi
comes into
the room
and says
one of the
practices
in zen
is to
chant
moo
and he
starts
this
tremendous
chanting
and the
whole
zendo
fills
up
with
these
moo
weird
compelling
sounds
everybody
just
coming
from
their
horror
and the
harmonies
and the
echoes
and the
tears
and everybody
is chanting
and it's
kind of that
breaking down
of the
edges
and I
started
crying
uncontrollably
and I
couldn't
chant
I'd start
to chant
and it
would just
like
choke
in my
throat
like
no
I
won't
what is
that
I've seen
it in
other
people
I've seen
it in
the way
we sit
and we
get right
on the
edge
of just
and say
no
back off
draw the
line
don't cross
that line
this isn't
summer
this isn't
the heat
one of the
students who
was in
residence
for a
couple
of years
used to
constantly
say
I don't
understand
why it's
so hard
why does
it have
to be
so hard
why can't
it just
be
it's
natural
right
why does
it have
to feel
so bad
it hurts
so much
I don't
like it
it hurts
I really
don't want
to do it
why does
it have
to hurt
it should
come
like this
and after
a while
we all
got to
where we
just kind
of like
are you
going to
do it
do it
you know
but it
did make
me look
at
why does
it have
to be
so hard
why
and it
damn you
died
what jumped
into my
mind
was
zen
fang
for those
of you
who have
seen
the famous
movie
it's the
video history
of rats
infesting
the compost
heap
and
it's a
incredible
story of
heroism
and
valor
on the
part of
Lobo
who
saved us
from being
overrun
there was
a period
when the
compost heap
was being
mismanaged
and the
rats infested
it
so basically
every day
we would
feed the
rats
feed them
nourish them
make them
strong
let them feel
their right
to be
and thrive
grow
rats
three times
a day
here's your
food
and
the point
of the
movie
was that
Lobo
vanquished
them
you know
these
dive bombing
rats
who would
leap at
his throat
and he
would put
an end
to them
in a
compassionate
way
very quickly
and skillfully
but
the reason
they popped
my mind
was that
I think
that's why
it's so hard
because we
feed
our rats
all the time
we fed
them
for years
we fed
I am
rats
I am
strong
I'm smart
I ought to
be able to
do this
rat
we fed
I'm really
stupider than
most people
and I make
a lot of
mistakes
and I
probably
don't even
belong here
rat
and we fed
it shouldn't
be this
hard
rat
if you
listen to
your mind
during session
they're running
all over the
place
they're very
familiar
they're getting
stronger and
stronger
every time
we give
them
the nourishment
of our
attention
just like
anything
we give
our attention
to
for a
couple of
months
years ago
I was in
physical
therapy
and it
began
kind of
like
we began
practice
you know
where you're
you're going
to be a
good student
I was going
to be a
good patient
and I
practiced
kind of
Pollyanna
physical therapy
for a couple
of weeks
where I'd
go in
and I'd be
really hurting
and they
would do
all this
horrible
stuff to
me
and I'd
say
but isn't
it a
beautiful
morning
you know
isn't it
a great
day
and besides
it feels
so good
when you
stop
you know
all the
positive
stuff I
could find
I would
like
say
and then I
moved on
to liver
practice
like we do
in Zen
training
it really
feels bad
therefore it
must be
really good
for me
and I
would say
those things
you know
boy it's
really hurting
this morning
I must
really be
getting
somewhere
you must
really care
about me
the better
I'm paying
you much
too well
you know
and I'd
say all
these good
patient
things
and then
one morning
it kind
of broke
you know
I wasn't
getting any
better
I didn't
think
and like
the therapist
anymore
the buzz
of being a
good patient
was gone
like the buzz
you know
I'm a Zen
student
I meditate
you know
goes after
a while
and I was
just pissed
you know
I was just
pissed
and
the way I
tend to get
pissed is I
get philosophical
about it
because I
don't like to
allow myself
to be pissed
so the
therapist comes
in and starts
working on me
and says
how are you
doing
and I said
well
you know
I really
begin to
wonder
you know
maybe
I'm just
meant to
be
like this
you know
I'm just
this is the
state of
being
you know
it's natural
disease is
natural
you know
I just
need to
learn to
be
kind of
mangled
like this
you know
this is
just
the way
it is
you know
and the
therapist
and it
was like
backed
off
took his
hands
off my
back
and said
fine
be a
cripple
and walked
out of
the room
and I
felt a
little bit
like
Miss Piggy
in the
Muppet
movie
when she
sang
that's
not what
I meant
that's
not what
I meant
at all
you know
it was
like
you know
and then
I was
left
and I was
like
now
what
what
it hurts
who's
going to
take care
of it
what am I
going to
do
I'm all
alone
here
there's
no
trail
good
therapists
good
physical
therapists
are
probably
some of
the greatest
Zen
masters
in the
world
because
they know
the value
of leaving
you on
your own
they can't
do it
for you
and they've
got to
get that
oomph
in the
person
they're
working
with
we hear
it all
the times
in the
koans
and then
we don't
recognize
it
when it's
happening
with us
we go
in to
interview
and we're
full of
ourselves
or we're
depressed
and we're
saying I
just I
really don't
know whether
this is the
right practice
for me
Daya
you know
I've
always been
attracted to
Christian mysticism
and you know
besides I'm
not sure
about the
liturgy
you know
and Daya
says fine
go
be out
by Wednesday
don't waste
my time
that's not
what I'm
in at all
I wanted
you to
get into
my drama
with me
great
doubt
great
asking
no trail
it
it's not
comfortable
I think
it's only
recently for
me
begun to
kind of
come true
that
if we're
not ready
to do it
we're wearing
the wrong
robes
you know
lots of
places to
go
lots of
things to
do
this
practice
this
place
this
mountain
this
teacher
this
order
is
only
for those
for whom
it's
necessary
it's not
necessary
go
go
no big
deal
if it's
necessary
then you
do
how did
I make
it
Hans
John
said
my heart's
not the
same as
yours
if your
heart was
like mine
you would
be right
here
10th
anniversary
we passed
out
little t-shirts
with dragons
on them
breaking out
of shells
and emblazoned
around this
zen circle
where the
words birth
of the
dragon
10th
anniversary
celebration
and I
I remember
taking mine
to my room
and kind of
just looking
at it
because we
didn't talk
about it
much
as a
sangha
say
birth
of what
dragon
where
and I
felt very
much like
when I
received
my rock
suit
the first
time
because it
seems to me
like there's
a vow
in putting
on that
shirt
Hans
Sean
says
your heart
is not
the same
as mine
what is
he saying
isn't it
all one
don't we
all have
the Buddha
mind
Hans
Sean's
heart
mind
of the
way
Shakyamuni
holds up
a flower
nobody gets
it
everybody's
silent
Kasho
smiles
Shakyamuni
says
I have
the
incomparable
mind
of nirvana
exquisite
teachings
of formless
form
I give
them now
to Kasho
and the
koan
of that
is
if
everyone
already
has the
Buddha
mind
why
did
only
Kasho
get the
flower
if
everybody
doesn't
already
have it
and there's
nothing to
transmit
and it's
all silly
then why
bother at
all
is this
just
some
big
game
but I
think we
sense it
I think
everyone
who
is here
is doing
the
students
only
session
has heard
that
heart
and wondered
what it
means
your heart
is not
the same
as mine
and
know
that
when
my
heart
is the
same
as the
heart
of
Han
Sean
I'll
have
found
cold
mountain
you
have
found
cold
mountain
it only
takes a
moment
we hear
that over
and over
again
too
one
moment
it's
all it
takes
but it's
a
particular
kind
of
moment
and that's
what gets
missed
it's a
moment
that
acknowledges
the ice
that doesn't
melt even
in the
summer
and it
acknowledges
it in a
particular
kind of
way
it's a
way that
kind of
takes
the
rats
and
breathes
fire
into
them
and
rather than
frying into
little
crisp
rats
they turn
into
dragons
I said
yesterday
as
a kind
of
encouragement
before
evening
service
that
one of
the ways
energy
is created
transformed
is with
breath
if you've
ever studied
chinese medicine
that's one of
the teachings
energy comes
from food
from sleep
from breath
you put
your breath
where your
heart is
I wanted
to
end this
with a
kind of
a proposal
we've each
gotten a
challenge
we've gotten
it in the
form of
walking in
this door
receiving this
mountain
receiving this
teaching
receiving this
stupid little
white t-shirt
with the
red dragon
climbing out
of a shell
and we've
asked
in a way
I think
we need
to ask
again
each of
us
among
asked
gensha
I'm new
here
how can I
enter
zen
and gensha
said
do you
hear the
the murmuring
of the
mountain
stream
and gensha
said
yeah
I hear
it
monks
said
yeah
I hear
it
gensha
said
enter
there
it's
critical
necessary
that we
not
be what's
called in
this tradition
dragon heads
with snake
tails
what's it
necessary
to
is
our
life
it doesn't
matter to
Dino
it doesn't
matter to
Shakyamuni
matters because
one day
you can't
look away
the pain's
your own
the asking's
your own
and either
that dragon
breath
dragon mind
dragon heart
is our
own
or we
squander
our life
we squander
that possibility
so let's
do it
let's
ask
let's
ask this
session
ask each
other and
ask ourselves
what's the
heart of
Han Shan
where's
cold
mountain
how
do you
ask
I'll see you next time.
