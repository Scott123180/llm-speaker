From the Faith Mind Sutra by Sangstan.
The great way is not difficult for those who have no preferences.
When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised.
Make the smallest distinction, however, in heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.
If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinions for or against anything.
To set up what you like against what you dislike is the disease of the mind.
When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
If any of you were expecting Dido here today, you're not alone.
I think there was some karma in him talking about the vomiting dwarf yesterday
because he's got the disease but bad and is, for the first time in ten years,
knocked down in the middle of a session.
It occurred to me it was a little bit like Vimalakirti being sick because all sentient beings are sick,
but I think Dido's sick because he's been in the interview room with the whole sangha this week.
And it sounds like most of us are sick, so it got him.
Since I wasn't expecting to give a talk, I thought I'd give a talk on expectation and come from the heart of where I was.
I thought it was, in a way, a wonderful opportunity, in a way, a wonderful opportunity to look at expectation
because of also what Dido she alluded to yesterday as a kind of sangha phenomena
that we tend to have a lot of expectations about what the teacher should do,
what the practice should look like,
students feeling like they're not getting their money's worth if there's not interview every time they're here.
And his working with that in himself and with the sangha.
And I thought we should do some of that work on our own together.
So I thought we could look at expectation in terms of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the sangha.
Buddha, as everyone's heard, means the one that wakes up, the enlightened one.
It also, in Zen, is used to refer to the teacher,
the one who is the manifested form of the one that wakes up.
And, by extension, ourselves, the kind of embodiment of the one that wakes up, the person.
And practice, in a sense, is to realize that person as oneself,
to realize the teacher as oneself, the Buddha as oneself.
So what do we expect of the Buddha, of the teacher?
It occurred to me that usually the questions and expectations around this area are kind of indirect.
They're kind of questions underneath questions.
One of the most popular ones around here is,
Why does Dido smoke?
And what's implied in that, if you look at it, is a question underneath.
You know, is he free?
Or is he bound?
And if he's bound, then does this training work?
And, does this training work means, will it work for me?
Will I be able to get free doing this?
Does, why does Dido smoke?
So you have to kind of listen to the questions in a different way, I find.
What they seem to bring up, usually, is a fear that it's really not possible to do this, to realize ourselves.
And because that's a very anxious-making kind of questioning,
we put that distance between it and our real question.
This weekend, last weekend at the Zen training weekend,
a woman who was just the first time encountering Zen,
but a really kind of hot mind, really asking,
at the group discussion period said,
how come, you know, they say that Zen has kind of penetrated the culture of Japan?
You know, that the Zen way is so coupled with the Japanese way
that they're almost indistinguishable.
And yet, to my eye, she says, you know,
Japanese culture has a lot of problems,
a lot of serious problems with competitiveness and aggression.
And she had this whole laundry list of how bad the Japanese were.
Excuse me.
And if Zen is there, then why is that there?
Or in other words, you know, does it work?
If I do this, will I end up competitive, aggressive, and screwed up,
or will I be free?
You know, I don't want to, before I put my 20 years in, 30 years in,
I want to know what the outcome's going to be.
It's been there for a long time.
I don't like what I see.
And it really struck me when she was talking.
It felt like a very familiar kind of asking in my life
because that's the way I encountered Christianity
with that looking at it and saying, you know,
I don't see anyone whose life I would want to completely identify with.
And it's, you know, it's a teaching, very, you know, chauvinistic.
And how can they base a tradition on that kind of love
and exclude half the human race?
Obviously there's something wrong with this tradition.
And it was a revolution to me that when this woman asked the question at the workshop,
suddenly I was vehemently responding to her
that there's no tradition.
You know, there's nothing that says because you put on a raksu that you're a Buddhist,
because you live in a Zen culture that you practice,
that it is rare.
It's probably rare throughout time that people actually do what they say in religious practice.
So who knows what could be if a whole culture did Zazen every day,
looked at their lives, looked at how they moved and intermingled one among each other.
I think that's our opportunity here as a Sangha to explore that.
But I wanted to point it out just to look at how the questions get asked
and what we expect from Buddhism and Zen and from that one.
In a sense, a lot of the koan questions are expectations.
You know, if all things are one, then why are there special things we do?
Special robes, special places, special practices.
Why do we have to do anything if everything is one?
It's the same question as who am I?
What should I do with my life?
If it's perfect, if that's what I'm being told and taught,
then what do I do?
What do I express?
In Zen, as you all know, especially after this week,
those questions always get bounced right back.
If all things are one, why do we have to practice?
Sit still.
Look to yourself.
Drop the thought.
Have no preferences.
It's very subtle how the ideas come up.
It seems like they emerge constantly.
The moment we notice it, we've separated from it.
The moment we notice the teacher, the practice, life, the raindrops,
that distance has appeared.
And suddenly, with that distance, comes like and dislike
and all the problems that pursue from that.
When the deep meaning of things is not understood,
the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
Daito, she talks about intimate practice a lot.
It's kind of the key word, in a sense, of his teaching, intimate.
Be intimate with yourself, with your life, with your barriers.
And still, you know, we hear it, and we still look outside.
You know, we make this commitment to be students.
And we enter kind of a honeymoon period where we like Daito.
You know, he's a nice guy.
He's funny.
And he's a wonderful speaker.
And he's a compassionate teacher.
And he's got a lot to give in a certain way.
And then the honeymoon one day is over.
And he does something that strikes us as unfair,
either with us or with someone else.
Usually it's with someone else.
He treated them wrongly.
And we get defensive and begin looking at it in a very distant kind of way.
And in a sense, that's necessary.
You know, the honeymoon shouldn't last forever.
Or the relationship never grows up.
In a way, you have to leave home before you can come home.
And it goes through all sorts of kind of rangy times for most of us.
It can be over any issue.
Usually it's some issue that we have difficulty with.
For me, it was anger.
However, I considered Daito, she a very angry man.
And his way of expressing himself as just kind of over that line a lot.
And it took a long time to begin to not just say the good student things.
Well, this is obviously part of the teaching and he's really working on this.
But to be able to feel it as what it was.
So we move slowly, I think, into a more mature, real commitment.
Where it continues to get tested.
You know, in a sense, the expectations help us.
Because they express our faith in a way that something can happen.
It's possible.
Like Shugan said this morning.
Many have gone before us.
And they've used this way.
They've accomplished themselves.
It's possible.
That's the faith mind.
It's possible.
Like the third noble truth.
It's possible to put an end to suffering.
Actual people have realized their lives.
And then there's the doubt that begins to clarify that faith.
It, I think, passes us by sometimes that that's necessary.
That when we don't let those things come up.
When we don't acknowledge our questions.
That we miss an opportunity to really see what that question is.
To see the question underneath the question.
It's also not a stupid kind of devotion in Zen.
There's simply a shifting concentration that begins to happen.
That instead of describing and liking or disliking the other's personality.
We shift to begin to concentrate on what are we doing with that.
What is that?
Where is that?
Is it in someone else or in us?
And then we begin to make real the possibility to do something about it.
I couldn't change what I saw as Daito's anger.
We can't change what we see as anybody else's problem.
We can't move it in any way.
It works.
Mizumi Roshi, Genpo Sensei, Daito's Dharma brother, quotes him as
having made a vow years ago to always put the needs of others before his own needs.
And it really struck me when I first heard that.
It is just kind of simply put and beautiful.
And especially having seen what Mizumi Roshi has been through in the last five years.
where his own life has been really put under the microscope.
You know, he's had a lot of problems in his sangha and with drinking and with relationships.
And I think most of us are somewhat aware of that.
And I was thinking of that yesterday when Daito mentioned about the dwarf being remembered
as a kind of, you know, ornery, weird guy.
That what we tend to remember about people are, you know,
that they snuck under the high seat, you know,
or that they had a problem with drinking.
And that there's, you know, a whole vast world of moment-to-moment practice
that no one else is ever aware of.
You know, it's the same way we're aware of each other.
You know, we're aware of when someone moves in the zendo.
Are we as aware of the 20 minutes that went before
when they were on the edge of the greatest pain they've ever been in
and didn't move?
You know, I think that's one of the constant lessons to me
of being in the sangha, which is supposed to be a later part of the talk
when I get into sangha rather than Buddha.
But it, I think, is critical in terms of looking at that one
that wakes up and what we expect of it.
Because we do it to ourself.
We do remember, you know,
I forgot to put out the candle during service.
And the monitor had to yell at me.
And I'm probably just too much of a self-concerned space cadet
to even be here.
I'm never going to wake up.
And we don't remember the half hour we just sat,
the intensity with which we moved,
the, you know, totality with which we folded our Raksu.
So, you know, it's a very private practice.
And getting, in a way, involved with saying,
I've done good or I've done rotten is the problem.
Having no preferences, not even looking, is very difficult.
It's very ceaseless.
And it's probably more and more important
as we progress in our practice
that we keep the focus on what we're doing.
Because it gets, in a certain way, harder and harder
when we're students to keep that focus.
To not want to say what the sangha should be doing
or the teacher should be doing when the honeymoon's over
and our practice is hurting.
The way is perfect like vast space, Sangston says,
where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.
Indeed, it's due to our choosing to accept or reject
that we don't see the true nature of things.
Live neither in the entanglements of outer things
nor in inner feelings of emptiness.
Be serene in the oneness of things.
And such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.
When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity,
your very effort fills you with activity.
As long as you remain in one extreme or another,
you'll never know oneness.
Those who don't live in the single way
fail in both activity and passivity,
assertion and denial.
To deny the reality of things is to miss their reality.
To assert the emptiness of things
is to miss their reality.
Dharma, as we look at it in this training,
is the relative things, the whole world, the teachings.
And it's where most of our sense of training happens.
It's where we come up against what I wanted to do
and what I didn't want to do.
We look at the aspects of training here.
And it's so obvious on a moment-to-moment basis
is how this comes up.
For me still, the most difficult dharma, in a sense,
is 4.30 a.m.
I don't want to get up.
I don't want to.
It's nice here.
And moving out of it is a tremendous leap.
Because, at that moment,
I have an expectation
and a definition of who I am,
what the moment is, and where I'm going.
Dado says,
you miss your moment,
and you miss the moment,
and you miss your life.
It's when it gets really kind of fine
into those moments
where I begin to see
how the dharma training works,
the teaching of moment-after-moment things,
forms.
It's almost like there has to be that resistance
that I don't want
for a while
in order to see how it can open up
to be able to experience
when you don't resist,
when you just do it.
And the sense of that.
David Reynolds was here
a week or two ago.
He's a Western teacher
of a Japanese therapy called Morita.
And he's come for a couple of years.
He did a retreat here
about two years ago.
And it was an unusual kind of experience
for a lot of people
because a lot of what he says
incorporates Zen training.
A lot of that kind of therapy does.
But there's a point in it
where
he distinguishes
what you do
from what you feel about it.
He says,
there's something you can do
about your activity.
There's nothing you can do
about your feeling.
And
for most of the Sangha
when he was here,
that became a real
kind of point of departure
because a feeling is a thing.
We create it
just like we create a thought,
just like we create an activity.
Though the spirit
of what he's suggesting
and teaching people
is very strong.
When he was here
two weeks ago,
I was talking with him
and
he was kind of giving me
the rundown
of his teaching schedule.
And he's all over the world.
It's getting very successful.
And it's talk
after talk
after talk.
And he said,
what are you doing?
And I said,
well,
you know,
Dido's kind of
making me give talks.
And I'm looking at
how that feels.
And I'm doing it.
But I'm seeing
that a lot of the time
it doesn't
feel good.
And
I'm just looking at that.
You know.
And he says,
well,
you can't do anything
about that.
All you can do
is just do it.
That's what I do.
I hate giving talks.
And
and I said,
but
do you want to go
your whole life
hating
what you're doing?
And I said,
you know,
it doesn't make any sense to me.
And I said,
if
I can get clear enough
on what I'm seeing
while I'm sitting,
what I'm
moving into
in liturgy,
what my
entire
seven years
of training here
has shown me,
you know,
that there's
no separation
between
who I am
and who I'm
talking to
and silence
and speech,
then there's
no need
for this feeling
of good
or bad
or anything.
You know,
I know that.
I need to realize that,
but I'm
going to do it.
You know.
And it
really struck me
that that's
the Dharma
teaching for me.
You know,
this,
the teaching of
this
right now.
and
also
the danger
of that,
the kind
of disease
of
this.
One of the
stinkiest
parts of
Zen training
is the disease
of this.
You know,
we get into
thusness
and get stuck
in this
is it.
This is
reality,
the teaching
kind of
blocking
around it
and
there's
a wonderful
koan
where
a student's
dealing with
that and
says,
you know,
reality is
like vast
space.
The Dharma
body is
like vast
space,
penetrates
everywhere,
and yet
it
manifests
in response
to beings
like the
moon
in water.
How do
you express
that
response?
And
the student
says,
it's like
a donkey
looking at
a well.
Very
kind of
this.
It's a
donkey
standing
there
looking
at
a
well.
And
the
teacher
says,
that's
good,
but it's
still
only 80%.
And
the student
says,
well,
what about
you?
What do
you have
to say?
And
the
expectation
at that
moment is
that the
teacher's
going to
present a
great
shout
or
some
way of
expressing
the
absolute
basis,
no eye,
ear,
nose,
tongue,
body,
mind.
What the
teacher says
is the
well
looking at
the ass,
looking at
the donkey.
And it's a
teaching in
nothing's
missing,
nothing's
excluded
from
the
Dharma.
one.
But
the
more you
talk and
think
about
it,
the
further
astray
you
wander
from
the
truth.
Stop
talking and
thinking and
there will
be nothing
you won't
be able
to know.
And
this is
where it
came up
for me
how the
Sangha
works,
that we
have an
unusual
kind of
friendship,
if you
will,
here,
that
causes us
a lot of
disappointment
and pain
because it
doesn't work
in the way
any other
kind of
bond
works
because we
don't
support each
other in
the way
we're used
to being
supported.
A lot
of the
ego
stroking
that keeps
people together
is absent
here.
We don't
tend to
relate
in that
way.
I was
remembering
years ago
when
having
dinner
with a
man I
was dating
who had
some
foreign
students
and they
said to
him,
tell her
she's
very
beautiful
and
kind of
beamed
and
he told
me this,
they say
you're very
beautiful,
all excited
with telling
me this
and I
said oh
and went
on to
something
else in
the
conversation
and later
he said
that was
very rude
the way
you responded
to that,
they were
paying you
a compliment
and I
said it
doesn't
make any
sense,
I don't
have anything
to do
with that,
you know,
you're
beautiful,
you're
ugly,
you look
good,
you look
bad,
you know,
I,
in another
culture would
be ugly,
you know,
in 20
years they
won't have
anything to
talk to
me about,
you know,
there's no
basis here
for relationship,
there's just
this odd
encounter,
it's as if
they said
what a
lovely flower
and expected
me to say
thank you,
in a sense
that's true,
but at the
time it
just was
puzzling
to me,
and it
occurred to
me that
that's one
of the
things
wonderfully
lacking
here,
we don't
tend to
spend a
lot of
time in
the things
that aren't
necessary
about one
another,
you know,
that the
core of
how we
work together
and relate
to each
other,
is at
that bottom
line of
what we're
doing,
who we
are,
why we're
here,
and a
lot of the
people who
have left
this sangha
over the
last ten
years,
have left
partly because
those things
are missing,
and appearances
are one
thing that
might not
talk to
everyone,
but also
respect,
respect for
each other's
intellect and
accomplishment,
it's a very
unusual world
we enter into
here as a
sangha,
and we come
in and we're
accomplished
people,
or we have
sparkly minds,
and no one
says,
what a great
idea,
or,
boy,
I've never
talked with a
Supreme Court
lawyer before,
what's your
life like?
We seldom
stroke each
other's
accomplishments.
What we
stroke is
the silent
appreciation of
the person
sitting on
either side
of us,
who did
it,
who sat,
who is
doing it,
who's making
it possible
for us to
stay with
our
practice.
But we've
lost a lot
of people.
We've lost
a lot of
seniors.
The fact
that today
Daito has
the flu,
it's no big
deal.
It's a big
deal to him,
but it's
essentially no
big deal.
He was
really cute.
I said,
what about
the talk?
And he
says,
he told
Shuko,
no talk,
just sit.
I took him
a cup of
tea.
I said,
what about
the talk?
Are you
feeling any
better?
And he
says,
do it.
Even when
he's dying,
he's doing it.
But it
occurred to me
that someday
it's not going
to be the
flu.
It's going
to be
no more
teacher.
What's it
going to
feel like?
We're going
to walk
in here
one afternoon,
one morning,
one evening
for Zazen
and the
word will
come or
Dada will
fall over
or whatever
and the
teacher's
gone.
And it's
something he's
doing everything
he can do
to prepare us
for.
He would
probably kill
me to hear
that I was
turning his
flu into
his death.
But it
came up.
And I
think it
is really
important that
we look at
it.
It's
critical for
those of
us who
have already
become
seniors
because one
of the
things he's
doing with
us is
pushing us
to become
more and
more independent
of him.
And he's
making us
face a
sangha
who expects
him, you
know.
You want
Dido, you
know.
We know
that.
And to
be here
anyway and
to trust
our own
experience is
our challenge.
But for
all the
sangha that's
happening in
the next
ten years,
twenty years,
they're going
to be
particularly
about that.
And what
it does is
really challenge
how we
practice in
a kind
of beautiful
way.
I mean,
there's a
sense in
which I'm
really glad
that my
teacher's not
thirty-five
years old.
For many
reasons, but
for one
reason, because
there is that
time whip
there.
And how much
longer will he
be teaching?
How many more
talks will
there be?
How many more
chances for
interview will
there be?
How many more
sessions?
sessions with
Daito
Sensei?
And when we
look at that,
it kind of
alters how
you see your
own practice.
I mean, I
thought of what
we see as
Daito's
life.
Daito gets
up every day
at 4.30,
every week,
and teaches.
He comes
and does
Zazen
every morning.
He does a
liturgy
practice.
He's created
eight areas
of training.
And every
week, it's
going on,
all year.
Every Sunday,
there's a
talk.
Every month,
there's a
session.
Twelve,
fifteen times
a year,
there's
Fusatsu.
There are
innumerable
mandos.
There's
Dharma
combat.
There are
retreats,
week-long
retreats.
There's a
tractor that
he uses to
teach with.
There's a
journal that
he uses to
teach with.
There's a
kitchen that
he uses to
teach with.
There's a
home that
each of you
who are
non-residents
that he
uses to
teach with.
But do
we use it?
I looked at
it as someone
called a
senior.
How readily
do I go
for the
opportunities
that he
gives me
that this
teaching
presents to
me?
Am I
hungry for
it?
Or do I
say, I
don't really
want to do
that.
That's really
hard.
Am I
realizing that
this might
be one of
only five
more chances
to do
this?
To have
that mirror
there?
He gave
the talk
yesterday and
I went
in livid
over a
line that I
didn't understand
in the poem
and why
did the
guy have
to keep
throwing up
for three
years?
That seemed
really stupid
and in my
own poem
there was
this line
about a
seal on
somebody's
elbow and
what did
that mean
and why
is the
language so
screwy?
I said
something like
I just
want to box
my ears.
I don't want
to hear
anything else
I don't
understand
for a
while.
And he
said,
do you
ask me,
I had just
given this
talk about
asking,
do you
ask me about
all the
questions you've
got,
about every
line in
the poem,
about every
line in the
talk,
in everything
that you hear,
do you deal
with it?
He says,
I still call
my teacher
3,000 miles
away when I'm
working with
the koan that
I have a question
about.
It's
incredible.
For
residents,
we see it
in our lives
all the time
and we're
right in the
midst of
just like
everybody is
this week,
this dawn
to late
night
opportunity
just
steaming,
just coming
at us from
all sides
with just
such energy
and yet
what do we
do with it?
You know,
how many
services
in a week
of training
do people
chant like
they do
in the middle
of a session?
Is this
what a
chance this
is?
What is
this chant?
What is
this sound?
Who am
I?
That total
asking.
I asked
Daitoshi
yesterday,
I told the
story of
Yisun and
Kyogen the
day before
and presented
it totally
differently.
The way I
had heard
it was
that when
Kyogen left
Isan full
of great
doubt,
he didn't
let go of
the question
at all.
It totally
penetrated
him.
Moment
after moment
he couldn't
get away
from it
and that
was why
when the
pebble
struck the
bamboo
he woke
up.
You said
he let
it go
completely
and that
was why
when the
pebble
struck
bamboo
he woke
up
which is
right
and he
gave me
this kind
of like
which is
right
you know
and said
you know
what do you
think
asking
completely
is?
What do
you think
letting go
completely
is?
When you
ask
completely
and it
penetrates
every cell
in your
being
it penetrates
your karma
it's there
moment
after moment
you don't
have to
hold on
to it
it's there
it's how
you lift
your hand
brush the
hair out
of your
eyes
blink
your eyes
that's it
that's
letting go
you're not
holding on
to anything
anymore
that's when
the pebble
strikes
bamboo
Sangston
ends his
poem
with a
beautiful
bunch of
lines
that I'll
read
and end
with
but before
I do
that I
wanted to
encourage
all of
us to
look at
what we're
expecting
look at
what we're
expecting
from this
day
from
Dido
from each
other
from our
lives
you know
it's
such a
subtle
thing
and it
takes
such
a fine
determination
to work
with it
there's a
very deep
sitting
happening
today
in this
endo
I don't
think I've
ever felt
it quite
so strong
there's a
definite
possibility
for anything
to happen
to not
expect
but to
do
completely
is how
a body
heals
if you've
ever done
any healing
visualization
that's one
of the first
things you
work with
is to do
it with
complete
commitment
with no
expectation
of any
set result
you just
do it
you just
trust
the doing
it
the most
powerful
thing I
could probably
do is
shut up
which I'll
do very
shortly
because we've
each got
exactly what
our teacher's
been telling
us we've
got for
years
the power
to do
what we
need to
do
everything
we need
to do
what we
need to
do
he doesn't
expect to
give us
anything
I don't
expect to
have anything
to teach
or give
any of the
people I'm
sitting with
except my
own practice
because that's
what I received
and that's
what I receive
every moment
we sit
together
I hope
and I
commit
the rest
of this
day
the rest
of this
session
to the
kind of
practice
that
Daito
Sensei
this Dharma
and this
Sangha
is all
about
that's my
vow
one thing
all things
move among
and intermingle
without
distinction
to live
in this
realization
is to
be without
anxiety
about
non-perfection
to live
in this
faith
is the
road
to
non-duality
because
the
non-dual
is one
with the
trusting
mind
words
the way
is beyond
language
for in it
there is
no yesterday
no tomorrow
and no
today
