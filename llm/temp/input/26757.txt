I didn't prepare anything specifically for this evening.
I started on a number of occasions over the last couple of days, putting together something
that I would say during this jukai ceremony, and then reflecting on it the next day, I
decided, no, it doesn't feel right.
And so it went right up until this evening.
And so I'd like to just ramble a bit about the precepts.
The precepts to me are like a great jewel.
It's one of the most important things I discovered in the practice of Buddhism.
And as my training progressed, the precepts became clearer and clearer.
And then finally, the last part of training, the 120 koans on the precepts, really brought
it all into very, very sharp focus and confirmed for me what my suspicions had been all along.
And that is that these 16 precepts, when they're understood completely, are one of the most
profound moral and ethical teachings available anywhere in the history of humankind.
And for those of you that don't know, this is our lotus flower sangha at Greenhaven prison.
And most of the students that are members of that sangha are in prison for life.
It's a maximum security prison.
And most in our sangha, most in the prison, are there for murder, one of the different
kinds of counts of murder.
And so they're there for having taken human life.
And I've mentioned many times before that it's probably the strongest affiliate group that
we have, that probably is, it's definitely the strongest affiliate group that we have.
And most of the men that are in that sangha are not educated.
The few that are educated receive their education in prison.
There are several that receive bachelor's degrees and, I believe, master's degrees while incarcerated.
Master high school dropouts.
And the letter I received the other day was, many of them, I guess maybe 15 of them, have
received the precepts.
Each Rohatsu I give the precepts to those people who meet the requirements for the precepts, which
is basically the same as they are here.
And so there are a group of them, about 15, who have received the precepts.
And the letter included a copy of Kyojukaimon.
Kyojukaimon is a document produced by Dogen Zenji.
And it's usually passed on during the… it's one of the documents that's passed on during
a transmission of the precepts at the end of training, along with the blood lineage and
a lot of other things.
And basically it's a statement by Dogen of his understanding of the precepts.
And as far as I know, it's published in English in only one place.
And that is in Kenneth Roshi's Zen is Eternal Life.
It's one of several documents that she's published that generally is not published, but she did.
They found it, they found it, they've been reading it, they've been studying it,
they've got a lot of questions on it, they've written to ask me if I would produce a similar
document in language that they might understand a little better.
So that they, each one of them, can tack it on the wall of their cell, and each morning,
as part of their morning routine, which is body practice, zazen, service, individual
service in each cell, they each do their own service.
They want to add this to it, a renewal of vows using the Kyoju Kaimono.
And it's kind of interesting to me how, I guess I've given the precepts to at least close
to 100 people outside of the prison, and probably a good percentage of them, a third or more,
are people with doctorates, master's degrees, what we would consider in this country very
well educated.
And the kind of questions, first of all, it's rare that I get questions on the precepts.
And when I do, the questions are usually practical questions, you know, what do you do if such
and such, and such and such.
Rarely is there any evidence in the questions that people have really penetrated, started to
study the precepts, examined them, tested them, evaluated them, brought the awareness of
the precept into life situations, and came up against difficulties.
It happens once in a while, but it's very rare, considering the number of people practicing,
and considering the number of people in the prison.
We're coming to our last three weeks of this ango.
In fact, it's probably not even three weeks, it's more like two weeks, because at the end of the next session,
which is two weeks away, is Shisohosen.
Shisohosen, that's the end of ango.
And ango is a time for intensive study, intensive practice.
Intensive practice includes all aspects of our practice, not just Shisohosen, but all of it.
Liturgy, body practice, study, precepts, Shisohosen, face-to-face teaching.
The guys in prison live kind of like monks, in a way.
When I first started working with them seven years ago, I told them that, like it or not,
they were living the life of a monk, a life of poverty, chastity, and obedience.
And that, rather than resist that, since it's an imposed discipline, to make it their own.
To take a vow of poverty, of chastity, and of obedience, and to practice it.
And the strongest among them have done that.
They practice every single day.
They don't have Hosan.
And in addition to the daily practice that each one of them does every morning and every evening in their cell,
they're now doing a one-day session each month that was approved.
The Rahatsu session each year, which is two days.
And every Wednesday there's sitting in the afternoon, in the morning, in liturgy.
And every Monday is sitting as a sangha and study and training.
They look at a video, they study together, and so on.
They get very little dokes on, maybe once or twice a year, at best.
They get very little support from outside the walls, once a week, sometimes.
Sometimes they go months with no one being there.
But they have found a very important thing, and I had mentioned that to them also at the beginning.
And that is that in prison, all the good stuff is outside the walls.
It all comes in through the gate.
Whatever is good, whatever is important.
And I said, this is one thing that you're going to find, the Dharma, that doesn't come from the outside.
It comes from right in here.
You will create it.
And indeed, that's what they're doing.
I mentioned a story to encourage you not to be passive with the precepts, to take them seriously.
There's a hidden teaching there.
There's a lot to it.
There's a lot to it that will unfold as your practice unfolds.
And if you go all the way to the end, you will cover things that are almost unimaginable at this point.
And normally, those things are not taught until you reach that point in your training.
And the reason is, is that people are usually not ready for it.
But if you're already ready, I don't care whether you're a six-month practitioner or a 15-year practitioner,
if you ask the question, you will get the answer.
Just like every other aspect of practice and training, it's in your hands.
These precepts have been handed down through the ages, mind to mind.
Oh, not the 17 precepts or the 250 precepts, but what the precepts, what the spirit of the precepts is about.
They've been transmitted mind to mind, generation to generation.
The original precepts numbered somewhere about 250.
And to this day, the monks of the Vinaya monks, monks of the Vipassana, Theravadan monks,
monks of some of the Chinese lineages, still take these 250 precepts.
And there are even more that nuns take.
And somewhere around the fifth century, these became the 16 precepts,
with the emergence of Mahayana Buddhism.
And the early history of it is kind of sketchy.
Although we have Bodhidharma's comments called the One Mind Precepts.
Whether or not Bodhidharma really commented on them in that way is another story,
but it's attributed to Bodhidharma.
The sixth patriarch, Eno, in the Platform Sutra, those of you that have read the Platform Sutra,
and keep in mind that the Platform Sutra and the Diamond Sutra are two
books that are part of the reading for people in the second stage of practice.
It's absolutely indispensable to really appreciating what's going on in the second stage of practice.
Very few people read it. I know very few people read it.
I can tell my conversations with them that they haven't read it.
But at least 15 koans in the koan system come right out of the Diamond Sutra.
Well, Diamond Sutra and Platform Sutra, in the Platform Sutra,
Wei Neng, or Eno, gave the precepts to a group of lay practitioners.
And that's the first documented evidence of the precepts being actively used with lay practitioners that I'm aware of.
Later, as monasteries began to develop, Zen monasteries began to develop,
a set of rules of conduct in addition to the precepts that were to guide the life and
practice of the monks or the community.
These were lost in antiquity. A very small part of it survives,
and they can be found in the newly published Transmission of the Lamp,
which is a compilation of the koans and teachings of some 1700 masters.
There are a few of Yakujo's rules that survived there. But then,
Dogen Zenji, when he set up
Eheji,
he wanted to create a Japanese monastic form.
He wanted the Dharma to be Japanese, not Chinese. And so, he actually created the first authentic
Japanese Zen monastery. All the monasteries before that were kind of mishmashes of
Tendai, and Pure Land, and Shingon, and Zen, and all kinds of mixtures. But what he did is he
He made it particularly a Zen monastery and used a Japanese form and created what's called the
Shingi. Shingi. Shingi are the rules of conduct for a monk, for a monastic code.
Now, monastic codes have existed
always with monasticism. The Benedictine code is the one that governs most of the Christian monasteries,
and then there are others also in Christian monasteries.
There are similar codes in Sufism and other religions.
And basically, what the monastic codes are about is
the peace and harmony of a community.
The rules of conduct, of relationship, of responsibility,
that create an atmosphere of peace and harmony for a community of practitioners.
We, several years ago, produced a Shingi for Doshinji. It's called the Doshinji Code.
The monastic code of Zen Mountain Monastery. It hangs on the wall downstairs, and
everybody that comes into training
says that they've read and understood and take full responsibility for observing those rules.
It's amazing how few people are aware of them, and what they say.
The bottom line, the last of the some 17, 18, maybe 20 items in the Doshinji Code, the very last,
is that the precepts govern the conduct, or guide to the conduct of people here in the monastery,
whether people have received the precepts or not. That's part of the code, and everyone that comes into
residency, or trains here, accepts by virtue of petitioning the guardian council, those rules. Every
student accepts, excuse me, accepts that.
Those precepts, the Fusatsu ceremony, the Doshinji Code, the six paramitas,
are a treasure house of moral and ethical teachings, unlike anything that we've experienced here in the West.
Actually, unlike anything that's been experienced in the East. They're pretty unique. They're unique in
one sense to Buddhism, but even more so, their uniqueness exists in Zen, for the simple reason
that it's one thing to look at those 16 precepts as a set of rules, but they're much, much more than that.
Because part of the understanding that comes from this practice of Zen
Zen is the mutual identity of phenomena and the Absolute, is the interdependence of all things,
is the interpenetration of all things.
Now, it's one thing to see that in terms of the Absolute and the Relative.
And it's wonderful.
It's very expansive, the way one begins to understand what they're saying in the Heart Sutra,
form is emptiness, emptiness is form, form is exactly emptiness, emptiness exactly form.
But Absolute and Relative are just two of the 10,000 dualities that govern human existence.
There's also the dualities of good and evil,
people of sacred and secular, of sacred and secular, of maleness and femaleness,
of monk practice and lay practice, of monastery and in the world.
Those dualities, all of them, can be examined, appreciated and understood
from the point of view of the teachings of mutual identity, interpenetration,
co-dependency, mutual arising, co-origination,
co-origination, most importantly, the precepts, when they're understood
from the point of view of the five ranks of Master Tozan,
become alive, vibrant with life.
They're no longer a set of rules imposed from the outside,
but a manifestation of one's own
existence, one's own understanding.
We live in a time
of real, deep,
moral decay.
And if you look,
really look,
go to your libraries,
go to the religions,
go to the philosophers,
ask
for guidelines, for moral and ethical guidelines,
and see what you come up with.
And probably the strongest, most powerful,
ethical guidelines
are the product of legislation in the courts,
not the religions.
and see what you come up with.
Something wrong there,
something sadly wrong there.
And each one of us
that practices this Dharma
has access to one of the most profound moral and ethical teachings ever to emerge from humankind.
And most of us are satisfied to just barely scratch the surface because that's all I do in the precept ceremony.
The precepts ceremony is initiation.
It's a beginning.
I spend most of my time
I'm wetting your appetite.
I spend most of my time
trying to tantalize you
with the possibilities.
And then you
put a rock suit around your neck,
tuck the blood lineage
into your filing cabinet
and go merrily on your way.
The penetrating, continuous practice of the buddhas and ancestors.
If that had been the practice,
this Dharma would have been extinguished a long time ago.
It gets its life
from those precepts.
Unfortunately, we come to the precepts and the paramitas
out of the context of Western religions.
This seems like just another set of rules.
So we had the Ten Commandments yesterday,
today we have the 16 precepts.
Not so.
Very different.
And they address all of the things
that are the cause of great moral strife
and great moral sickness
that exists in the 20th century.
And I might say that it's not just
this Sangha.
In fact, this Sangha might be one of the better Sanghas with regard to that.
But in general,
the Buddha Dharma in America
has addressed a lot of things.
But they haven't addressed basic moral and ethical issues.
What we do is a lot of applied morality.
And that's good.
But there's more going on.
Much, much more.
Our applied morality doesn't differ very much
from the applied morality of Christianity or Judaism.
We have something that they don't have to offer.
But you need to understand it
before you can manifest it.
It's not so simple as do this and don't do that.
It's much, much more complex because life is much, much more complex than that.
We have all of these images of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.
And we tend to take up
someone like Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva
as the object
of veneration.
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva is not to be dealt with objectively.
It's to be dealt with subjectively.
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva is this body and mind
and the body and mind of all sentient beings.
When we chant
Nammu Shakyamuni Buddha
Nammu Samantabhadra Bodhisattva
Nammu Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva
Nammu
is being one with
being one with
is totally subjective.
It's not a prayer.
It's not a petition.
Shakyamuni Buddha is not the object.
It's the subject.
Avalokiteshvara is the subject.
This whole incredible Dharma
is the subject,
not the object.
Our practice
is one hundred percent subjective.
I am
the Buddha.
I am
the Dharma.
I am
the Sangha.
I am the Buddha.
It's a very, very personal matter.
Don't be so objective with it.
Be intimate with it.
Make it your own.
It's your life.
You've made it such
by taking those vows.
You make it such
each evening
when you renew
the Bodhisattva vows.
Consider
these teachings.
Consider them
one of the most important things
you'll ever encounter in your life.
Find out about it.
Let it reveal itself.
