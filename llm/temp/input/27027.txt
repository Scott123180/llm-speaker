The Transmission of the Light
Case 49
The 49th Ancestor
Setsho Chikan Dayosho
When Sogaku was abbot at Tendo, one day he went up in the hall and quoted,
The Buddha had a secret saying, Kaya Shapa didn't conceal it.
The master hearing this suddenly realized the mystic meaning.
He wept as he stood in his place, unconsciously blurting out,
Why haven't we heard this before?
After his lecture, Sogaku summoned the master and asked him,
Why were you weeping in the teaching hall?
The master said, The Buddha had a secret saying, but Kaya Shapa didn't conceal it.
Sogaku gave him approval and said, You must be the one Ungo predicted long ago.
So, I've added a pointer to this koan.
Without discriminating east from west, nor north from south,
From morning till evening, from evening till morning,
Is this a person that's asleep?
Sometimes manifesting eyes like comets,
Can it be said that this is awake?
Sometimes this person points north and calls it south.
Is this mindful or mindless?
Is this a person of the way or is it an ordinary person?
If you can see into this, you will know the ancient secret that is not concealed.
You will realize personally the mystic meaning itself.
That's the Kaizan's verse.
We could call it the indestructible, eminent body.
That body is empty.
It's clear and luminous.
Sometimes it's easy to forget
That these names that we chant
Are real, live, flesh and blood people
Like you and me.
They laugh.
They cry.
They get hungry and tired.
They get horny or happy or sad.
In a word, in a word, very much human.
Extraordinarily human.
Extraordinary because they've realized
And they've actualized
That which is the potential
Of everyone
Born of the human form.
The list that we chant
Is the process
That brings us
Brings it to us
On this mountain
This day
And in a sense
The whole thing
All of it
Happened
Just for you
Not the one sitting next to you
But for you
That's all
Just you
It's difficult
Not to be grateful
For this incredible Dharma
This incredible life
It's by you
That I can see
These great ancestors
We're in the last hours
Of our session
And indeed
It's been a very powerful one
In the last 24 hours
Two people have broken through
Their first koan
Several have
Really turned around
Some key life barriers
And just about every
Man Jack
And woman Jane
Of you
Has reached a new level
In your practice
It's indeed been
Impressively strong
We should do
A
A
Daisei
Shin
Every month
But I can't take it
I'm getting
I'm getting too fragile
For it
In the pointer
I've tried to
Bring up
Some of the things
To look for
In this koan
Without discriminating
East from west
Nor north from south
From morning till evening
From evening till morning
Without discriminating
Is this someone
That's asleep
That they're describing
Sometimes manifesting
Eyes like comets
Is this somebody
That's awake
Sometimes this person
Points north
And calls it south
Is this mindfulness
Or mindlessness
Is this a person
Of the way
Or is it just
An ordinary being
I'm lost without it
Thank you
If you can see
Into this
You will know
The ancient secret
That's not concealed
You'll realize
Personally
The mystic meaning
Itself
This sogaku
Was
Tendo sogaku
This
You may recall
If I
This was right before
Secho was actually
The teacher
Secho
Chikan
Dayosho
Was the teacher
Of Tendo Nyojo
And Tendo Nyojo
Is
Is
Dogen Zenji's teacher
So this was right before
Dogen
Got to China
And succeeded
Tendo Nyojo
And then brought
The teachings
Back to Japan
So Tendo
So Tendo
Tendo Sogaku
Obviously
Was the
The abbot
Of Tendo
Monastery
The same monastery
That Dogen went to
Finally when he went to China
And if you remember
Dogen
Was
Kind of picky
It seems that
When he got there
He
It took a lot
To satisfy
Dogen
You know
He
He wasn't satisfied
With
The
Kendai school
That's where he was ordained
And that's where he studied
And then he came to
Isai
Who was the
Rinzai monk
That brought
Zen to Japan
And he studied
At Isai's monastery
And succeeded
That lineage
With
Mionin
Mionin
Miozin
Right
He succeeded
Miozin
With the Rinzai lineage
And then
He and
Miozin
Went
To China
He still wasn't satisfied
With what had happened
So he went to China
And when he got to China
What he saw
He was very disappointed with
And of course
That period of time
In China
There was a decline
Of Buddhism
During the Song dynasty
And
There was a lot of corruption
That was going on
The usual things
That will happen
In any religion
You know
The priests
Get into power
Position
Authority
Fancy robes
Big monasteries
And so on
It's a very human disease
And it crops up
In all sorts of places
Nobody
There's no
Immune system
Yet
Developed for it
And Dogen
Wasn't happy
With what he saw
Until finally
He met the cook
From Tendo's monastery
And in his dialogue
With the cook
He realized
That this cook
Was a real
Person of the way
And so he went
To Tendo's monastery
And began studying
With Tendo
Tendo evidently
Tendo Nyojo
Evidently
Recognized him
Immediately
Because he gave him
Total access
To him
Anytime
Day or night
He said
Come
Talk to me
If you
If you need to
And Dogen studied
With him
And succeeded him
And came back
To Japan
And created
Kind of a
Authentic
Monastic style
Along the lines
Of the way
It was in China
Well this is
Right before
All of that
Happened
And Sugaku
Was the
Abbot there
And Tendo Nyojo's
Teacher
Was still
Unrealized
And incidentally
What this is
That I'm
For those of you
That are not familiar
With
The Record
Of the Transmission
Of the Light
Is a series
Of koans
I think
52
53
Koans
That record
The enlightenment
Experiences
Beginning with
Shakyamuni Buddha
Through the
Success of
Generations
Up to
Kezan
Who was the
Compiler of this
His teacher
And
It's part
Of our
Regular
Koan
Study
Here
So each
Of these
Each of these
Enlightenment
Experiences
Becomes a
Koan
To be seen
By the
Student
So that the
Student can
Make this
Their own
Experience
Not something
That they
Read
Or some
Historical
Fact
But actually
An intimate
Experience
Of their
Own
So it
Follows
It's
Toward the
End of
Koan
Study
It follows
Passing
Through that
First
Barrier
200 koans
Miscellaneous
Koans
The koans
Of the
Gateless
Gate
Mumungkan
The koans
Of the
Bluecliff
Record
The koans
Of the
Book of
Equanimity
That we've
Been doing
This week
And then
We do
These koans
And then
That's
Followed by
The five
Ranks
Of Master
Tozan
And finally
The very
Last part
Of our
Study
Is the
Koans
On the
Precept
Over a
Hundred
Koans
On the
Precepts
Now the
Precepts
Are something
That
Student takes
At the
Very
Beginning
Of their
Training
And at
That point
It's an
Act of
Faith
Taking
Those
Precepts
You don't
Know from
Your own
Experience
Yet
That
These
Precepts
Are indeed
The life
Of the
Buddha
You take
It on
Faith
And you
Take those
Precepts
And practice
Those
Precepts
As a way
Of manifesting
In your
Own life
The life
Of the
Buddha
But before
Your training
Is over
Before your
Formal
Training
Is over
Those
Precepts
Are to
Be
A
Manifestation
Of your
Own life
And part
Of making
It that
Of bringing
That to
Full
Realization
Are these
Hundred
Or so
Koans
That are
The very
Very last
Thing
That are
Completed
Before
The
Transmission
Begins
This thing
That we're
Describing
Here
This
Light
That's
Being
Transmitted
From
Generation
To
Generation
In a
Sense
It's
Difficult
To hide
When it's
There it's
Easy to
See
I mean
It's
Very easy
To see
When one
Of you
Is very
Close
To seeing
It
Or when
You've
Seen
It
I remember
Being a
Monitor
ZCLA
Knowing
When I
See somebody
Come out
Of the
Doksan
Room
If they've
Seen it
You know
If they've
Passed through
That first
Barrier
I mean
It shows
It really
Shows
It's hard
To conceal
It
You know
All know
The story
Of the
I forget
His name
But I
Call him
Melon
Roshi
This
Roshi
This
Soul
Master
That
When he
Succeeded
His teacher
He
Went off
To mature
His practice
And
Instead of
Doing the
Usual
Thing
Going off
Into the
Mountains
And living
As a
Hermit
He
Went
And hung
Out
With the
Beggars
Living under
The bridges
And
Became
Became a
Beggar
Like a
Hobo
It was the
Hobo
Roshi
And
They found
Out
The
Emperor
One of
The
Heavy
People
In the
Administration
Of the
Country
Wanted to
Make him
A national
Teacher
I think
And they
Couldn't
Find him
Because he
Was you
Know he
Disappeared
Into the
Woodwork
So they
Devised all
Kinds of
Tricks in
Order to
Find him
Find out
Where he
Was
So finally
They
Talked to
Another zen
Master
And they
Said you
Know what
Can you
Tell us
That will
Help us
Find him
And he
Said well
I heard
He really
Loves melons
So I
Suggest that
What you
Do is
You get
Your soldiers
To go
And we
Know he's
Hanging out
With the
Beggars
Somewhere
But there
Are hundreds
Of bridges
And hundreds
Of beggars
And you'll
Never recognize
Them you
Know
But if
You go
To each
Of these
Bridges
And offer
Free melons
To all
Of the
Beggars
When they
Come forward
Have the
Soldier
Ask them
Before he
Gives them
The melon
With
Take this
Melon
Without using
Your hands
And
Surely
The real
Master
Will be
Will reveal
Himself
It will be
Difficult for
Him to
Conceal it
So the
Soldiers
Did that
They would
Say
Free melons
All the
Beggars
Would come
And they
Would say
As they
Reached out
For the
Melon
The soldier
Would say
Take it
Without using
Your hands
And the
Beggar
Would look
At him
Like you
Know
Have you
Lost your
Mind
And then
They'd give
Him the
Melon
You know
And the
Next one
Would come
Up
Finally
The old
Master
Came up
And the
Soldier
Said
Take it
Without using
Your hands
He said
Give it
To me
Without using
Your hands
And they
Got him
They brought
Him back
And made him
A national
Teacher
So it's
Hard to
Conceal
But it's
True of
Delusion as
Well
Isn't
Hard to
Conceal
Our
Arrogance
Self
Centeredness
Separation
Greed
Anger
Ignorance
And that
Comes
When we
Take this
Personal
Bubble
That we
Call the
Skin
Bag
As being
The whole
Thing
We lock
Ourselves
Inside it
And separate
Ourselves
From
Everything
Else
And that's
Where all
The pain
And misfortune
Arises
From
So
Sugaku
Was the
Abbot
At Tendo
And one
Day went
Up to the
Hall
And quoted
The Buddha
Buddha had
Had a secret
Saying
Or secret
Teaching
Kaisapa
Kaisapa
Didn't
Didn't conceal
It
Didn't conceal it
He didn't
Hide it
Kaisapa
Was the
Buddhist
Successor
The master
Hearing this
The master
Is the
Disciple
In this
Point
The patriarch
Or the
Ancestor
Is the
Teacher
The master
Hearing this
Suddenly
Realized
The mystic
Meaning
He wept
As he
Stood in
This place
Unconsciously
Blurting
Out
Now there
Are a
Couple of
Translations
Of this
I like
Ours
Better
Than
Cleary's
It's
More sentimental
Says when
The
48th
Patriarch
Sogaku
Zenji
Was master
Of the
Monastery
At
Mount
Tendo
He ascended
The rastrum
One day
And announced
The world
Honored
One
Has secret
Words
But Kaisapa
Does not
Keep them
Covered
Up
The master
Hearing
This
Suddenly
Realized
The subtle
Significance
And standing
With the
Other disciples
His eyes
Flowing
With tears
Involuntarily
Said
Why didn't
I realize
That before
After
Finishing
His talk
The patriarch
Called the
Master
To him
And asked
Why were
You weeping
In the
Dharma
Hall
The master
Said
The world
Honored
One
Had secret
Words
But
Kaisapa
Does not
Keep them
Covered
Up
And the
Patriarch
Acknowledging
Him
Said
That's
None
Other than
Ungo's
Prediction
Now this
Quote
Is from
The Nirvana
Sutra
In the
Nirvana
Sutra
It says
At that
Time
Kaisapa
Bodhisattva
Said to the
Buddha
According
According to
What the
Buddha
Says
The
Buddhas
Have
Secret
Sayings
But
This
Is
Not
True
Why
Because
The
Buddhas
Only
Have
Esoteric
Sayings
But
They
Don't
Have
A
Secret
Canon
Take
For
Example
The
Case
Of
Magician
Robot
Though
People
See
It
Move
They
Don't
See
What's
Inside
That
Makes
It
Move
Buddha's
Teaching
Is
Different
It
Lets
Everybody
See
And
Know
All
How
Can
It
Be
Said
That
The
Buddhas
Have
A
Secret
Canon
The
Buddha
Praised
Kaisapa
Very
Good
As
You
Say
The
Buddha
Has
No
Secret
Canon
Why
Like
The
Full
Moon
Appearing
In
The
Autumn
Sky
Clear
And
Unobscured
Which
Everyone
Can
See
So
Are
The
Words
Of
The
Buddha
They
Are
Open
And
Clear
Pure
And
Without
Obscurity
Ignorant
People
Don't
Understand
And
Say
It's
A
Secret
Store
The
Wise
Understand
And
Don't
Call
It
A
Store
And
Of
Course
That's
True
You
Know
It
Can
Appear
Like
A
Secret
When
You
Haven't
Realized
It
Once
Having
Realized
It
Becomes
So
Obvious
And
You
Wonder
Why
It
Took
So
Long
And
I
Mentioned
Before
Many
Times
How
After
Passing
That
First
Koan
Mu
I
I
I
Was
Appalled
To
Hear
The
Teacher
Telling
Everybody
What
It
Was
All
The
Time
And
I
Would
Hear
The
Monitors
Yelling
Out
Telling
Everybody
What
It
Was
And
I
Was
Always
Afraid
That
You
Know
I
Would
Hear
The
Monitor
Yell
Out
Tell
Everybody
What
Mu
Is
And
I
Figured
Any
Minute
Everybody
Is
Going
To
Jump
Up
And
Run
To
Doxon
You
Know
They
Must
All
See
It
But
You
Can
Hear
It
Something
Happens
And
Then
You
Hear
It
I
I
I
I've
Used
The
Example
Of
You
Know
Giving
Sex
Education
To
A
Three
Year
Old
Four
Year
Old
They
Can't
Hear
It
You
Know
They
Say
Daddy
Where
The
Babies
Come
From
I
Mean
All
They
Want
Is
Mommy
Mommy
Is
Where
They
Came
From
That's
All
From
The
Mother
But
If
You
Sit
Down
And
Give
Werm
And
Ovum
Copulation
And
All
Of
This
Doesn't
Mean
Anything
To
A
Four
Year
Old
They
Can't
Even
Hear
It
Ten
Years
Later
Hoo
Hoo
I
Mean
All
Of
That
Is
Incredibly
Significant
Now
Body
And
Mind
Are
Ready
So
How
Do
We
Make
Body
And
Mind
Ready
That's
What
Our
Practice
Is
About
Is
What
Our
Session
Is
About
The
Realization
Is
A
Realization
Of
Something
That's
Already
There
So
It's
Not
Coming
To
You
Not
Being
Received
There's
No
Gain
There's
No
Loss
But
Unless
We're
Prepared
And
That
Preparation
Is
Kind
Of
Interesting
You
Know
We
Say
It
Only
Takes
A
Minute
To
Realize
It
Just
Like
That
That's
How
Long
It
Takes
People
Say
Why
Does
It
Take
So
Long
You
Know
It's
Like
Boiling
Water
Only
Like
That
Water
Boils
When
You
Go
From
99.999
Degrees
To
100
Degrees
Centigrade
It's
Only
You
Know
A
Thousand
Of
A
Degree
Difference
In
A
Fraction
Of
A
Second
From
Non
Boiling
To
Boiling
But
It
Took
A
Long
Time
To
Get
It
To
That
Temperature
Before
That
Change
From
Non
Boiling
To
Boiling
Took
Place
And if
It's
A
Big
Pot
With
A
Lot
Of
Stuff
In
It
Takes
Longer
Kezan
Says
Since
That
Time
The
Time
Of
This
Experience
The
Saying
Has
Long
Been
Used
In
The
Zen
Schools
According
To
This
Case
Too
Chikan
Hearing
It
Quoted
Became
Enlightened
Truly
It
Hides
Nothing
When
You
Hear
Words
You
Should
Understand
The
Heart
Of
The
Matter
Don't
Get
Stuck
On
Words
Saying
Fire
Is
Not
Fire
Saying
Water
Is
Not
Water
That's
Why
Your
Mouth
Doesn't
Burn
When
You
Speak
Of
Fire
And
When
You
Speak
Of
Water
Your
Mouth
Doesn't
Get
Wet
That's
Kind
Of
Interesting
Of
Of
Of
Of
We
All
Know
That
Right
That
The
Words
And
Ideas
That
Describe
Reality
Is
Not
The
Reality
A
Word
Is
An
Abstraction
Of
The
Reality
Everybody
Knows
That
You
Figure
That
Out
Very
Early
In
Life
You
Start
Off
With
A
Definite
Reality
Say
For
Example
Your
Relationship
With
Your
Mother
Which
Is
Usually
A
Person's
First
Strong
Awareness
And
Relationship
So
Mother
At
That
Point
In
Time
Is
Is
A
Series
Of
Tactile
Responses
Mother
Is
Smell
Mother
Is
The
Taste
Of
Milk
Mother
Is
Warm
Mother
Is
A
Cooing
Voice
There's
A
Caress
There's
A
Touch
It's
A
Physical
Experience
But
Before
Long
Mother
Becomes
M-O-T-H-E-R
An
Abstraction
Of
That
Reality
And
We
Know
It's
An
Abstraction
Of
Reality
I
Mean
Kid
Doesn't
Think
That
The
Word
On
A
Blackboard
Mother
Is
Their
Mother
We
Know
Yet
We
Proceed
As
If
It
Were
We
Sometimes
Get
Confused
With
The
Abstraction
And
The
Reality
My
Favorite
Example
Is
The
Word
Shout
Which
Is
An
Abstraction
Of
A
Reality
Is
The
Reality
And
There's
No
Mistaking
It
It
Communicates
Immediately
It
Doesn't
Need
A
Translator
Works
In
All
The
Languages
Very
Different
Than
The
Word
Shout
The
Direct
Experience
Itself
Master
Sikita
Once
Said
When
You
Hear
Words
You
Should
Understand
The
Source
Don't
Set
Up
Rules
On
Your
Own
Also
Yakuza
Said
You
Should
See
For
Yourself
Don't
Eliminate
Words
Kezan
Says
Originally
What is
It
Originally
That
Has
No
Ears
No
Eyes
No
Body
No
Mind
Oman
Said
On
The
Other
Hand
If
The
Matter
Were
In
Words
Well
Don't
Dechanical
Teachings
Contain
Words
Why
Should
We
Speak
Of
A
Special
Transmission
Outside
The
Sutras
If
You
Go
By
Learned
Understanding
And
Intellectual
Knowledge
Even
The
Sages
Of
The
Tenth
Stage
Though
They
Can
Expound
The
Teaching
Like
Rain
Giving
Clouds
Still
Are
Criticized
Because
Their
Perception
Of
The
Truth
Is
Still
Like
Looking
Through
Gauze
And
And
Khaizan
Zenji
We
We
Tend
To
Think
Of
Soto
School
Teachers
As
Not
Doing
Koans
And
Sitting
Like
Tree
Stumps
To
To
And
Silent
Illumination
And
Not
Having
An
Active
Edge
Well
Listen
To
Khaizan
Zenji
He
Says
Therefore
People
You
Should
Know
That
There
Is
Something
Which
Is
Not
Only
Speechless
But
Doesn't
Even
Have
A
Mouse
Indeed
it not only has no mouth
there are no eyes either
no physical elements
no sense faculties
fundamentally there's not so much as a hair
and yet
though it is so
this is not a void
it is not nothingness
it means that you see things
and hear sounds
it is not these eyes seeing
not these ears hearing
this is the way the faceless one is
your coming into being as a body
mind
is the doing of this faceless one
in other words yourself
therefore this body and mind
is not something created
if you haven't reached here
you think it's the body
arising from the relation
of your father and mother
or that it's the body born
of the results of actions
therefore you think it's the body
that comes from sperm and ovum
that it's the body covered with skin and flesh
this is all because you don't understand yourself
what is the self?
is it really that bag of skin
that you identify with?
and he says
therefore in order to let people know this realm
teachers use unlimited expedient methods
to cause the senses to stop
making everything cease
and at this point
there's something which cannot be obliterated
there's something which cannot be destroyed
when you get to know this
it's not emptiness
nor is it existence
it's not light
nor is it dark
it's even hard to stay
that one is deluded or enlightened
so we can't even call it Buddhahood
or the realm of realization of Buddhahood
we can't call it the truth
you can't even call it mind or nature
it's just bright
clear
light
so we call it
light
we can't call it the light
of fire or water
because it has no relationship to them
it's just empty
clear
and bright
and it's that
that's transmitted
generation to generation
transmitted
is even a word
that's not right
because transmission
implies
the movement
of something
from A to B
and that's not what happens
you don't receive anything
nothing is given
can't be given
can't be given
why?
because you already have it
it's already your life
so it only can be realized
we call it transmission to
communicate
but that light
is not the light
of a handful
of people
of just these
86 ancestors
that have preceded us
it's the life
of all
beings
therefore if we try to
look into it
we can't see it
and though we try to grasp it
it really can't be grasped
when the world
is destroyed
when the universe
is destroyed
when the great
culp of fire
consumes everything
this thing
this it
cannot be destroyed
what kind of marvelous
incredible
thing is this
it's not
it's not
concealed
it's not hidden
and again
when all the different realms
and forms of existence
come into being
and the myriad forms
come
and go
and are clearly
present
and coming
and going
this thing
this it
doesn't change
why?
so even the buddhists
ancestors
can't do a damn thing
about it
Kezan says
Kezan Zinji says
if you
my good people
if you want to reach
this point
for a moment
close your eyes
see where the breath
ends
and this body
ends
and there's no house
to protect you
all function
is unnecessary
and that you're like
the blue sky
with no clouds
the ocean
without waves
then you'll be
somewhat
in accord
with it
in birth
not a single
speck
is added
in death
not the smallest
particle
is lost
what is it
that has
this incredible
quality
it's each
one of us
each
and every
one of us
the problem
is
is we identify
with a bag
of skin
alone
and not
with the whole
catastrophe
past
present
and future
no there's
nothing
you can do
about it
yet there's
the light
some may
realize it
some may
not
but they
realize
they're not
it's there
the light
that we speak
of is not
like the sun
it's not like
the light
of the moon
the whole sky
is moon
so there's
nothing to
illuminate
the whole
universe
is moon
the whole
universe
is sun
so there's
no place
to shine
so there's
no place
to put
this gigantic
body
Kezan Zenji
said
if you
can't
see this
point
you will
not only
be confused
by monks
nuns
men
women
you will
transmigrate
through the
various states
of being
in the worlds
of desire
form
and formlessness
even though
you be a
Buddhist
in form
you'll still
be caught
by the
king
of the
underworld
won't that
be shameful
shame
on you
this incredible
dharma
fills the
universe
there's no
place
it doesn't
reach
how could
you fail
you blink
your eyes
and it's
there
you draw
a breath
and it's
there
it's no
small thing
to be born
human
because with
that birth
is that
potential
to realize
ourselves
and it's
and it's got
nothing to
do
with all
of the
things
that usually
separate us
make things
difficult to
get to
it's not
male and
it's not
female
it's not
spirit or
a ghost
it's not
ordinary or
holy
it's not
ordained or
lay
practitioner
there's no
place that
can contain
it
and when you
try to see
it
your vision
can't embrace
it all
Kazon says
when you
arrive at
this point
though you
may be a
monk
you're not
a monk
though you
may be a
lay practitioner
you're not
a lay
practitioner
you'll not
be confused
or deluded
by your
senses
nor compelled
by perception
and consciousness
and people
take this to
mean that
suddenly there's
no more
feelings
you know
that you're
going to
turn into
a nummy
and that's
why you
people resist
but that's
not true
that's not
what happens
there's a
big difference
you see
we also
think of
non-attachment
means not
caring
that's not
what non-attachment
means
in fact
it's not
possible to
really care
until you
can be
non-attached
it's not
possible to
love
really love
unless you
can do it
without
holding on
because
holding on
an attachment
by definition
requires
two
the
attachee
and the
attachor
when they
merge
there's no
longer
attachment
and it's a
whole different
kind of
loving
and it's a
whole different
kind of
feeling
and it's a
whole different
kind of
loving
living
everything
seems the
same
but the
way you
perceive it
and the
way you
respond to
it
is very
very
very
personal
personal
doesn't reach
it
intimate
intimate
intimate
is
enlightenment
itself
intimate
means
whole
body
and mind
and so
we use
all of
these
methods
that we've
evolved
through the
ages
we use
the sutras
and the
koan
we use
work
practice
where you
study
chanting
and bowing
or
yoke
face-to-face
teaching
dharma
discourse
all of
it
all of
it
is skillful
means
just
to bring
us
to that
place
that we've
always had
that's always
been with
us
it's kind
of crazy
in a way
isn't it
looking for
what you've
got
finding it
and being
overjoyed
finding out
nothing has
changed
and yet
it's so
different
the way
you see
it
so
the old
master
once said
studying the
way is
like
making a
fire
drilling for
fire
you know
we use
the
piece of
wood
with the
shaft
and you
got to
really get
it going
we're
going to
do this
next year
when we
do our
wilderness
trip
it's one
of the
things
making a
fire
from scratch
it takes
a lot
of patience
and a lot
of time
and what
he says
when you're
drilling for
fire
don't stop
when you
see smoke
that's what
we do
look
look
smoke
and then
the whole
thing
cools down
again
you got to
start all
over again
people say
it all the
time
you know
I was
like
right on
the edge
and
and then
you notice
it
oh look
I'm right
on the
edge
and then
you move
back
5,000
miles
and start
all over
again
or you
experience a
little bit
of samadhi
one day
and then
you spend
the rest
of the
session
trying to
recreate it
somehow
you don't
know how
it happened
but you
want it
again
and the
minute you
grab onto
it
reach out
for it
it moves
away
it's like
two magnets
repelling
each other
so when
you see
fire
when you
see smoke
don't stop
when you
use all
your strength
at one
stretch
you get
fire
and then
Kezan asks
what stage
does seeing
smoke
refer to
and he
says
when you
meet the
skillful
technique
of a
teacher
and reach
the stage
where not
a single
thought is
born
this is the
time when
you see
smoke
if you
linger here
and rest
a while
this is like
stopping at
the warmth
you should
go on
to see
the fire
this means
to know
that which
is able
to not
produce a
single
thought
that's you
that's you
you are
able
not to
produce
a single
thought
it doesn't
mean that
thoughts are
going to
stop
forever
as Kezan
also said
sweep as
you may
you'll never
empty the
mind
but you
can
reach that
point
where there's
no eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
mind
you can
experience it
everybody
that has
experienced it
and there's
been thousands
hundreds of
thousands
who knows
how many
men and
women
tall ones
and short
Buddha body
parts
right
head arms
tongue
nose
all of it
but you
got to
keep going
when you
see the
smoke
don't
stop
you know
we've
often said
that this
practice
is for
long distance
runners
not sprinters
we see
lots of
sprinters
show up
all
filled
with
fire
what we
call piss
and vinegar
they're
going to
do it
you know
and
two weeks
later
a month
later
they're
gone
and they
were great
while they
were here
you know
they really
sat
like lions
worked
like horses
ate
like tigers
you know
did everything
to the fullest
but it's
not about
sprinting
it's about
the long
distance
run
little by
little
patiently
trusting
yourself
using
every means
at your
disposal
kezan
said
therefore
if you
want to
personally
experience
this realm
i have
elucidated
you must
penetrate
thoroughly
it doesn't
depend on
sitting
meditation
or on
calm
talk
what is
the principle
of the
secret
saying
not
concealed
and then
he gives
his poem
we could
call it
the
indestructible
eminent
body
sometimes
the diamond
body
that
body
is
empty
clear
and
luminous
when
the world
is
destroyed
it
is
indestructible
that's
a little
extra
it's
my
frost
added
to
the
snow
so
it's
got
nothing
to do
folks
with
passing
koans
having
answers
giving
great
talks
it's
got
nothing
to do
with
being
smart
or stupid
talkative
or silent
it's
got
nothing
to do
with
man
or
woman
monk
practice
or lay
practice
so
what's
the
secret
what's
the
truth
it's
not a
shout
it's
not
pointing
it's
not
silence
it's
not
knowing
or
not
knowing
we're
not
speaking
here
of
the
absolute
we're
not
speaking
here
of
the
relative
we're
not
speaking
of
neither
absolute
or
relative
we're
not
speaking
of
the
merging
of
absolute
and
relative
or
the
unity
of
absolute
and
relative
what we're
talking about
is the
principle
of the
secret saying
not
concealed
what is
it
we're
talking about
the mystic
meaning
realized
by
set
show
what is
it
well as
you know
those of
you that
have been
sitting here
for the
last
nine
days
it's
not
easy
but
we've
said a
lot of
things
but one
of the
things
we never
said
was that
it was
going to
be easy
the
practice
is
continuous
it
says
vital
to life
is air
water
and food
I can't
imagine
living
without
it
it's
a daily
source
of
nourishment
without
it
we live
a painful
life
die
a painful
death
with it
we can
live a
peaceful
life
die
a peaceful
death
but what
is it
that
dies
what
is it
that's
born
we say
that life
is the
unborn
birth
is the
unborn
and death
is the
unextinguished
what does
that mean
when we
don't
realize it
our life
becomes an
endless
source
of
difficulties
of
suffering
our
death
becomes
a
hindrance
and cause
fearfulness
constant
fearfulness
that's
why we
call the
whole
thing
the
great
matter
of
life
and
death
that's
why we
make it
very clear
that this
is the
only
reason
to
enter
into
training
at this
monastery
is to
settle
that
question
of
life
and
death
I
come
here
realizing
the
question
of
life
and
death
is a
great
matter
each
of you
that are
students
have
said
our
practice
is the
great
matter
of life
and
death
this
session
is the
great
matter
of life
and
death
so please
settle
it
be clear
what you're
doing
it's
it's
that
important
these
hours
that
remain
of
the
session
are just
overflowing
with
opportunity
the
only way
we can
repay
those
86
ancestors
that have
brought
this
incredible
dharma
to you
is by
realizing
ourselves
that was
the whole
point of
their
teaching
in their
existence
for you
to realize
yourself
when you
do that
you've
repaid
the debt
please
take care
of it
the
investments
it
that
these
people
and
get
re
what
are
them
you
they
and
as
as
of
a
e
it
one

the
