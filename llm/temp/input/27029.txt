The Gateless Gate
Murillo Soju's Poems on Oryo's Three Barriers
The Three Barriers is a koan that Master Oryo always used in questioning his disciples.
Master Murillo Soju made a poem on each one of these three barriers
and added one of his own at the end,
offering these poems as a way of thanking Master Mumon,
who had been kind enough to come and give tesho on the 48 koans.
Master Murillo Why is my hand like Buddha's hand?
I could feel the pillow at my back, and involuntarily I gave a great laugh.
In truth, the whole body is the hand.
Why is my leg like a donkey's leg?
Even before taking a step I have already arrived.
Freely I pass over the four seas just as I wish.
I ride backward on yogi's three-legged donkey.
Everyone has his own cause of birth.
Each has realized his antecedent determinant.
Nanta broke his bones and returned them to his father.
Did the fifth patriarch ever rely on any paternal relation?
Buddha's hand, donkey's leg, and the cause of birth.
They are neither Buddha, nor Tao, nor Zen.
Do not wonder why gateless barriers are so difficult.
They have aroused the monk's intense animosity.
Mumon was lately at Zyugan.
Settling down in the Zen seat, he criticized koan, old and new.
He cut off the ways for both the wise and the ordinary.
A number of dragons in hiding may stir up a peal of thunder.
Master Mumon has been invited as the leading monk.
I thank him with this humble poem.
Late Spring of the Third Year of Jyotai, 1230.
Written by Murillo Soju.
Some of you may not be familiar with Mumonkan.
Mumonkan is a collection of 48 koans
that are part of the koan system that we used here at Doshinji.
We start off with a first koan,
which can be any one of three or four first koans.
Usually it's mu, sometimes it's not.
And after completing that first koan,
the students then work on 200 miscellaneous koans.
The 200 miscellaneous koans are koans that are used
to refine one's understanding of mu, the first koan.
And by the completion of that sequence of koans,
the students should be in what we call
the fourth stage of training,
or the fourth ox-herding picture.
Should be beginning it.
The first stage of training is working with the breath.
Second stage of training is working with the koan, mu.
Third stage of training is working with the 200.
So in the fourth stage of training,
the student begins these 48 koans of Master Mumon.
In the fifth stage,
we work with the 100 koans of the Blue Cliff Record.
In the sixth stage,
we work with the 100 koans of the Book of Equanimity.
In the seventh stage,
we work with the koans of the transmission of the lamp.
In the eighth stage,
we work with the five ranks of Master Tozan.
And in the ninth stage,
the koans of the Precepts.
So for the students doing that track of training using koans,
it's a very comprehensive overview of both,
not only understanding,
one's understanding of these koans,
but also the historical context.
You get a lot of Buddhist history, philosophy,
and education in general
by working through each of the koans.
They total about 700.
The Master Mumon,
the name of the collection,
we loosely translate as the gateless gate,
but it's actually not an accurate translation.
Mumon is the name of the author
and also the name of the book.
Master Mumon.
Mu means no,
and mon means gate.
So, his name, Mumon,
meant no gate.
And kan means barrier.
So, Mumon kan means the no gate barrier,
or the barrier that has no gate.
And when you really look at it,
that's what this dharma is,
the gateless barrier,
a barrier with no gate.
And the reason it has no gate
is because there's no way to enter it.
It reaches everywhere.
It's like
a fish
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
looking
for the gate
to enter the Atlantic Ocean.
He's already in the midst of it.
And all of these koans
are that reality.
We're already in the midst of it.
And the only reason
it becomes a koan,
and the only reason
that everyday life koans
become koans,
is because we've put ourselves
outside of them.
And they become a barrier.
And that's why we say
whatever the barrier is,
the only way through it
is to be it.
When you are the barrier,
how can you speak
of a barrier?
It reaches everywhere.
It permeates
to ten directions.
And it's the same
as no barrier at all.
You see,
there's no place
to stand
to look at it.
and there's no place
to look at it.
And there's no place
to look at it.
Now,
Mooman,
at the end
of the collection
of his 48 koans,
there are some
additional koans
that we work with,
too.
The last
of Mooman's koans
is Kempos'
One Way.
And then there's
a Mooman's
Postscript
and Zen Warnings,
which we treat
as a koan here also.
A student has
to deal with that.
And following that
are these
three poems
on Orio's
Three Barriers
and then
Amban's
49th
talk.
And we do
each of these
as a koan.
Now,
to get a sense
of how all
of this
interrelates,
these koans
are part
of the
Rinzai
school's
way of teaching.
And of course,
our practice
here includes
both Rinzai
and Soto
school
methods of teaching.
And in fact,
the deeper
you get into Zen,
the more you realize
that it's
kind of ridiculous
to talk about
Rinzai school
and Soto school,
particularly in this country.
So those divisions
have pretty much
dissolved,
and particularly
here in our practice.
Now,
Master Rinzai,
the Rinzai school
was one of the
five great schools
of Zen
in Tang Dynasty.
And the only two
that survived
were the Rinzai school
and the Soto school
down to the present
day.
The other three
schools have died
away.
And then the Rinzai
school at one point
around,
during the
Sung Dynasty,
in a period
of about
1000
AD
to 1100 AD,
it split
into two schools.
One school
was the Yogi
school
and the other
school was the
Oryo school.
And the
Oryo school
was the school
that Master
Dogen
was first
transmitted to.
He,
after leaving
Mount Tendai,
went to study
at Isai's
monastery
and completed
koan study
under Master
Myozen there
and received
the transmission
of the Rinzai
school.
That was the
Oryo school.
That school
later died out
in Japan.
And actually
the only
place that
that school
remains is
in the
Dogen
lineages.
And then
the other
school,
the Yogi
school,
also was
transmitted to
Japan.
That's the
school of
Master Haku
in.
And that's
the school
that survives
today in
Japan.
All of the
Rinzai temples
of Japan are
part of the
Yogi
school.
And the
Yogi
school later
after Master
Hakuin
again split
into two
schools.
One is the
Takuju
and the
other is
the
Ngaku
schools.
Now in
the Takuju
school was
Harada Roshi
and Yastani
Roshi which is
one part of
our lineage
that comes
to us
through
Maizumi
Roshi.
In the
Ngaku
school is
Kori
Roshi.
which is
also part
of our
lineage.
So we
represent
basically the
teachings as
received in
three Zen
lineages.
The two
existing
Rinzai
schools and
the Soto
school have
all come
down and
are part of
the training.
Like those
200 koans are
200 koans that
are used in
the Ngaku
school, not
in the
Takuju
school.
Yet the
other koans
of the
Blue Cliff
record, for
example, are
koans that
are used in
the Takuju
school.
The school
and the
koans of
the Book
of Equanimity
and the
precepts are
used in
the Soto
school.
So by
combining all
of those it
kind of makes
a very, very
complete
training
representing
all of the
major
living
lineages
of Zen.
Now, Master
Soju
was a
contemporary
of Master
Muman.
And evidently
he was in
charge of a
monastery
and invited
the name of
the monastery
was
Zui Ganji.
And
this is what
Master Soju
said.
Recently Master
Muman stayed
at my
temple,
Zui Ganji,
and settled
down in
his Zen
seat.
He
criticized
old and
new without
reserve,
cut off
ways for
both saints
and ordinary
people alike.
There was no
holding him
back.
Now, that
position of
head monk,
basically,
is what he
was.
and in
those days
head monk
was the
equivalent
of what
we call
goto
today.
In a big
monastery,
the abbot
usually doesn't
do the
teaching.
The abbot
is basically
kind of an
administrator
and spiritual
leader of
the community,
but not
necessarily the
teacher.
It's the
same in
Christian
monasteries.
The abbot
has more
of an
administrative
responsibility.
And the
teaching in
Zen monasteries
is usually
done by
the goto.
And usually
the goto
and the
abbot
are old
teachers of
equivalent
understanding
and experience.
And so
Muman was
invited by
Soju,
they were
both equivalent
contemporaries,
to be the
head monk
and to teach
at his
monastery.
And so
in his
teaching,
these 48
koans came
out.
What he did
is he
selected koans
that he
thought were
important for
the training
of those
monks at
that time.
And then
later someone
collected them
and published
them and
it became
handed down
from generation
to generation.
And so
as a way
of appreciating
Master Muman,
Soju who
invited him
in the first
place,
took up
these three
barriers
of Master
Uriyo.
Now Uriyo,
you remember,
is one of the
lines of Zen,
the one in
particular that
was transmitted
by Isai to
Myozen and
then to
Dogen.
So he
was a famous
master,
Master Uriyo,
and
in his
biography
it says
that in
the
doksan
room,
the master
always asked
his monks,
everyone has
his own
cause of
birth,
what is
the cause
of your
birth?
He
squarely
faced the
student
and
exchanged
mando.
Then he
would also
hold out
his hand
and ask,
why is
my hand
like the
Buddha's
hand?
And as
a result
would test
the
understanding
of a
student
on his
training
journey.
Again he
would ask,
showing his
leg,
why is
my leg
like a
donkey's
leg?
and said
that for
over 30
years he
asked these
three
questions and
no one
could ever
satisfy him.
Many
tried to
answer and
Master
Uriyo never
said the
answer was
right,
never said
it was
wrong.
And the
monks call
them Uriyo's
three barriers.
What is the
cause of your
birth?
holding out
his hand,
why is
my hand
like the
Buddha's
hand?
Showing
his leg,
why is
my leg
like a
donkey's
leg?
And then
years later
Master
Soju added
a poem
to each
one of
these,
including
that line
in the
poem,
and brought
his
understanding
to bear
on it,
and then
added two
other little
poems in
addition to
that to
bring the
whole thing
together.
what is
the cause
of your
birth?
He changed
the order
around,
making
Buddha's
hand
first,
donkey's
leg
second,
and the
cause of
birth
last.
So his
first poem
is,
why is
my hand
like the
Buddha's
hand?
I could
feel the
pillow at
my back,
and involuntarily
I gave a
great laugh,
in truth,
the whole
body is
the hand.
One of the
things that
we work
on in our
practice,
and incidentally,
I probably
won't get
through all
three of
those in
this one
talk,
so what
I'll do
is pick
up on it
again tomorrow
and complete
it,
and I'll
review the
front part
again for
the benefit
of those
that will
be coming
tomorrow.
So one
of the
basic
things that
we do
in Zen
practice,
what you're
doing now,
is to
first off
try to
take all
of that
energy
that's
usually
scattered
and bring
it to
focus
on a
single
point.
All of
us have
a tremendous
potential,
tremendous
vitality
and energy,
but the
problem is
that we
waste it,
we scatter
it,
it's all
over the
place.
We're
doing one
thing,
thinking about
another
thing.
I remember
in one
of those
novels
about Zen,
I think
Empty
Mirror or
the other
one,
where this
Dutchman
was studying
at a
monastery
in Japan.
This guy
was a
writer,
so his
mind was
going all
the time.
And he
got several
novels out
of, I
think, a
year,
year and a
half stay
in Japan
at this
monastery.
And one
day after
he was
there,
about four
or five
months,
the head
monk
said to
him in
the bathroom
one day,
why don't
you shut
up?
He said,
you're always
talking,
you're always
preoccupying
yourself.
He says,
you try to
brush your
teeth,
urinate,
and talk
all at the
same time.
You can't
do all
those things
at the
same time.
What you
end up
doing is
peeing all
over the
guy next
to you,
not getting
your teeth
brushed,
and nobody
can understand
what you're
saying anyway.
So why
don't you
just shut
up?
And
basically,
that's what
we all try
to do.
Fifteen
things at
once,
and nothing
ever really
gets completed
or done
with any
kind of
depth.
It's all
superficial.
And so
the first
step in
our practice
is to
gather all
of that
energy and
bring it
together in
a single
point.
We work
with a
breath,
and we
work with
a horror,
a single
point of
that energy
in the
horror,
in the
body.
That's the
cosmic
consciousness
of Zen,
this whole
body and
mind.
It's not
out there
in never
never land.
It's right
here,
right now.
And so
we bring it
home.
We bring it
home by
practicing
returning to
that point
of concentration.
Some people
practice
shikantasa.
The end
result is the
same.
I've gone
over that
before.
Today I want
to concentrate
on how
it works
when you're
working with
a koan.
And little
by little
you build
joriki,
the power
of
concentration,
or self-power.
It's the
self-power
that's used
to break
through.
It's the
self-power
that's used
to penetrate
the koan.
And whether
you're sitting
shikantasa
or developing
concentration,
the result,
joriki,
is identical.
And it
not only
manifests
with a koan,
it manifests
in everything
that you do.
It's not
only mental
power,
the ability
to put your
mind where
you want
it,
but it's
also physical
power.
And it's
spiritual
power.
it's
human
power.
It's
what
we all
have
as a
potential
of our
life.
Few
realize it.
Most people
go to their
grave never
understanding
that potential.
And
ultimately,
that power
of concentration
results in
what we
call samadhi,
single
pointedness
of mind.
Or the
falling away
of body
and mind.
We talk
about it
in many
ways.
To forget
the self.
it begins
with first
and off
sensation
of the
body,
where
although
you know
that you
have a
body,
you don't
feel it.
Particularly
this happens
in a long
session
from not
moving for
long periods
of time.
It's simple.
It's not
esoteric.
You know,
if you don't
move your
body,
the clothes
don't produce
friction on
the surface
of the skin.
And it's
that friction
on the
surface
of the skin
that's
constantly
feeding
information
to your
consciousness
about where
the outline
of your
so-called
body is.
Stop
moving,
you stop
getting that
information.
It's like
floating around
in that
lily tank
where you're
not getting
input on
physical
sensations.
And of
course,
people freak
out when
they first
start
experiencing
that.
There's
these
involuntary
jerks
to reassure
ourselves.
Of course,
you can look
down and see
that you've
got a body.
It's there.
But you
can't feel
it.
And then
after a
while,
you get
used to
it.
And you
relax into
that.
And the
practice
continues.
Each time
your mind
drifts off,
you acknowledge
the thought
and bring
it back
again to
where you
want it.
And little
by little,
it drifts
off less
and less.
And each
time you
bring it
back,
you build,
you empower
yourself,
and you
build your
iki.
You empower
yourself with
the ability
to put your
mind where
you want
it and
to hold
it there.
It's your
mind.
You should
be able to
do what
you want
with it.
You can
do what
you want
with your
hand.
If you
want to
touch your
nose,
you do
it.
Put it
on top
of your
head,
you can
do it.
You want
to lie
down,
you know
how to
lie
down.
But try
to stop
thinking.
You can't
do it.
The very
thought fills
you with
activity.
We have
to learn
how to
do that.
We have
to learn
how to
do what
virtually every
creature on
the face of
the earth
knows how
to do.
That is
to just
shut up
and be
still.
Very
difficult
to do.
Seems
to be a
lost art
somewhere in
the process
of
evolution.
We've
forgotten
how to
be quiet
with
ourselves.
And sooner
or later,
there's that
falling away
of body
and mind.
Body falls
away,
and then after a while,
mind falls away.
And what that means
essentially is that the
witness
stops witnessing.
So you stop
talking to
yourself about
how good
your zazen is
or how bad
your zazen is
or all the
other things
you think
about.
And each
breath breathes
itself.
And the whole
illusion of time
falls away.
And that's
what we call
to forget
the self.
When there's
no self,
what remains?
And that
forgetting the
self is the
thing that's
most frightening
to people
because just
by its
very nature,
the sound
of it
sounds awful.
What will I
be if I
don't have
a self?
Well,
what
remains
when there's
no self?
The whole
universe.
Everything.
Everything
remains.
There's no
longer
an idea
that separates
us from
everything.
There's
no limit
to us
as there
is no
limit to
the
universe.
So when
the self
is forgotten,
can there
be anything
in the
whole
universe
that's
not the
self?
and then
when you
see,
the whole
body and
mind
is the
eye.
When the
whole body
and mind
is the
eye,
it's the
same.
It's not
seeing anymore.
You can't
speak of
seeing anymore.
It fills
the universe.
Seeing and
not seeing
no longer
exists.
The dualities
disappear.
There's
nothing
outside of
it
seeing.
When you
hear,
your whole
body and
mind is
the ear.
And again,
it can't be
called
hearing.
When you
hold,
the whole
body and
mind is
holding.
The whole
body and
mind is
the hand.
So you
can no
longer call
it holding.
When you
walk,
the whole
body and
mind is
the foot.
It's no
longer.
Walking,
walking,
not walking,
doesn't exist.
The word
walking becomes
an absurdity
when the
whole body
and mind
is involved
in it.
That's what
Dogen
Senji
means when
he says
seeing
form with
the whole
body and
mind.
Hearing
sound with
the whole
body and
mind.
One
understands
it
intimately.
When the
hand is
the whole
body and
mind,
that's the
heart of
the martial
arts.
That's what
karate means,
empty hand.
that's the
bottom line
of Zen
brushwork.
The art
of the
sword,
of the
bow.
When the
whole body
and mind
is the
eye,
it's the
heart of
all the
visual arts
of Zen.
And the
wonderful
thing about
all of
this,
the
marvelous
thing about
it,
is you
don't have
to understand
Buddhist
psychology,
philosophy,
or history
to forget
the self.
You don't
need an
IQ of
150 to
forget the
self.
The self
is an
idea.
In
Buddhism,
we call it
an illusion
or the
delusion.
It's the
cause of
all suffering.
Why is
my hand
like the
Buddha's
hand?
I could
feel the
pillow at
my back
and
involuntarily
I gave
a great
laugh.
In truth,
the whole
body is
the hand.
The whole
body is
the hand.
But even
to call it
whole body
is the
hand
misses it.
So how
do you
answer?
Why is
my hand
like the
Buddha's
hand?
Without
speech,
without
words,
without
silence.
And some
of you may
remember the
koan of
Master
Ungan and
Dogo.
Ungan asked
Dogo,
what does
Kanon Bodhisattva
have so many
hands and
eyes for?
Dogo said,
it's like a
person who
searches for
his pillow
in the middle
of the night
with his
hand groping
behind him.
Ungan said,
I understand.
Dogo says,
what do you
understand?
Ungan said,
the whole
body is
hand and
eye.
Dogo said,
that's
pretty good,
but it's
only 80%.
Ungan said,
how would
you say
it,
Master?
And Dogo
said,
the entire
body is
hand and
eye.
What's
the difference
between those
two statements?
You can't
call it a
hand,
yet it
cannot be
said it's
not a
hand.
What is
it?
What is
it?
The heart
of Master
Soju's poem
here is
the same
as the
heart of
that
koan.
The second
poem is,
Why is
my leg
like a
donkey's
leg?
Even
before taking
a step
I have
already
arrived.
Freely I
pass over
the four
seas just
as I
wish.
I ride
backward on
yogi's
three-legged
donkey.
So he
would show
his leg
to the
monks
and say,
Why is
my leg
like a
donkey's
leg?
The first
thing we
need to
not get
confused
about is
such words
as Buddha's
hand or
donkey's
leg.
The
truth needs
to be
seen
immediately
without
getting
caught up
in the
words.
What is
Buddha?
What is
donkey?
Again,
what can
be said
about the
hand?
Can be
said about
the leg.
When the
whole body
and mind
is the
leg.
The whole
universe
is the
leg.
There's
nothing
outside
of the
leg.
So even
before taking
a step,
I've already
arrived.
Just like
the fish
in the
middle of
the
Atlantic
looking
for gaining
entrance to
the water,
before he
moves,
he's
arrived.
just like
each of
us
searching
for the
way,
before we
move,
we've
arrived.
When the
leg fills
the whole
universe,
it's the
same as
no
leg.
How can
we speak
then of
taking a
step or
not taking
a step?
obviously he
can step
over the
four seas
without
lifting a
leg.
way.
And that
last line,
I ride
backward on
yogi's
three-legged
donkey.
Once a
monk asked
Master Yogi,
what is
Buddha?
A
three-legged
donkey goes
by clattering
his hooves,
answered
Master Yogi.
three-legged
donkey is
another name
for the
one who
has
transcended
their
leg.
Or it's
another name
for the
true self,
the
Buddha
nature.
But Soju
says that
he rides
backward
on that
three-legged
donkey.
And to
ride
backwards
on that
three-legged
donkey is
obviously
someone with
a lot of
experience in
donkey
riding.
What is
it
it
expresses
is
absolute
freedom.
Absolute
freedom.
It's
based on
the true
self of
no form.
No form
means it
reaches
everywhere.
No form
means it's
all form,
every form.
that the
skin bag
is not
who we
are.
It's the
smallest part
of who
we are.
Now this
leg
and this
hand
it's
come up
many times
in different
ways.
hand of
Oryu,
Gutai's
finger,
Rinzai's
fist,
Buddha's
flower.
Are they
the same
or are
they
different?
See,
the
Dharmakaya
we sometimes
think of,
the Dharmakaya
is the
great void.
and in
fact it
is,
no form.
But it's
also the
nature of
the self,
true
nature,
Buddha
nature,
the nature
of all
things.
Here's
another
poem
for you
to
contemplate.
This
miraculous
hand
clutching
and
letting
go.
Reaching
into
heaven
it
plucks
the
angel's
wings.
Penetrating
into
hell
it
smothers
the
inferno.
Nothing
remains
to compare
it to.
How can
it be
called
Buddha's
hand?
And what
do you
call it?
how is
this
hand
like
the
Buddha's
hand?
How is
this
leg
like
the
donkey's
leg?
How is
your
body
the
body
of
the
Buddha?
Find out
if you
don't
know.
in the
very
process
of
that
find
out
you
give
life
to
the
Buddha.
You
save
all
sentient
beings.
Not
in the
goal
in the
process
you
give
life
to
the
Buddha.
And
sometimes
the
deeper
our
practice
goes
and
the
closer
we
get
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff.
The
closer
the
more
resistance
begins
to
come up.
That
resistance
takes
many,
many
forms.
Going
unconscious,
getting
sick,
getting
angry.
I
don't
need
this.
Thank
you,
I
understand
enough.
Thank
you,
but I've
got other
things to
do.
All
kinds
of
ways
to
avoid
studying
the
self.
The
biggest
thing
we
need
is
determination,
intimacy,
faith,
faith in
yourself.
Trusting
yourself,
knowing you
can do
it,
knowing you
will do
it,
not I'll
try,
I will
do it.
and that
determination
is each
time you
go off,
you
acknowledge
it and
bring it
back.
You go
off,
you bring
it back.
And
working
with the
breath,
or working
with the
koan,
working
with mu,
be it
with the
whole body
and mind.
What that
means is
to make
it
physical,
tactile,
tangible,
feel the
breath,
feel mu,
make it
mental,
hold it
in your
mind,
make it
spiritual,
experience it
with the
whole body
and mind,
make it
personal,
make it
intimate,
be the
breath,
be mu,
forget
the self.
and most
of all,
throw away
expectations,
be ready
for anything.
We're very
fortunate
to have the
opportunity to
practice
the
Buddha
way.
been over
a million
years of
human
evolution
and we
look back
on our
history.
Basically,
it sucks.
It's a
history of
war,
aggression.
We're slowly
destroying our
planet.
We're still
locked into
the patterns
of ego
behavior that
our primordial
ancestors
needed in
order to
survive
the
environment
and the
saber-toothed
tiger.
That same
syndrome is
still functioning.
And the
power that
that syndrome
provided that
made us
survive
is available
without the
syndrome.
I used
to wonder
why
someone
hasn't
figured it
out.
Well,
a long
time people
have figured
it out.
For
2,500
years people
have been
practicing it.
Hundreds
of thousands
of men and
women have
passed through
that gateless
barrier to
freedom,
to clarity.
And now
here we
sit on
this mountain
face to
face with
the opportunity
of a
lifetime.
What we
do is
finally up
to each
one of
us.
Our
karma
brings us
to this
point.
But we
still can
choose to
go forward
or to
turn and
go the
other way.
Either way
is okay.
Ultimately,
it's your
ballgame.
It's not
easy to
die the
great death,
the death
of the
ego.
It's the
most difficult
thing any
of us will
ever have
to do.
But when
you die
once,
you can
never die
again.
To realize
itself,
the self
takes one
moment in
time.
It gives
us the
opportunity
to realize
for ourselves,
for each
one of
us,
that human
potential
that we're
born with.
And that
is the
ability to
live this
life to
its fullest
in peace,
in harmony,
and alive
and vital.
That's what
life is.
Peaceful,
harmonious,
alive and
vital.
every day
is a
good day.
When
there's no
vain thought,
the cloud
of mine.
But don't
believe a
single word
that I
say.
Find out
for yourself.

continue
tomorrow.
Thank you.
