the book of equanimity case 57 gone yours thing
preface to the assembly playing with reflections struggling for the form you
don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection raising your
voice to stop an echo you don't know that the voice is the root of the echo if
it's not riding an ox looking for an ox then it's using a wedge to remove a
wedge how can you avoid these extremes the main case the venerable gonyo asked
joshu when not a single thing is brought then what joshu said put it down
gonyo said if I don't bring the single thing what should I put down joshu said
then carry it out the verse not prepared for meticulous action he loses the first to
move realizing himself the coarseness of his mind he is embarrassed at bumping
his head when the game is ended the axe handles rotted at his side clean and
purify the ordinary bones to play with the immortals and this koan addresses the
business of the baggage and blinders that we carry with us all the time and how it
restricts what we can see and how we can function and what our capacity is that really addresses
the question of how to be free we fill ourselves with ideas opinions positions or it's with fear
anxiety greed or anger or after many years of practice we fill ourselves with understanding with
spirituality with clarity with accomplishment or we fill ourselves with attachment or non-attachment or
sacredness or sacredness or profaneness all of these things fill the cup all of these things
make it impossible to be open to be receptive to receive to truly see hear taste touch feel
they're all based on separation they're all based on the mind moving grabbing onto things
this week and this weekend we did two workshops one of the workshops was a hermitage workshop
at the heart of that workshop was sacred space
well i ask you how do you recognize sacred space what is sacred space what is profane space
what is sacred inner space and is inner space and outer space different
if so how is it different if not why not
we did a workshop also on the mind of movement
i've asked four people who did that workshop what is the mind of movement
movement no one was able to answer me where is it what is it can you bring it to me
there's a mind of movement there must be a mind of still stillness what is that
it's very easy to get caught up in all of the ideas that describe practice and to miss in the process the practice itself
we're always
we're always
we're always
we're always
we're always
we're always
we're always
accomplishing something chasing something
and while we're doing that
while we're
the place
the place upon which we stand
and yet there's not a one of us
that ever fails
to fill that space
completely
completely
in the introduction
this is playing with reflections
struggling for form
you don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection
by preoccupying ourselves with the ideas that describe the reality we miss the reality
the ideas of the reflection of that reality
the ideas of the words and concepts that we use to describe that
but what's the reality itself
it's easy to draw pictures
it's easy to talk about it
but unless you see for yourself personally what it is
it doesn't impart any strength
raising your voice to stop an echo
you don't know the voice is the root of the echo
it doesn't matter what we attach to
the result is the same
whether you're attaching to a Mercedes
or to Buddhism
or to enlightenment
the delusion is just
as deep
and the delusion doesn't have to do
with Mercedes
being profane
and enlightenment being sacred
neither of them
are profane or sacred
it's got to do with attachment
it's got to do with holding on
in order to hold on
in order to hold on
we need the holder
and the thing that the holder is holding
that's two
the reality
realized and actualized
by all of the Buddhas
and sages and enlightened ones
is not two
so the question is
so the question is
how do you transcend
that duality of this and that
self and other
of sacred and profane
of mind and no mind
how can you avoid
how can you avoid
these extremes
the venerable Gonyo
asked Joshu
when not a single thing is brought
then what?
Joshu said
put it down
what's he talking about?
if there's not a single thing
what is there to put down?
another monk
once asked
Master Hoji
when feelings arise
wisdom is blocked
when characteristics change
the body differs
how is it when feelings haven't arisen?
the Master said blocked
the monk said
if feelings haven't arisen
the monk said
if feelings haven't arisen
what can they block?
this is exactly
the same question
that this question is
in this coin
the Master commenting on this said
brash fellows are much the same
Joshua said to him
then put it down
then put it down
then put it
then carry it out
you can't put it down
carry it out
carry it with you
Gonyo said
if I don't bring the single thing
what should I put down?
if I have nothing
what is there to get rid of?
I have nothing
I have nothing
is something
it's a big something
it's what we call
the sickness
of having no sickness
whatsoever
the Master
wrote a verse on this coin
he said
not bringing a single thing
both shoulders can't bear it up
that's how big it is
not a single thing
it's so heavy
he can barely carry it
at the words
he suddenly knows his error
in his heart
his boundless joy
since from poisonous ill
he forgot
what was on his mind
snakes and tigers
have been his intimates
empty and still
empty and still
for a thousand years
the pure breeze
still hasn't stopped
somehow
when we talk about things
and
it's the basic
method of communication
that we have
it doesn't get through
doesn't seem to register
when we say again
and again and again
every one of these koans
is presenting the truth
every talk
every sutra
every verse
is constantly pointing to it
and nobody sees it
in this koan itself
Ganyo
when Joshu said
then carry it out
Ganyo was enlightened
all of you are hearing the same thing
so we should have a mass kensho
why doesn't it happen
why is it that sometimes the words connect
and other times they don't connect
building of the hermitage
building of the hermitage
where was the teaching
I have a student
that's been practicing here for about six years
that's what she asks me
every time she comes to Doksan
she describes some event that happened
and then she says where was the teaching
where is the teaching
sometimes it's hard to see
there's a classic story
I forget who it is
either Milarepa or Naropa
one or two or the other
one or both of them maybe
one was the master
one was the disciple
the disciple was a great builder
a carpenter
an expert
a professional
those are the most difficult to deal with
experts and professionals
and particularly when you're dealing with them
in their own field
of expertise
and professionalism
it's as if the door were closed
there's nothing else to learn
and definitely nothing to learn
from someone who was not
a fellow professional
or expert in that field
and so such was the case
in this disciple
who came to the master
and said please teach me
the master said you're a builder aren't you
he said yes
he said then please
build me a house
build a large house
four stories high
and so many feet wide
many feet deep
and he described how he wanted it
and he said I want it here
so the builder set to work on it
if he would build this house
he would receive the teachings
he worked on it for three years
finally it was complete
he told the master
here it is
just like you asked
what are the teachings
the master said
the master said I didn't tell you
to build it there
I said build it over there
so take it down
and build it over there
and he took it down
and you rebuilt it over there
three years later
when it was complete
he came back
he said the house is finished
where are the teachings
he said that's not where I said to build it
I wanted it over there
there
take it down and move it
build it over there
down came the house
up it went
and the next place
halfway through it
he realized
himself
he realized
the teachings
he understood
what was going on
what is it that's going on
in the building
where is the teaching
is it
the finished building
is it the sacred place
is it the design
the discussions
what is the teaching in Zazen
you just sit there doing nothing
the passing
where is the teachings
in the service
in the chanting
in the bowing
where is the teachings in the work
if you wait
for someone to give it to you
you waste your time
it can't be given
if you wait to receive it
from someone
from someone
or somewhere
you waste your time
it can't be received
ten thousand Buddhas
couldn't give it to you
not a single one of them
has ever received it
and what is this marvelous
teaching
that can't be given
can't be received
I remember a very similar thing
happening to me
I went to study
with
Mina White
Mina White
was a professor of photography
at MIT
was also known as the
eastern guru of
photography because
there was unusual ways
of teaching
I had admired his
photography
and I had admired his work
for many many years
and finally
an opportunity came to go
and study with him
ten days of intensive study
how intensive
I hadn't even dreamed of
and had a very large sum of money
which took a long time to gather
and finally I got to the workshop
and immediately
first day
four o'clock in the morning
we were all out in the field
sixty of us
dancing
the teacher that I had spent
a thousand dollars
to study with
was dancing in the line
with us
there was a strange woman
up in front of us
showing us
how to move
and then after we
danced we did
meditation
then we did yoga
then I
had to be a camera
while someone
led me around
my eyes closed
and I had to dance with a tree
four days
I never touched my camera
we didn't take a picture
where is the teaching
I asked
and the old man smiled
and before that
ten days was finished
my whole life
was turned upside down
turned upside down
he had opened my eyes
by ripping the eyelids off
I went there filled with expectation
on what a photography teacher has to do
what does it mean to study photography
what does it mean to know the difference between looking and seeing
filled with all of those expectations and ideas
there was no room
there was no room
for anything else
that kind of blindness
prevents us
from hearing
seeing
receiving
touching
tasting
when not a single thing
is brought
then what
this
monk
was convinced
he didn't have
a single thing
just that idea
itself
is a burden
that's totally unbearable
it just crushes you into the earth
the earth
smothers you
covers you
blinds you
deafens you
numbs you
that's why
joshu said
put it down
if I don't bring the single thing
what should I put down
someone
someone that's not carrying a single thing
doesn't ask
that kind of question
he persisted
in believing that he didn't have a single thing
so joshu said then carry it out
there's nothing you can do with someone like this
it's completely closed
completely full
one of the things that we run into
all the time
is not having a question
Akin Roshi talks about it in his book
Taking the Path of Zen
he describes it
in terms of when he was a school teacher
he said when he was a school teacher
the student that threw a piece of chalk at him
when his back was turned
he was able to do something with
there was a possibility for communication
but the one that did nothing
was hopeless
there was nothing that could be done
so many people
don't have a question
if when everyone else panics
you remain calm
perhaps you don't understand the problem
there's always a possibility
without a question
the person is either dull
dimwitted
or a dead horse
or a dead horse
Buddha talked about the four kinds of horses
a horse that moves at the shadow of a whip
a horse that only moves when the whip touches its skin
or a horse that only moves when the whip cuts its skin
he said that
and he always compared that to a kind of student
one that moves at the shadow of the whip
you don't even need to say anything
it knows and it goes
he never mentioned the dead horse
the dead horse is my own classification
there's nothing you can do with a dead horse
except a nice memorial service perhaps
bury it
before it stinks
so either of those three things
usually smothers any kind of question
but also
some people are forgetful
that is their
mind keeps bouncing
from thing to thing
so the question never materializes itself
it never crystallizes into something
or they have a full house
that is a full deck
or a full cup
there's no room for any questions
or sometimes they're frightened
that's very similar to forgetful
that creates a lot of scattered energy
and it's hard to bring it all
to a point
and there's always
the possibility
that the person is enlightened
someone who has realized themselves
someone who is clear
that rhinoceros horn of doubt
is completely shattered
it's always
very easy
to tell these
different types apart
so we reveal it
every time
with every movement we reveal it
with every word that we say
we reveal it
with every gesture
every action
it's not difficult
to tell which is which
in the verse it says
not prepared for meticulous action
he loses
to the first move
the first move
realizing himself
the coarseness of his mind
he is embarrassed
at bumping his head
when the game has ended
the axe handles
rotted at his side
clean and purify
the ordinary bones
to play with the immortals
not prepared for meticulous action
he loses to the first move
of course this is a reference to
Joshu
the master
and Gonyo
the disciple
in that interchange
it also
is using as an example
a game of chess
you know
there's no contest
in a chess game
unless you move
two opponents
stand there
no one makes a move
there's no game
or when you can't move
there's no game
so there's got to be that movement
for something to happen
that's what the question is
otherwise you'll sit there
and rot
the reference to the
axe handles
being rotted
has to do with an old
legend
about someone
around the year
400
in China
who was off in the mountains
gathering firewood
when he came to a
stone grotto
he looked in
and there were four boys
in there playing chess
they gave him something
that looked like a date
and after he ate it
he wasn't hungry anymore
when the game was ended
the axe handle
that he had
had rotted at his side
and his clothes
had completely
disintegrated
kind of a rip
van winkle
story
several decades
had passed
during that period of time
not prepared for meticulous action
he loses to the first move
realizing himself
the coarseness of his mind
he is embarrassed at bumping his head
the coarseness of his mind
is that attachment
grabbing on to everything
that's why I ask you
what is the mind
what is the mind of movement
where is it
is it large
is it small
is it different in the mind of stillness
is it different than the enlightened mind
or the ordinary mind
one master commenting on this
said that some say that
pure tranquility
is the real basis of the path
the unconcerned
are little immortals
and he goes on to say
even so
don't take unconcerned
for unconcerned
time
and again
concern is born
of unconcern
what kind
of person
is a person that has no question
obviously it's someone that has all the answers
differences
no concern
is the same as no question
one master added
commentaries line by line
on this koan
where Ganyo asked Joshu
when not a single thing is brought
then what
footnote says
is still beyond him
when not a single thing is brought
is beyond him
put it down
the robe and shirt
the commentary says
the robe and shirt sticking to the body
understand that you should shed them
you should shed them
Ganyo said if I don't bring a single thing
what should I put down
footnote says people don't know their own faults
oxen don't know the magnitude of their strength
it's very hard to see ourselves
very easy to deceive ourselves
and one of the biggest diseases of all the diseases
is that we carry the same patterns
throughout our life
that's the difficulty
that's the conditioning
and it starts at such a young age
that we're not even aware of it
there's a little bit of our program
that comes from our parents
from our teachers
from our culture
from our nation
from our religion
from our peers
from our education
so that by the time we're full grown
we walk around like robots
responding to circumstances
and to people
according to the program
like every good robot should
there's no freedom
there's no originality
there's no vitality
there's no life
our noses are in the hands of that program
how do we break free of it
well we'll do spiritual practice
and what we proceed to do is to replace
all of the things we were holding on to
that are so-called material things
with all the new spiritual things
now we cling
to robes and raksus
the smell of incense
chanting and bowing
koans, enlightenment
realization, zen
until the stink is so great
it permeates the ten directions
it's the same thing all over again
just with a whole new set of names
we still haven't gotten to the root of it
we've taken care of the reflection
but we haven't taken care of the form
how do you get to the root of things?
the first
and most important lesson
is to learn how to just simply
shut up
and sit
not just sit
but shut up and sit
nobody ever taught us that
nobody ever taught us that
with all of the
understanding and knowledge in the world
this is probably
the single most important
the ability
to be able to shut up
and sit
our ancestors had that ability
the stone age cultures had that ability
cats and dogs have that ability
cats and dogs have that ability
hummingbirds and butterflies
know how to get still
but somehow
we seem to have lost it
somewhere in the process of evolution
20th century humanity
is constantly frantic
we may outwardly appear calm
but inside it's constantly churning
the mind is moving and grabbing and clinging
and manipulating and turning
understanding, analyzing, judging, categorizing
time to shut up and sit
sounds easy
sounds easy
it's not
probably the most difficult thing
any of us will ever do in our lives
and just because you put on a grey robe and a rock suit
doesn't make it happen
or a black robe and a kesa
doesn't make it happen
we sit there and for a moment
there's stillness
and then for the next five years
we appreciate the stillness
wasn't it beautiful?
isn't it nice?
I wonder if it's the same as Joshu's stillness
and cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
and it's long gone
it's no longer functioning
that simple stillness
is a constant practice
no matter how far we evolve
no matter how enlightened we become
no matter how many daiken shows
and how much clarity
always
we must return to the source
that stillness
a mind that doesn't move
is filled with possibilities
everything is possible
the mind that moves
there are no possibilities
we do a little exercise in a photography workshop here
I ask the students to go out
and to photograph
with no preconceived idea
of what their subject is going to be
to just go out and discover it
or be discovered
by the subject
don't look for it
don't go out with a preconceived idea
because if you go out with a preconceived idea
two things can happen
one is you'll find what you're looking for
and the other is
you won't find what you're looking for
in either case
you're blind
to everything else
to the ten thousand things
to the whole phenomenal universe
to everything that you
hear, see, smell, taste and touch
and the only way
to be open and receptive to all of that
to unify with all of that
is to put down the baggage
unload the saddlebags
strip off the blinders
naked
and free
everything is possible
there are no hindrances
the last line says
clean and purify the ordinary bones
to play with the immortals
and what he's saying
is that each one of us
just as we are
just as we are
contains
all of the clarity
all of the possibilities
of the sages
the wise ones
the enlightened ones
but it's buried
we can't see it
we can't feel it
in that simple
direct practice of zazen
just being with the breath
breath after breath
without anything extra
just watching the flow of your thoughts
without any outside help
within that
is the power
to take the darkness
out of the night
within that
is the power
to see beyond
the light of day
then you will realize for yourself
that the truth
that the way
has nothing to do with either
lightness or darkness
either absoluteness
or relativeness
either sacredness
or profaneness
moving mind
still mind
heavenly mind
earthly mind
the ordinary bones
are the bones of the immortals
the ordinary bones
your bones and my bones
are the bones of the sages and wise ones
it's just
that it's so hard to see it
because of all that activity
because of all of that conditioning
because of all the things
we hold on to
it's truly
nothing special
what we're speaking of
it's truly
the ordinary life
of each one of us
easy to talk about
very difficult to see
I only wish
is that you take back
from this week of study
this weekend of study
just a little bit of that zazen
and bring it into your life
start each day with it
end each day with it
ten minutes
just that much time out of your day
give it an opportunity to work
but really do it
don't just sit there
engage it
work with it
be the breath
breath after breath
forget the self
when you forget the self
there's nothing
to hang on to
there's no one to do the hanging
empty and still
for a thousand years
the pure breeze
the pure breeze
still hasn't stopped
that pure breeze
is the life of each one of us
present every day
every moment
from before we were born
to continue long after we're born
it's only a matter of
seeing it
for yourself
ending
being in the same works
precisely
being in the same place
is not makingident
a new journey
for a long time
moving up
coming up
with the body
once you go
next to your life
