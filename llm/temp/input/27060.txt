He means he made himself free.
The nose is the nose ring.
Up to that point he was being led around by a nose ring.
The nose ring was his own so-called understanding
of the truth that made him blind to everything else.
So he saved his nose.
He got rid of the nose ring by realizing himself.
But he lost his eyes.
He became blind.
Before he doubted everything.
Now he doubts nothing.
No differentiation.
Blind. Blind.
But what kind of blindness?
What happened in that freedom is the idea of the self fell away.
He forgot the self.
But I'm blowing out the candle for him at that right moment.
The self was forgotten.
But to be mu.
To really be mu.
Is to forget the self.
To be the koan.
Is to forget the self.
To be the breath.
To do zazen with the whole body and mind.
Is to forget the self.
Body and mind falling away.
Is to forget the self.
No self.
No other.
That's the bottom line.
Of the teachings of the Buddha.
Regardless of the school of Buddhism.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Tibetan.
Vietnamese.
Korean.
Zen.
Pure land.
Nichiren.
All of them.
From the beginning.
2,500 years.
All of them.
Are based on an Atman.
No self.
How you get to that point.
The different schools.
But just like Christianity.
The thing they have in common.
Is Christ.
The thing that Buddhist schools have in common.
Is no self.
An Atman.
And to forget the self.
Is zazen.
Not the zazen of meditation.
But the zazen.
That includes every aspect.
Of our life.
The zazen of walking.
And working.
Of eating.
Of breathing.
Moment to moment zazen.
That we call our life.
That's where you'll realize it.
So be the breath.
Be Mu.
Be the koan.
Be the moment.
Forget the self.
Your mother.
They all of them.
Do you.
Be.
Do you.
Do you.
Do.
A blue clef record.
Case 78.
Sixteen bodhisattvas go in to bathe.
The main case.
In olden times there were sixteen bodhisattvas.
When it was time for the monks to wash, the bodhisattvas filed in to bathe.
Suddenly they awakened to the basis of water.
All of you Zen worthies, how will you understand their saying?
Subtle feeling reveals elimination.
And we have achieved the station of Buddhahood.
To realize this, you too must be extremely piercing and penetrating.
As the set shows verse.
I only need one patch-rowed monk who understands this matter.
Stretch out your legs on the long bench and lie down.
In a dream you once spoke of awakening to perfect pervasiveness.
Though you're washed in fragrant water, I'll spit right in your face.
I ticked this coin for today and tomorrow.
And actually those will be the only two remaining talks I give.
So Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Myotai, Shugen and Myotai.
Jikyo, Myotai and Shugen.
We'll be giving talks while I'm away at a psychology conference in Washington.
So please support them and finish off this session real strong.
This coin gives me an opportunity to address some of the things that I talked about.
At the opening of the session, we call this the Thanksgiving session.
And this is that time of year where there's an expression of thanks.
Where there's giving and receiving.
Where there's a real sense of harmony and unity.
With each other, with all beings.
More so this time of year because it's so emphasized in the particular holidays of this time of year.
And I'd like to look at some of those things.
Thanksgiving.
Giving.
Business of harmony.
Harmony of the Sangha.
The work of the Bodhisattva.
Which is the life of each one of us.
To really look at that in depth and see what it means.
And see the places that we miss what our practice is about.
The other day, someone asked me.
What are the things that Buddhism does not address?
And it's kind of interesting.
That's a modern American Buddhist myth that's been created by American Buddhists who have failed to address the 10,000 things as their lives.
And it's very easy to do that.
And I see us doing it all the time.
We do it as a Sangha.
We do it as individuals.
It's easy to, via Bodhisattva, with the environment, for example.
It's easy to want to take care of the environment, not pollute it.
There's nothing coming back directly that pushes our buttons.
With that.
The way it is with putting the same amount of giving and loving to another human being.
Because human beings are not always grateful for what we put out.
And it's kind of interesting, you know, if you reach out to a person.
And because of their pain, they say,
Get lost, you bastard.
We're deeply hurt.
And it closes us down.
And we don't want to deal with it anymore.
And yet, at the same time, if you were helping an injured dog and you got bitten,
you wouldn't close down.
You'd understand that the animal is hurting.
And pain will bite back, you know, let veterinarians muzzle them.
So that doesn't happen.
You know, one of our members, I just remembered the comment one of our members made about working,
working, and there are several here that work in emergency rooms and trauma units and so on,
with people that are gravely injured.
And that so much of the time, they're attacked and cursed by the very people that they're helping.
They sometimes have to defend themselves against the very person that they're helping.
And the police, it's the same thing.
And that's one of the things that kind of closes us down.
Also, in order to help, there's a certain amount of vulnerability that's involved.
We have to let our guard down.
And I watch, and quite frankly, feel fully responsible myself,
that somehow I'm failing to communicate when I see it happening.
And it doesn't happen a lot, but it happens often enough to tell me
that what we've got is our practice in one pocket and our lives in the other pocket.
And that basically what we're doing, in terms of our practice,
when we say, you know, Zen doesn't address this, or the Buddha Dharma doesn't address that,
is that essentially we're not addressing it.
Zen is not a method.
It doesn't have a specific set of things.
This is how you deal with this, and this is how you deal with that.
What it has is a fundamental way of perceiving oneself in the universe.
And before you realize for yourself what that fundamental way of perceiving yourself in the universe is,
there are ways that you can practice that.
That's what the precepts are.
That's what the six paramitas are.
But our tendency is not to practice the edge,
to move back from the edge and practice a place that's safe.
So, we invite the entire community in for a dana dinner so that we can give.
And by the same token, and at the same time,
we ignore, among our own sangha,
the people that are in need, that reach out.
It's easy to take care of the homeless.
You feed them and they go home.
It's not so easy when you have to live with somebody.
And you're aware of their isolation or their loneliness,
but it's just too tacky to be intimate, to get involved.
So, we step back.
We look the other way.
We change the subject.
We avoid, rather than coming, bringing our practice into that.
That's a failure.
That's a failure.
Not of the dharma, but of those of us that practice the dharma.
It's my failure.
It's my failure for not communicating it strongly enough
that sangha is,
the word sangha means,
the virtue of harmony.
It's non-dual.
It's intimate.
Dogen Zenji had a lot to say about
the bodhisattva and the bodhisattva ideal.
We chant it every day.
We remind ourselves constantly
what it means to be a bodhisattva.
And we make the gesture of doing that.
And it's not just here.
It's in all of the sanghas.
It's in our affiliate groups.
We want to help.
We want to help.
But we want to help in a way that it's not too sticky.
That we don't get too dirty.
That it doesn't set our schedule
or the things that we have to do.
We want to help, but
please don't make it too difficult.
And that's why it's so easy to
to buy your way when you've got money.
Give them 25 bucks and get them off your back
and then feel okay that you helped the homeless.
Walk down the street and hand money out to panhandlers
and satisfy yourself that you've done something
for homelessness in this country.
And quite frankly, I don't know
what to do except to address the fact.
The things that the Dharma doesn't address
are the things that we don't address.
The Dharma is each one of us.
It's not something outside of us.
It's not some kind of a rule book.
It's not some kind of a list of ways of doing things.
It's our life.
It's a way of living that life.
And it's got to do with other people.
And I say it over and over.
Maybe it's too abstract.
Maybe it's too poetic.
Maybe we need to prescribe precisely
how to do it.
Let's look at this again.
I'm going to come back to this.
I need to come back to this in great detail
today and tomorrow.
I can't cover it all today.
Getting back to the Khaan,
the 16 bodhisattvas of the bath,
this is a story out of the Suragama Sutra.
And like all of these sutras,
you know, when you read them,
and like all of the things that we do,
the koans,
the poems,
the sutras,
the gathas,
we have a tendency to say them
but not hear them.
And somehow cognition is not taking place.
It's not affecting us
where it needs to affect us
in order for it to translate
into the activity
that it describes.
In this Suragama Sutra,
there's a particular episode
in which 25 bodhisattvas
relate their experiences
of attaining realization.
The first bodhisattva
and four others,
that is the first,
these were the first five disciples
of Shakyamuni Buddha,
stand up and describe
how they came to realization.
One of them says,
as for my realization,
seeing a sight
was the primary cause of it.
And the second,
whose name was Kyogun,
which means solemn smell.
What a name.
Can you imagine having that name?
I often wondered,
what is a solemn smell?
Probably incense.
He said,
smelling a scent
was the cause of my realization.
The third,
Yakko,
which was,
the name translates as
medicine kings
or superb
medicine kings,
cited the tasting
as the cause
of their realization.
Fourth,
Bhada Bhadra
and 15 other bodhisattvas
that are part of this present
kohan,
stand up,
bow to the Buddha,
Buddha.
And Bhada Bhadra says,
we formally heard
the preaching
of the first Buddha
and became monks.
At the monks' bath time,
following the rule,
we entered the bathhouse.
We suddenly experienced
realization
through the touch of water.
We did not wash off dirt,
did not wash the body.
We achieved peace of mind
and obtained
the state of no possession.
The aforementioned Buddha
then named me
Bhada Bhara,
saying,
you have experienced
subtle and clear touching
and attained Buddhahood
and retained it.
The answer to your question,
therefore,
is that touching
was the primary cause
of our realization.
And then finally,
the last one
was Kannon Bodhisattva,
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva,
who cites
the importance
in her case
of hearing,
listening to a sound.
The name Avalokiteshvara
means hearer
of the cries of the world.
So, there are a couple
of key things here
to look at
that have to do
with the nature
of the Bodhisattva
and the development
of a Bodhisattva.
And the first is,
since they didn't
wash off the dirt
and they didn't
wash their bodies,
what did they wash?
An important question.
And keep in mind
that the dirt
and the cleansing,
the idea of purification,
of taking away
defilements,
defiles
the whole
understanding
of the Dharma.
Because the
ten thousand things
are perfect and complete,
lacking nothing.
There's nothing
to purify.
The samsara
is in itself
nirvana.
Ingo says,
if you can understand
that at peace within
you realize
the absence
of anything existing,
then a thousand
or ten thousand
will no longer
be able to get near you.
As it is said,
absence of attainment
is true wisdom.
If there's something
which is attained,
this is just
the semblance
of wisdom.
And basically
what that is
is a restatement
of the Buddha's
original teaching.
All sentient beings
are perfect and complete,
lacking nothing.
That being the case,
then there's nothing
to attain.
There's nothing
that can be given.
It's already there.
It's a matter
of realizing
that which is there,
uncovering
that which is there.
So since
they didn't wash
off the dust
or the impurities
or the defilement
that existed
before their enlightenment,
in other words,
so it wasn't
washing away
defilements
that brought them
to enlightenment,
they didn't wash
their bodies.
What did they awaken to?
They said
the subtle feeling
reveals illumination
and we have achieved
the station
of Buddhahood.
Reveals means
to make apparent.
The subtle feeling
is already
right from the beginning
illumination.
Once we awaken
to the subtle feeling,
we see the universe
as a Buddha
sees the universe.
That is,
we are
indeed
none other
than a Buddha.
but
people
bathe all the time.
They also
wash in water.
They also
feel the water.
Why doesn't
everybody
that takes a bath
have an
enlightenment
experience?
Ango said,
they are all
confused and
obstructed
by the objects
of the senses.
They stick
to their skins
and cling
to their bones.
That is why
they can't wake up
immediately
then and there.
These gates
we call
the senses,
the six gates
of Zen.
Eye,
ear,
nose,
tongue,
body,
and mind.
And each
of those
six gates,
each of those
six organs
of perception
has an
object
of perception.
Ah.
Form for
eye,
sound for
ear,
smell for
nose,
and so on.
like these
bodhisattvas
talked about.
And it's
those
objects
and organs
of perception
and consciousness
that creates
what we call
reality.
But the
problem
is
what we
do
is we
become
fixed
or
attached
to the
object
of
perception.
In other
words,
we remain
separate
from the
object of
perception.
There is no
merging
with it.
That's a very
different way
of seeing.
One is
seeing through
intimacy,
the other is
seeing through
separation.
one is
seeing in
quotations,
the other
is seeing.
Dogen,
when he
talked about
seeing form
with the
whole body
and mind
and hearing
sounds with
the whole
body and
mind,
one understands
them intimately.
He's
talking about
unity,
where the
object of
perception,
the organ
of perception,
consciousness,
have all
merged.
When the
six senses
merge,
the gate
is entered.
And there
are so many
examples of
those kinds
of experiences
throughout the
history of
Buddhism as
being the
trigger,
teacher that
brings someone
to enlightenment,
you know,
woman's leg
getting caught
in the door
and another
teacher stubbing
his toe and
someone hearing
the sound of
a pebble
striking bamboo
or someone
receiving the
shout of a
teacher coming
to realization
through sound,
touch,
taste,
hearing,
feeling.
Always,
that's the
gate.
So,
Ango says,
people these
days feel
too,
but do
they perceive
its subtlety?
Subtle
feeling is
not ordinary
feeling and
feeler,
where contact
is considered
feeling and
separation is
not.
Do you get
that?
It's not like
that.
It's not like
ordinary feeling
and feeler,
where contact
with the thing
is considered
feeling and
separation is
not.
In other
words,
you need to
touch it,
to feel it.
It's not like
that.
That's not what
they're talking
about.
There's an
interesting truth
in that line,
a kind of
difficult to
grasp.
Its meaning
is very
subtle.
Subtle
when Rinzai
shouts
and Toksan
hits,
isn't this
subtle feeling?
Subtle
doesn't mean
soft,
doesn't mean
gentle
necessarily.
there's
something else
that he's
talking about
here.
He says,
although this
is so,
to realize
this,
you must be
extremely
piercing and
penetrating.
If you search
on your body,
what connection
is there?
If you are
extremely piercing
and penetrating,
then what need
is there to go
in and wash
or bathe?
Piercing and
penetrating is
usually,
usually it's
called seven
times piercing,
eight times
penetrating.
And basically
what that's
talking about,
it's also
similar to the
seven times
knock down,
eight times
get up.
And I know
Kim's going
to ask me,
how come
it's eight
times get up?
Since you
get knocked
down seven
times,
seven times
get up is
enough.
You're up
at the end
of it.
I don't
know.
It's the
same thing
here.
Seven times
piercing,
and the
piercing is
the sword
of the
teacher poking.
And
penetrating
is the
penetration
of the
truth
that the
student sees.
So each
time the
killing sword
is stuck
in,
a
realization
happens,
and there's
one more
realization
than there
is
pokes
of the
sword.
So that's
what
penetrating,
piercing,
and penetrating
means.
Now,
Dogen,
in referring
to the
nature of
a bodhisattva,
and basically
what this is
describing,
is the
life of a
bodhisattva.
and normally
bodhisattva is
regarded as
probably
the
best way
of understanding
what the
heart of
being a
bodhisattva
is,
is that
wisdom and
compassion
are both
functioning.
and the
statement
nirvana
was no
fixed abode
encapsulates
it perfectly.
This is a
state or a
condition in
which the
bodhisattva
abides neither
in the
birth and
death realm,
that is the
realm of
differentiation,
because of
wisdom,
so because
they've
realized the
nature of
self,
they're not
in the
realm of
birth and
death.
And at
the same
time,
they're not
in the
realm of
nirvana,
which is
this realm
of bliss,
Buddhist
heaven,
if you
will,
because of
compassion.
The
wisdom keeps
them from
falling into
birth and
death realm,
and the
compassion
keeps them
from being
in the
realm of
nirvana,
of enjoying
that wisdom
in a
self-centered
way.
So,
basically,
we can say
that the
life of a
bodhisattva is
the embodiment
of non-duality,
the embodiment
of the
non-duality
of wisdom
and compassion.
And in
general,
it's considered
that buddhas
and bodhisattvas
are different.
There's the
52 stages
of bodhisattva,
development of
bodhisattva,
that you find
throughout the
scriptures,
and the
last state
is that of
buddhahood.
So,
clearly,
bodhisattva,
in one way
of looking at
it,
is successive
steps to
buddhahood.
And, of
course,
that's one
way of
looking at
it.
There's
also a
way of
looking at
it all
as unified,
and that's
the way
Dogen looks
at it.
Dogen says,
what you
call
bodhisattvas
are all
buddhas.
Buddhas and
bodhisattvas are
not different
types of
being,
old and
young,
superior and
inferior,
don't have
any place
here.
even though
this
bodhisattva
and that
Buddha are
not two
beings,
nor the
self,
nor other,
don't bear
upon past,
present,
or future
to become
a Buddha.
He even
goes on to
say that
all bodhisattvas
are the
original
forebearers
of all
Buddhas,
that
bodhisattvas
are the
creators
of Buddhas.
And he
says,
all Buddhas
are the
original
mentors
of
bodhisattvas.
Kind of
interesting.
And then
another key
point
that Dogen
makes,
and this
is very
important in
appreciating
this koan
and appreciating
the koan
of our
sangha
that I
was talking
about,
that I
want to
come back
to.
And that
is that
when we
really
understand
the
fundamental
nature
of what
we call
Buddha
nature,
then we
realize
that being
Buddha
and becoming
Buddha
exists
simultaneously
and are not
two,
they're non-dual.
so the
process of
becoming
a Buddha
through
practice
and being
Buddha
realizing
are not
two separate
things.
The same
is true
of bodhisattva.
being and
becoming
are one.
The same
with Mu.
Becoming
Mu
and being
Mu
are non-dual.
Practice
and enlightenment
non-dual.
Wisdom
and compassion
non-dual.
Becoming
the process
and being
the goal
are one
reality.
So it's
not
that you
sit there
cross-legged
and wait
for heaven
to open up
and a bolt
of lightning
to hit you
in the back
of the head
and then
you're going
to rise
as a Buddha
and save
all sentient
beings.
Each
moment,
each pile
of shit
that we
encounter
is the
Buddha Dharma,
is the
teaching,
is the
sutra,
is the
manifestation
of our
life.
And if
we walk
away from
it
to a
pile of
stones
or to
something
else,
then
that pile
of shit
becomes
that which
the Buddha
Dharma
and Zen
does not
address.
we like
to blame.
People
practice
Zen
for years,
10 years,
20 years.
At the end
of that period
of time
they say,
you know,
I've been
practicing Zen
20 years
and my
life still
sucks.
There's
something
wrong with
Zen.
Right?
If you
say so.
Or,
we redesign
it to
suit our
needs.
Wow,
I don't
want to do
services,
services in
our firsts.
That was
for people
2,000 years
ago,
these primitive
minds that
needed that.
This is the
21st century
almost,
the age of
computers and
space travel.
We don't need
to do that.
That's gibberish.
Gathas,
things like
that.
Why do we
need to do
that?
Let's get
rid of
liturgy.
Let's get
rid of
this.
You don't
need robes.
You don't
need to
shave your
head.
You don't
need this.
You don't
need that.
So we
redesign it
to suit
our needs.
then when
it doesn't
work,
we say
something
wrong with
the Dharma.
It doesn't
work.
It was
okay in
China and
Japan,
but it
doesn't work
in America.
Americans are
different.
Westerners are
different.
When we
look at
the Bodhisattva
again in
that same
non-dual
way,
we can
consider it
from two
different
contexts.
One is
the person
of the
Bodhisattva
as an
object of
faith
and
devotion.
so
Kannan
Bodhisattva
becomes
the ideal
and we
chant it,
you know,
being one
with
Kansayom
Bosatsu.
We
marvel
at the
incredible
compassion
as her
ten thousand
hands and
eyes
respond to
the needs
of people
and say,
you know,
that's the
way to be.
And
believing that
and using
that as a
model,
having faith
in that,
it becomes
a way of
practicing
Kannan
Bodhisattva.
And that's
basically
the
way it's
dealt with
usually in
cultural
Buddhism.
But also,
the way
of the
Bodhisattva
becomes
a way
of living
one's life,
of being
the
Bodhisattva,
Kannan.
So,
on one
case,
we have
the
Bodhisattva
that responds
to sentient
beings
when we
recite the
name
Kansayom.
And we
have the
Bodhisattva
who observes
and liberates
sentient
beings.
when we
manifest it
as our
own life,
when we
practice it
as our
own life.
So,
the bottom
line then
is that
Avalokiteshvara
Bodhisattva
and all
of the
Bodhisattvas
are not
the object
of faith
but rather
the subject
of faith.
So,
we identify
with it,
we become
it,
we manifest
it,
we be
it.
and it's
kind of
interesting
that these
sixteen
Bodhisattvas
realize
themselves
simultaneously.
There's
something
being said
there too.
Awakening
to the
past by
hearing
sounds,
illuminating
the mind
by seeing
forms.
But why
did these
sixteen
Bodhisattvas
awaken at
the same
time?
Because
they practiced
together,
they experienced
together,
they awakened
together,
they understood
together.
there's
something
that's
being
said
there.
There was
no separation
to begin
with.
Now,
this
Bodhisattva
ideal,
keep in
mind that
the Bodhisattva
ideal is
the heart
of Mahayana
Buddhism.
And it's
no accident
that we
chant it
all the
time,
the four
vows,
the Bodhisattva
vows,
that it
constantly
comes up
in all
of the
Mahayana
sutras,
and that
it's always
pointing to
manifestation
in the
world
of those
ideals.
And the
essence
of that
ideal,
the bottom

summation
of the
Bodhisattva
ideal,
is of course
great compassion.
And the
relationship
between wisdom
and compassion
is simply
that one
is the
realization
and the
other is
the
activity.
non-duality
of wisdom
and compassion
is the
non-duality
of all
of the
opposites
of the
self
and non-self,
sentient
and insentient,
buddhist and
sentient beings,
men and
women,
enlightenment
and delusion,
heaven and
hell,
good and
bad.
The way
of the
Bodhisattva
is,
I am
thus,
you are
thus.
It's the
identity of
I and
you in
thusness,
in activity,
this momentness.
it's
the heart
of the
matter
of what
Dogen
means when
he says
when a
person studies
themselves
thoroughly
and
understands
themselves
thoroughly,
they
understand
others
thoroughly
as well
and as
a result
casts off
self
and other.
It doesn't
mean
that that's
a blank
void.
It means
that this
Bodhisattva
can manifest
according to
the circumstances
because
of that
emptiness,
because
there is
no fixed
form
to be
called
I
and
you.
realizing
that,
with
realizing
that
comes
the
responsibility
to all
life
and
non-life,
to all
things.
This
self and
other
non-duality
where
self,
where
other
sentient
beings,
other
people,
inanimate
things,
the mountains
and rivers,
our
friends,
our
family,
our
loved
ones,
and our
most
hated
ones.
That
non-duality
Dogen
expressed
in terms
of the
four
virtues
of the
bodhisattva.
And the
first of
those is
giving.
The
second is
loving
speech.
The
third is
service for
the welfare
of all
beings.
This
means
sentient
and
insentient.
And the
fourth is
identity
with
others.
And what
I'd like to
do tomorrow
is to
continue
with this
koan,
its
verse
and
these
four
virtues
of
Dogen,
most
importantly
with
regard to
our own
sangha
and our
practice.
In the
meantime,
you can
sit with
a little
bit of
this.
