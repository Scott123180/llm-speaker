The Zen teachings of Master Hakuin, Hakuin's concentration in activity,
a pointer. Those who regard the secular as a hindrance to the sacred only know that in the secular nothing is sacred. What they have not yet realized is that in sacredness nothing is secular.
The main case. The great Master Hakuin taught, concentration in the midst of activity excels concentration in stillness by a hundred, a thousand, or even a hundred million times.
A verse. When an ordinary person knows it, they are a sage. When a sage sees it, they are an ordinary person.
As many of you know, we're in our second month of Ango, the 90-day intensive training period that we do each, twice a year, every fall and every spring.
And the topic, the theme of this Ango, has been the mystical teachings.
And we've been exploring the mystical teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Zen.
This particular weekend, we have Professor Buswell with us, who is conducting classes on the mystical teachings of Zen.
We also have a workshop called Zen Brush that's being conducted by Sensei Tanahishi on Zen calligraphy, Zen brush work.
And so, what I'm trying to do with today's talk is kind of show a little bit of a relationship between these two events that are simultaneously taking place.
And this particular statement of Hakuin that I've taken up as a koan comes from Kaz's book, Penetrating Laughter.
It's one of the plates in there.
And it's a poem that's on the piece of calligraphy.
It's a piece of calligraphy that has this statement on it.
And Hakuin, aside from being a very extraordinary Zen master, was also a very special artist and poet.
And as is in the tradition of Zen, much of the teaching is transmitted through poetry, through art.
So, it's not unusual for a Zen teacher.
For example, my teacher Son Roshi, my first teacher, always used calligraphy and paintings as a way of teaching.
So, he would, you know, sometimes run off a piece of calligraphy or a painting and give it to you.
I mean, basically what it was, was a koan.
So, it was some very profound statement regarding the Dharma.
And Hakuin was like that.
Many of the masters throughout history, both in Japan and in China, used that style, that technique of teaching.
Hakuin himself made a comment on this.
And he says,
Zen practitioners of olden times would respond wholeheartedly to the drums that announced the work period for hauling rocks or carrying earth, water, firewood, and vegetables, in order to seek attainment in the midst of activity.
This being so, Yakujo said,
A day of no work, a day of no eating.
This is called concentration in the midst of activity, or unceasing Zazen.
Dogen called it ceaseless practice.
And he goes on to say, of course, no attainer of wisdom has completed the Buddha way without practicing concentration in Zazen.
And so, it should not be neglected.
But distinguished practitioners of Zen practice the supreme meditation that goes beyond form and principle.
That is, in either form or emptiness.
And what is that?
What is that practice?
What kind of Zazen is that?
In his calligraphy, it's a very interesting piece of calligraphy, he uses the character Chu, which is kind of a rectangle with a line drawn through the center of it.
And that's the character for midst.
Or, as Akaz said in his commentary on this, it also might mean hit the mark.
And when he wrote it, he did it very, very bold, and he made this bold stroke down the whole center of the scroll,
so it's dominated by in the midst, or hit the mark, or as we would say, right on.
So, that's the basic bold stroke.
And then on both sides of that is the little poem.
Concentration in the midst of activity excels concentration and stillness by a hundred, a thousand, or even a hundred million times.
And basically, in the midst is, you've got to do with intimacy, it's the word that I like to use to describe that.
Intimacy means the whole body and mind.
True intimacy in the midst of activity is the activity itself.
There's no separation.
Enlightenment is not an activity that takes place in the world.
Enlightenment is the activity of the world itself.
And that's the thing we need to see.
Now, he says, concentration in the midst of activity excels concentration and stillness.
And concentration has all kinds of interpretations of what that means.
Different people will see it differently.
We have the concentration that every artist experiences, every person that's really involved in their work or absorbed in their work.
And you see it with a car mechanic, an artist, a performer, bricklayer, a parent and a child.
And that absorption is a little bit different than what I'm speaking of when I say intimacy.
When I use the word intimacy, I'm talking about whole body and mind intimacy.
I'm talking about no separation.
There's a difference of being captured by something where the mind is arrested.
You know, you're walking down the street and somebody's standing on a ledge five stories high saying they're going to jump.
And suddenly you're totally captured by that scene.
In a sense, we can call that a kind of concentration.
It happens, you go to a movie.
And if it's a good one, it's over like that before you realize it.
You're sorry it happened so fast, but actually it was a two-hour long movie.
That's a little different than what I'm talking about.
And of course it does happen.
Intimacy I'm speaking of does happen in everyday occasions.
All of us at one time or another experience this.
Minor White used to say, every artist at some time in their life walks on water.
And that walking on water is that intimacy.
And in that intimacy, the brush paints by itself.
The camera photographs by itself.
The arrow shoots itself.
The self is forgotten.
The whole body and mind is the brush.
The whole body and mind is the process.
And that's what Master Dogen was speaking of when he said,
Seeing form with the whole body and mind.
Hearing sound with the whole body and mind.
One understands them intimately.
That intimately, that Dogen says, is enlightenment itself.
It's the direct experience of no separation.
It's the direct experience of body and mind falling away.
It's the whole body and mind and body and mind falling away.
They're essentially the same thing.
A concentration in the midst of activity, in a sense, is Zazen.
This is what he's speaking of.
And as I've mentioned many times before, again and again I mention it.
And somehow, so many things we say over and over and over again.
I mean, I feel like, even though I do hundreds of talks each year,
basically it's the same talk.
I'm saying the same thing all the time.
Same thing with the sutras.
You read the sutras, and over and over again, page after page,
they're saying basically the same thing.
How it's presented is slightly different,
but the truth of what's being presented is repeated again and again and again.
And sometimes it takes that kind of repetition before it finally sinks in.
So this Zazen that Hakuin is talking about,
we need to understand that it's not meditation.
It's not contemplation.
It's not introspection.
It's not quieting the mind.
It's not mindfulness.
It's not empty mind.
It's not focusing the mind.
It has nothing to do with mudras, mantras, mandalas.
The Zazen that Hakuin speaks of,
the Zazen that I'm speaking of,
that Dogen speaks of,
is sitting Zen, one aspect of Zen.
There's also walking Zen,
working Zen, laughing Zen, crying Zen.
And the Zen that we speak of is a way of using your mind
and living your life and doing it with other people.
Zazen is enlightenment itself,
not a process for arriving at enlightenment.
The Buddha nature is the nature of all sentient beings.
And the nature of all sentient beings is the Buddha nature.
And that's why you end up with the dilemma
or a koan, such as the koan of Kasyo Buddha.
Monk asks,
Master Sejo of Koyo,
Kasyo Buddha did Zazen on the Bodhisit for ten kalpas.
The Buddha dharma was not manifested,
nor did he attain Buddhahood.
Why was it?
The Master answered,
Your question is splendid indeed.
The monk persisted.
He did Zazen on the Bodhisit.
Why didn't he attain Buddhahood?
The Master replied,
Because he did not attain Buddhahood.
Why is it?
Kasyo Buddha is one of the past seven Buddhas.
Ten kalpas.
You know, a kalpa is eons,
an extraordinary length of time.
For ten kalpas,
he did Zazen,
and he didn't attain it.
Why is that?
Mumman in his poem said,
Rather than give the body relief,
give relief to the mind.
When the mind is at peace,
the body is not to stress.
If body and mind are both set free,
why must the holy saint become a lord?
Right there in that last line.
Mumman feeds it to us.
Why must the holy saint become a lord?
It can't be attained.
It can't be given.
It can't be received.
It never has been transmitted.
And why do we call it mind-to-mind transmission?
Because it is mind-to-mind,
Buddha-to-Buddha.
Only a Buddha can transmit,
and only a Buddha can receive.
And that's the beautiful truth
of this incredible Dharma.
Dharma.
And it was the very first words
out of Shakyamuni's mouth
upon his own realization.
Isn't it incredible?
All sentient beings of the Buddha-nature.
All sentient beings,
each one of us,
perfect and complete,
lacking nothing.
That's the truth of this Dharma.
But of course,
unless we realize it,
we can't manifest it.
It doesn't function.
And that realization
makes it your own.
And a couple of people
sitting in on one of the lectures,
particularly the newer students here,
were shocked.
to find out
that the lineage
of mind-to-mind transmission
has brakes in it.
In actual fact,
those of you who have been here long enough
must
appreciate the fact
that just about every scholar
that's given a talk here
over the past ten years
has mentioned that fact.
And again and again,
I mention it in my talks.
There's no evidence that
Buddha held up a flower
on vulture peaks
and that Marakai Shapa smiled
or that Bodhi Dharma
even existed.
In our own lineage,
the Soto lineage,
there's around the 16th ancestor
after Tozan.
The teacher had transmitted the Dharma
but the people he transmitted it to
had died
before transmitting it to anybody else.
And he was very, very old
and he knew that he
wasn't going to live long enough
to train anybody.
So he had a friend,
a Rinzai monk
and he said,
will you please
wait
until someone
comes along
that has realized it,
whose eye is open
and pass on my lineage
to them.
He said he would do it.
And so that next generation
was actually
approved by a Rinzai monk
outside of the
Soto lineage.
And then again,
who knows,
in early days
of Buddhism
in Japan
what happened
with the lineages.
So why then?
Why do we call it
mind-to-mind transmission?
And it's kind of interesting,
you know,
I've often said that
if suddenly
it's announced
great discovery,
archaeologists
doing some studies
in India
discover
Buddha never existed.
It's a hoax
created by the Chinese
in order to
justify
their
ancestral need
to have a lineage.
What would that mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean to you?
Shall we close up shop?
Everybody go home?
We'll turn the
monastery into
a
bed and breakfast.
The existence
of Shakti Muni Buddha
doesn't have a
damn thing
to do
with my life
and my practice.
My life
and my practice
is verified
by the practice.
my teacher
gave me
nothing
absolutely
nothing
and it's for that
reason
that I'm
deeply grateful
to him.
If he had
given me something
he'd have been
a charlatan
and when you run up
against the teacher
who has got
something to give you
run for your life
because you're
dealing with
a charlatan
we lack
nothing
not a single
one of us
lacks a single
thing
that's the truth
that was
transmitted
mind to mind
and if it's
not
realized
by yourself
and if you
don't empower
yourself
and if you
don't verify
it yourself
it doesn't
exist
nobody can
give it to you
all we can
do is point
all we can
do is talk
about it
mind to mind
transmission
is not
linear
it's not
sequential
in fact
even on
the
on the
kichimiyaku
we show
it as a
circle
when you
take those
those lines
and
straighten it
out
you realize
it's a
circle
after your
name
at the
end of
that blood
lineage
chart
the line
continues
back
to the
Buddha
actually
back
to the
Dharmakaya
where the
whole thing
starts from
and it's
really a
circle
but even
a circle
doesn't quite
describe it
in a circle
you can even
think of it
in terms of
being linear
and sequential
we talked
about for
example
Maitreya
Buddha
you know
that Maitreya
the Buddha
of the future
will appear
after the
decline of
Buddhism
which was
predicted by
the Buddha
Buddha
predicted that
after a
certain period
of time
there would
be the
beginning of
a decline
that's the
period we're
in right
now
of Buddhism
and that
decline would
be complete
when there
were no
longer any
more enlightened
beings
on the face
of the
earth
and that
there were
no longer
any of
the sutras
all the
sutras
had been
destroyed
and that
there was
no one
on the face
of the
earth
that could
recite
even a
single line
of a
sutra
at that
point
the demise
of Buddhism
would be
complete
and Maitreya
Buddha
would appear
there might
be a period
of thousands
of years
of no
Buddhism
and suddenly
Maitreya
Buddha
would appear
well when
Maitreya
Buddha
appears
it will
be a
direct
mind-to-mind
transmission
from teacher
to student
you see
when you
realize
yourself
you
transmit
to the
Buddha
Buddha
doesn't
transmit
to you
when you
realize
yourself
you
actualize
the life
of all
the Buddhas
and ancestors
past
present
and future
doesn't
make sense
does it
of course
it doesn't
make sense
we're talking
about mysticism
mysticism
doesn't make
sense
it's a
mystery
mysticism
is beyond
the senses
or better
better way
of even
saying that
it's a
total
merging
with the
senses
it can't
be verified
by objective
means
there are a lot
of things
that don't
make sense
blue mountain
walking
doesn't
make sense
walking
forward
and walking
backward
walking
over water
doesn't
compute
mountain
flowing
doesn't
make sense
stone
woman
giving
birth
to a
child
in the
night
doesn't
make
sense
it's
dark
to the
mind
that's
what
whoever
the hell
it was
if it
wasn't
bodhidharma
meant
when he
said
beyond
words
and
letters
direct
pointing
to the
human
mind
and the
realization
of
buddhahood
it's
got nothing
to do
with the
words
and ideas
that describe
reality
it's the
direct
experience
of the
reality
itself
to make
it your
own
dark
to the
mind
but
radiant
to the
heart
it can
be
realized
but it
can't
be known
and
believing
doesn't
reach it
so
of course
it doesn't
make sense
that's why
zazen is so
important
well what does
it all mean
then
you know
you're part
of zen
zen is a
ancestral
kind of
lineage
goes directly
from teacher
to student
look at
our practice
here on this
mountain
is that
what it
is
look at
the eight
areas
of practice
you know
there are
different ways
of the
dharma
being taught
some
go to
the teachings
of the
sutras
study the
sutras
study the
words
study the
ideas
that's what
we call
academic
study
one of
the eight
areas
of training
here
some of
them just
rely on
zazen
alone
that's what
we call
zazen
one of the
eight areas
of practice
some are
totally involved
in the
liturgy
that's what
we call
liturgy
one of the
eight areas
of practice
some the
vinaya
that's what
we call
the precepts
one of the
eight areas
of practice
some of
them direct
face to
face
that's what
we call
direct
pointing
one of the
eight areas
of practice. And in addition
there's work practice, there's
art practice, and there's body practice.
And the whole thing
together
is there so that
you can verify
for yourself
the life of the Buddha.
So that you can
in your own life
give life to the Buddha.
We tend to look
for guarantees.
There are no guarantees.
There's no guarantee
that because someone has received
the transmission from their teacher
that they're realized. Their teacher
may be a shithead, and that's what's
transmitted one shithead to another.
And there's no way of knowing
it, except through your
own experience of it.
Someone may never have received
the transmission
and be very enlightened,
very deeply enlightened.
Shakyamuni Buddha
didn't have a teacher.
He wasn't even a Buddhist.
he did it.
And again and again,
outside of Buddhism,
John of the Cross,
Teresa of Avila,
the sixth patriarch.
Wasn't
even literate.
Wasn't a monk.
and to Buddha
all,
he was a southerner.
That was the worst part of it.
His teacher said,
you southern monkeys
don't have the Buddha nature.
And why?
Why do we speak
of mind-to-mind transmission?
Why do we have
all these things?
You know,
it was kind of interesting
to me,
teaching never stops.
Learning never stops.
What we did
this past weekend
was something
that I have resisted
for a long time.
Kind of a
great
cosmic
Dharma
circus.
You know,
mountain seat ceremony.
And I never appreciated
its value.
I basically
really did it
because I trusted
my teacher.
He said,
do it.
Same thing with
Zuisei going to Japan.
To me,
the most
significant
aspect of the
teacher-student
relationship
was
in the
transmission ceremony
which is done
privately
at midnight
with one witness
and it's not even
announced.
And it's in that
ceremony
that the parent
becomes the child
and the child
becomes the parent.
To me,
that was
the completion
of the circle.
But then following that,
there was this
long
trip
to Japan,
very expensive,
to do this ceremony
at the two main
temples in Japan.
I didn't want to do it.
I didn't want to spend
the money.
I didn't want to go
through the whole ritual.
My teacher wanted me
to do it.
I asked my board
should I do it
and they wanted me
to do it.
They said do it.
That it's important.
It's important to them
and it's important
to the generations
that follow.
And I did it.
And I learned.
I learned something
by doing it.
And the same
with this
mountain seat ceremony.
I really didn't want
to do it.
It's expensive.
It's a lot of
hullabaloo.
It's complicated.
It takes us away
from our daily practice.
But I did it.
And I was stunned.
I was absolutely stunned
by the reaction
of people to that.
I had no idea
that it could affect
people so deeply.
Not only the Sangha,
but people who knew
nothing about Buddhism.
You know,
I had many friends
from years ago
that came to that ceremony.
And after the ceremony
that night,
we sat in the duchess sand
and talked about it.
And I listened to them.
And I was stunned
by what
it was communicating.
All it is
is upaya.
Skillful means.
The whole thing
is upaya.
Skillful means.
Everything the Buddha
ever said
or did
was upaya.
Skillful means.
Zazen is upaya.
Face-to-face teaching.
Liturgy.
Art practice.
Body practice.
Study.
The sutras.
Chanting.
Bowing.
All of it
is upaya.
Skillful means.
To get us
to realize
that which is
already there.
That which has
always been there.
That which cannot
be given
and cannot
be received.
That's the
incredible
truth.
of the storm.
It's so simple.
So direct.
So easy to miss.
And it doesn't
make sense.
That's why
it's so beautiful.
Doesn't make sense.
The brush
painting by itself
doesn't make sense.
Intimacy
doesn't make sense.
Because there's
no knower
or thing
to be known
anymore
in intimacy.
There's no
reflection.
You see.
If you call it
a stick
you miss it.
Those are the words
that describe it.
That's not what it is.
That's not what
it's about.
If you say
it's not a stick
you deny it.
That misses it.
Then what is it?
It's the same
with the sacred
and the secular.
Those who regard
the secular
as a hindrance
to enlightenment
only understand
that in the secular
nothing is sacred.
But they haven't
yet understood
that in sacredness
nothing is secular.
the only thing
that separates us
from the Buddha
or the ten thousand
things
is an idea.
An idea
of the self.
and when an
ordinary person
realizes that truth
they're a sage
and when a sage
sees it
they're an ordinary
person.
people
and
