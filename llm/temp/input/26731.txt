The Gateless Gate
Case 47
Tosotsu's Three Barriers
Master Tosotsu made three barriers
to test his monks
to inquire after truth
groping your way through the underbrush
is for the purpose of seeing into your nature
hear now
where is your nature, venerable monk
if you realize your own nature
you are certainly free from life and death
when your eyes are closed
how can you be free from life and death
if you are free from life and death
you know where you will go
when the four elements are decomposed
where do you go
Master Mumman's commentary
if you can rightly give three turning words here
you will be the master wherever you may be
and live up to the Dharma
no matter how varied the circumstances
if however you are unable to give them
I warn you
you'll get tired of food that you have bolted
and well-chewed food keeps hunger away
Master Mumman's poem
this one instant
as it is
is an infinite number of kalpas
an infinite number of kalpas
are at the same time
this one instant
if you see into this fact
if you see into this fact
the true self
which is seeing
has been seen into
Buddha's
own search
his own religious quest
began with the question of life and death
a student's entry into training here
at Zen Mountain Monastery
is based on
the question of life and death
as the students stand in that Gaitan
asking permission to enter
they say
I come here realizing
the question of life and death
is a vital matter
I wish to enter training in this monastery
and then they enter
each evening
at the end of the day's sitting
the Jikido
chants the evening gatha
let me respectfully remind you
life and death
is a vital matter
time passes swiftly
and opportunity is lost
each of us should strive
to awaken
awaken
take heed
do not squander
your life
so clearly
that question
of life and death
is a fundamental matter
that must be addressed
by this practice
a question
who are you
who are you
is that first question
that
Tosotsu asked
here now
where is your nature
venerable monk
what is your true nature
what is your original face
that's the same question
is who are you
what is truth
where do you come from
where will you go
what is reality
what is life
and what is death
then in a sense
that first question
here now
where is your true nature
venerable monk
to have resolved
that question
clearly
is to have resolved
all three of them
clearly
and this koan
is one of
very famous
koans
in Rinzai school
it's used
as one of the
final koans
toward the end
of training
and the whole point
of the person's
training
is to see
their true nature
it's what we call
kensho
or realization
and at the end
of the training
this teacher
asks his monk
right now
show me
where is this
true nature
and if you've
seen the true
nature
then you
are certainly
free from
life and death
when you're
breathing your
last breath
how can you
be free
of life and
death
and if you
are free
of life and
death
then you
clearly know
where you
will go
when the
four elements
decompose
where do you
go
the four elements
and this
koan goes
back
to the year
1000
and at that
time they
believed that
everything was
composed of
these four
elements
and we can
say when all
of your cells
and atoms
and molecules
have completely
disintegrated
then where
are you
where is
your true
nature
it's the
same question
what is
life
what is
it that's
born
we call
life the
unborn in
buddhism
what does
that mean
life is
the unborn
what is
death
what is
it that
dies
we say
that death
is the
unextinguished
in buddhism
what does
that mean
there are
all kinds
of ways
religion
of necessity
must deal
with these
questions
and different
religions
deal with
them quite
differently
particularly
quite differently
than buddhism
does
in buddhism
there is no
soul
we talked
about that
several times
during this
weekend
what is
the self
we say
to study
the buddha
way is
to study
the self
and to
study
the self
is to
forget
the self
and what
is the
self
well for
most of
us the
self is
this skin
bag
everything
inside the
skin bag
is me
and everything
outside is
the rest
of the
universe
that's the
conclusion
we come
to very
early on
in life
and immediately
everything we
need and
want and
desire is
outside
and that
separation
is the
first premise
and everything
follows
I mentioned
earlier
you ask
yourself the
question
what is
the self
what you
come up
with is a
list of
aggregates
it's my
body
my mind
my thoughts
my feelings
my ideas
those are
aggregates
what's the
self
don't evade
the question
what's a
room
walls
ceiling
floor
windows
doors
those are
aggregates
what's
roomness
itself
and western
philosophy
says you
take the
aggregates
away and
what you've
got is an
essence
essence of a
room
essence of a
chair
essence of a
person
and the
essence of a
person is a
soul
and that's
the judeo
christian
way of
seeing it
but it's
not the
buddhist
way of
seeing it
in buddhism
when you
remove the
aggregates
what remains
is nothing
vast
emptiness
and it's
because
of that
emptiness
that the
ten thousand
things exist
we take
the self
to be
who we
are
the self
is an
idea
from a
buddhist
point of
view
that's
what's
realized
that's
what it
means
to study
the self
is to
forget
the self
and when
the self
is forgotten
what remains
what happens
to you
what is
it that's
left
when there's
no longer
a self
everything
the whole
phenomenal
universe
past
present
and future
it's just
that there's
no longer
an idea
that separates
you from
that
so I
ask you
again
what is
it that's
born
what is
it that
dies
that
question
what is
life
is something
that in my
own life
always
plagued me
very very
young
ten
twelve
thirteen
fourteen
years old
I was very
interested in
science
very interested
astronomy
and biology
and I
wanted to
know
what is
it that's
life
when you
look at
something
that's
one moment
alive
and the
next
moment
dead
everything
is still
intact
and yet
we say
it's dead
but we say
it's alive
there are
miracles
both of
them
the miracle
of life
and the
miracle
of death
those
questions
that I
had
led me
to
finally
go into
science
and one
of my
major
preoccupations
during
seventeen
years of
doing
scientific
research
was
about
the
origin
of life
and it's
kind of
interesting
that
I've
always
regarded
Einstein's
theory of
relativity
as a
religious
experience
equal
to that
of any
saint
of any
Buddha
kind of
almost a
revelation
E equals
MC
square
what an
extraordinary
statement
that energy
and mass
are
interconvertible
there's a
dynamic
relationship
that exists
between those
two
it's marvelous
still incomplete
but marvelous
you can
imagine
a universe
that's just
energy
nothing else
when there's
just energy
there's no
way to know
that
we measure
energy
by its
interaction
on matter
it's a
relativistic
thing
to know
that it's
present
but there's
just energy
there's
nothing
there
and yet
that energy
has the
potential
to manifest
itself
as mass
E
equals
M
mass
times the
speed of
light
squared
that's the
relationship
between the
two
so energy
can become
mass
mass can
become
energy
it's the
whole
basis of
atomic
energy
a small
amount
of matter
this
tremendous
force
of energy
is produced
so if you've
got a universe
that's just
energy
ultimately
you're going
to have
mass
you're going
to have
atoms
molecules
proteins
I mean
the minute
you create
molecules
they have
inherent
characteristics
they want
to couple
they want
to form
if the
conditions
are right
they come
together
they come
together
in very
specific
ways
there are
certain
affinities
so you
can see
this
evolution
beginning to
take place
the moment
you've got
energy
you're going
to have
mass
the moment
you have
mass
it's
inevitable
that life
has got
to happen
those molecules
will arrange
themselves
some
beautiful
work has
been done
on that
subject
many years
ago
30 years
ago
showing
that if
you put
together
very simple
atoms in a
reducing
atmosphere
that you can
produce amino
acids
by electrical
bombardment
like lightning
storms
and so
here's this
huge
universe
of particles
and the
minute those
particles
appear
they begin
to coalesce
and attract
each other
and the
closer they
come
the more
compact they
come
the more
energy is
compacted
and then
they burst
and explode
and some
of these
particles
flying into
the cooler
parts of
outer space
begin to
cool down
they find
themselves
orbiting
around a
central mass
the sun
and as
they cool
down
a crust
forms on
the surface
and as
that cooling
continues
towards the
center
condensation
vapors of
ammonia and
so on
can form
on the
surface
and then
the clouds
part and
light comes
energy
and these
atoms and
molecules begin
to come
together and
primitive forms
of life
happen
and time
evolves and
more and more
complex forms
of life
and one day
one of them
crawls out of the
soup up onto
dry land and
the evolution
continues
life
what a marvelous
gift
death
what a marvelous
gift
we can think of
all of this in
terms of heaven
and hell
we can think of
life and death
in terms of
reincarnation
hundreds of
different ways
of doing it
but from the
point of view
of Buddhism
from the
point of view
of Zen
what is the
self
I had a
teacher
that during
Zazen
used to go
up and down
the aisles
saying
die
die on
your pillow
when you
die once
you can
never die
again
I thought
he was
insane
during those
days
but I came
through the
years to
understand what
he was
talking about
the death
of the
ego
the death
of the
idea
that
encapsulates
us
in this
bag of
skin
that we
call
me
I
self
ego
I mean
if you look
at it
just look
at it
you know
who you
are
you're the
same bag
of skin
that you
were when
you were
nine months
old
of course
not
you're
constantly
changing
you're the
same bag
of skin
now that
you'll be
when you're
80
of course
not
you're
constantly
changing
five years
ago
who you
were
every
molecule
every atom
that was
there five
years ago
was no
longer in
your body
and that's
even
scientifically
verifiable
we're in
a constant
state
of equilibrium
with our
environment
the same
air we
breathe
today
is the
air that
Buddha
was breathing
and Jesus
was breathing
we
assimilate
this
great
earth
we take
into our
bodies
its
nourishment
the
water
the
minerals
the
elements
and we
assimilate
it
and we
also
produce
a waste
that returns
to the
great
earth
I've told
many of
you about
that little
cartoon
that we
were going
to do
in LA
in LA
they used
to have
this
evening
sermonette
and they
always had
a minister
a rabbi
or a priest
and we
figured the
Buddhists
should be
given a
break
there are
a lot
of Buddhists
in LA
so we
went to
the radio
to the
television
station
and said
you know
how about
giving us
a chance
and they
were going
to do
it
so we
decided
we didn't
want to
add another
talking head
you know
that was
going to
say something
very
spiritual
instead
we started
working on
this cartoon
called
impermanence
and
I wish
we had
finished it
we had
never
finished it
it would
be a
great
cartoon
maybe
someday
but this
cartoon
starts with
an egg
and a
sperm
in vast
space
and
suddenly
they find
each other
these two
things
and when
they touch
bing
sound
and light
and suddenly
the reproduction
starts
and this
thing becomes
more and more
complex
and
becomes an
embryo
becomes a
fetus
and then the
next thing
you know
it's moving
it's moving
through time
and space
the umbilical
called
falls away
and it's
crawling along
on the ground
and after a while
it gets up
on two feet
and it's
kind of
wobbly
and teetering
and there
it goes
and as it
walks
the walk
becomes
this is all
in like a
five minute
cartoon
as it
walks
the walk
becomes
stronger
the body
becomes stronger
it begins to
fill out
and the walk
becomes kind
of a stride
and the body
becomes very
beautiful
and round
and it keeps
striding through
time and space
and while this
whole thing
is going on
there's this
huge cornucopia
of life
that's pouring
food
life
into one end
of this
creature
that's walking
there are
cows and
cabbages
and apples
and all sorts
of things
pouring into it
and in its
wake
there's waste
that's being
deposited
so there's a
wake behind it
I actually
calculated it
once
it comes out
to about
16 tons
by the time
you're about
40 years old
of waste
that you've
produced
and I often
ask the
questions
who are you
the 16 tons
or the
150 or
80 pounds
that you
carry around
inside the
skin bag
it's an
interesting
question
but anyway
you continue
through time
and space
and
gradually
the process
begins to
reverse itself
the stride
becomes a
little slower
a little
more steady
and the
body
becomes
a little
smaller
and bends
over a little
bit
the walk
becomes slower
and bending
over is a
little bit
more
and gradually
we begin to
kind of
shrivel up
and walk
very very
very slowly
it's very
difficult to
walk
and then
all of a
sudden
bing
it's gone
in permanence
who are you
all that
cornucopia
that came
into you
all of that
waste that
went out of
you
all of the
different forms
of that skin
bag as it
changed through
time and
space
none of it
some of it
all of it
who are you
what does it
mean to see
into one's
own nature
we talk about
the ground
of being
underneath
all of the
layers of
conditioning
and all of us
are conditioned
conditioned by
our parents
and by our
teachers
conditioned by
our culture
and by our
nation
conditioned by
our education
and by our
peers
programmed
programmed to
view ourselves
in the universe
in a particular
way
and we
respond by
the time
we're adults
like robots
to circumstances
we do what
we should do
or supposed
to do
well what
practice is
about
what realization
is about
is getting
underneath
all of that
program
peeling it
back
layer by
layer
getting to
that
ground
of being
realizing
that ground
of being
because underneath
all of that
stuff
is a person
and realizing
that
and learning
to live
one's life
out of that
realization
not what
you're told
or not what
you should
believe
or not what
I say
or what
the Buddha
said
or anybody
else said
but out
of your
own
direct
and immediate
experience
and it is
that
an experience
it has
nothing to do
with the words
and ideas
that describe it
it's the reality
itself
it has
nothing to do
with understanding
it has
nothing to do
with believing
it's an experience
and that experience
is transformative
once having
realized it
there's no way
that you can
live your life
in the old way
your whole way
of perceiving
yourself
and the universe
is completely
transformed
that's what
it means
to see
one's true nature
and then
it becomes
clear
why we say
life is the
unborn
in birth
not a single
atom is added
and you see
why we say
death is the
unextinguished
in death
not one
single
particle
is lost
then what
is it
and how
do you
free yourself
from it
there are
all kinds
of wonderful
intellectual
explanations
for true
nature
that
which
you're born
with
the true
self
that's revealed
here and
now
that penetrates
the three worlds
of past
present
and future
that pervades
the whole
universe
that it's only
this formless
self
restricted by
nothing
that's neither
alive nor
dead
wonderful
explanations
but that
doesn't cut it
don't tell me
show me
show me
if you see
your true
nature
show me
your true
nature
if you're
clear
on what
happens
when you're
breathing
your last
breath
and how
to be
free
of life
and death
then
don't tell
me
show me
if you're
clear that
having died
and the four
elements
completely
decompose
where you
will go
then show
me
don't tell
me
this question
of life
and death
unfortunately
we don't
deal with
it
we don't
deal with
it until
the end
has come
upon us
then we
begin to
look at
it
it's
important
to resolve
that early
because it
determines
almost everything
we do
in the way
we combust
our lives
in the way
we relate
in the way
we understand
ourselves
and others
and then
when finally
it comes
upon us
we end
up going
through
a whole
syndrome
Kubler-Ross
what's her
first name
Elizabeth
Kubler-Ross
talked about
it in terms
of these
five stages
that people
go through
in death
and dying
but in
actual
fact
not only
do we
go through
those five
stages
in death
and dying
we go
through
those five
stages
with almost
any kind
of a loss
loss of a
marriage
even loss
of a wallet
for God's
sakes
we tend to
go through
this whole
thing
it's a lot
less
traumatic
but it's
usually
there
and the
first of
those
is denial
didn't
happen
isolation
feeling very
very much
alone
that in the
whole universe
you're the
only one
that this
happened to
there's no
sense of
nourishment
from anything
or anyone
and that
denial
seems to
be a
standard
way
that we
deal with
things that
we don't
want to
deal with
it's not
there
pretend that
we suppress
it and a
lot of
people use
zazen to
do exactly
that
that's not
zazen
that's
suppression
and then
sooner or
later it
goes from
that stage
to anger
usually the
anger involves
blaming
I mean most
marriages get
to that
you know these
two people are
in love and
the birds are
flying and
everything is
wonderful and
a few years
later they
hate each
other I
mean they
say things
about each
other that
are unbelievable
in order to
justify the
separation
they may
just simply
have grown
apart but
somehow anger
and hatred
needs to
happen in
order for the
separation to
take place and
sometimes that
anger is
directed toward
oneself
you blame
yourself
someone is
lost someone
has passed
on
what if I
had only done
such and such
that wouldn't
have happened
five years
ago if I
had said
such and
such it
wouldn't have
happened
if I had
done this
it's all my
fault
that's blaming
even when you
blaming yourself
it's not the
same as taking
responsibility
taking responsibility
is intimate
blaming is
separateness
and then
the third
stage that she
talks about is
bargaining
how can I
change it
what can I
do what can
I give
the prayer of
petition
is a big
thing at that
time you
know
God do this
for me God
do that for
me I need
I want
Buddhism we
don't have
prayers
the whole
catastrophe is
in your
hands
you need to
empower yourself
and the way
you empower
yourself is
through
Zazen
and then
comes
depression
that usually
follows
everything seems
hopeless now
and a deep
depression begins
to set in
and then
finally
acceptance
or letting
go and
usually
with that
acceptance or
letting go
or sometime
in this
process
grief
needs to
happen
grief
needs to be
expressed
that's another
thing we tend
to suppress
we don't want
to deal with
it and I'm
talking about
all kinds of
loss
a relationship
ends
a marriage
ends
a death
happens
there's always
grief
but we tend
to suppress it
and push it
out of the way
well it doesn't
go away
it just becomes
more of the
baggage that you
carry with you
and sooner or
later I have
people doing
seshin
who suddenly
are dealing
with something
that happened
thirty years
ago
that was
never completed
you need to
complete the
cycle
that's the
importance of
a memorial
service
that's the
importance of
a funeral
service
that's what
the liturgy
is about
it's about
rites of
passage
birth
death
and all of
the rites of
passage
that are part
of human
existence
you can't
ignore them
you need to
be
intimate with
it
acknowledge it
take
responsibility
with it
for it
so the
expression of
grief
is a way
of being
intimate
with your
feelings
when you're
intimate with
it it's
yours
and when
it's yours
you are the
master of
it
it's very
liberating
somehow
many of us
particularly men
can't seem
to express
grief openly
I was like
that
that's the
way I was
raised
men don't
cry
it took a
zen master
god damn it
to teach me
how to cry
my teacher
very important
part of the
process of
letting go
of completing
the cycle
the body
disintegrates
where's the
true nature
the body
dies
where does
the true
nature go
what is the
true nature
one of the
characteristics
of
zen training
is to deal
with this
very early
on
so that
when the
time comes
one is able
to leave
this body
with a sense
of dignity
and completeness
that's something
we don't do
in our country
and something
that I hope
that we will
do here
at this
monastery
learn how
to do
that
there are
many many
stories
of old
masters
Tosotsu
himself
when he
came to
the end
of his
life
and he
was only
48 years
old
he was very
young
he had
great promise
of the future
he had lots
of students
the year
was 1091
he gathered
his disciples
around his bed
wrote his
last poem
that's what
usually happens
sits cross-legged
and passed
away
and this poem
said
48 years
I'm all
done
with the
ignorant
and the
wise
I'm not
a hero
my way
to Nirvana
is serene
and peaceful
another
master
master
Daimin
founder
of
Nanzenji
when he
came close
to his
end
wrote
the poem
in coming
I have
no abode
in leaving
I have
no fixed
direction
how is it
ultimately
here I am
all the
time
but it's
not always
like that
there's
a
a story
where is
that story
it's a
wonderful
little story
of one
master
master
Ryutan
Ryutan
dragon
gate
or dragon
mountain
or something
teacher
of
the
great
master
Ganto
and
Seppo's
teacher
any of
you monks
remember
huh
Toksan
right
Toksan's
teacher
so Ryutan
when it
came time
to die
he
wrote his
poem
gathered all
his monks
usually the monks
are all around
you know
and he wrote
his poem
and read it
to the monks
and then he
started preparing
to die
and he started
agonizing
crying
you know
and yelling
and wriggling
kind of scuffling
you know
he wasn't going
out smoothly
he was
resisting
and the monks
became very embarrassed
and they
they were trying
to hide
him
you know
so nobody
else would
see it
the newer monks
wouldn't see
this
and they
tried to
even
and he's
trying to
talk
while he's
doing this
while he's
screaming
and agonizing
and they
kept covering
his mouth
so that he
wouldn't
you know
cry out
and he
kept trying
to push
the hand
away
and finally
he pushed
the hand
away
and he
said
I tell
you
my
agonizing
crying
is not
different
at all
from my
joyful
singing
and finally
died
and so
what is
life
and what
is death
and who
are you
they're very
important
questions
and while
you're filled
with vitality
that's the
time
to put
them to
rest
it makes
all the
difference
in the
world
and how
the rest
of your
life goes
it's no
small thing
it's no
small thing
to be born
human
because you
have the
consciousness
that recognizes
life and
death
you have
the consciousness
that enables
you to
raise the
question
of life
and death
and within
that question
is the
answer
only you
can settle
it
it's not
something
someone can
give you
you need to
empower yourself
to put it
to rest
and the way
to do it
is the
dharma gate
of liberation
zazen
to study the
self is to
forget the
self and to
forget the
self is
zazen
whole body
and mind
zazen
it's right
there that
the question
comes and
it's right
there that
the question
is put to
rest
the answers
are to be
found
on this
mountain
this mountain
is you
this mountain
is your
life
but it's
not an easy
climb
the way
is covered
with boulders
and steep
cliffs
all of the
barriers
all of the
baggage
the mist
is heavy
and
its exact
location
is unknown
you must
trust yourself
in order
to find it
your
determination
and doubt
must also
be strong
takes those
three things
great faith
great doubt
and great
determination
to do it
and keep in
mind
whatever you
discover
along the
way
just simply
acknowledge it
and let it
go
throw it
away
and keep
going
and when
you finally
find out
what it is
that you're
seeking
acknowledge
that too
throw it
away
and keep
going
the journey
is endless
but it's a
wonderful
journey
bon voyage
and let it
march
to
the
show
which
横
it
the
즈
to
para
us
to
bud
it
and
West
and
the
and
