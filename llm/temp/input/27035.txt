The Blue Cliff Record
Case 56
Kinzan's single arrow piercing the three barriers
Master Ango's pointer
The Buddhas never appeared in the world
There is nothing to be given to people
The ancestor never came from the West
He never passed on the transmission by mind
Since people of these times do not understand
They frantically search outside themselves
They are far from knowing that the one great matter
Right where they are cannot be grasped
Even by a thousand sages
Right now
Where do seeing and not seeing
Hearing and not hearing
Speaking and not speaking
Knowing and not knowing
Come from
If you are unable to apprehend clearly
Then try to understand inside the cave of entangling vines
To test
I cite this old case
Listen
The main case
Zen traveler Ryo
Asked Kinzan
How is it when a single arrowhead smashes three barriers
Kinzan said
Bring out the Lord within the three barriers for me to see
Ryo said
So then knowing my fault
I must change
Kinzan said
Why wait any longer
Ryo said
A well shot arrow doesn't hit anywhere
And started to leave
Kinzan said
Come here a minute
Ryo turned his head
Kinzan grabbed him and held him tight
And said
Leaving aside for a moment
A single arrowhead
Smashing three barriers
Let's see you shoot an arrow
Ryo hesitated
Kinzan hit him
Seven times and said
I'll allow this fellow
We'll be doubting
For thirty more years
As the set shows verse
I bring out the Lord
Within the barriers for you
You disciples who would shoot an arrow
Don't be careless
Take an eye
And the ears go deaf
Let go an ear
And eyes both go blind
I can admire a single arrow point
Smashing three barriers
The trail of the arrow is truly clear
Don't you see?
Gensha had words for this
A great adept
Is the primordial ancestor of mind
Day two of our session
In a sense the whole point
Sitting
Says Shin
Is to
Clarify these barriers
That are spoken of here
It's very difficult
To
Pierce
The three barriers
With a single arrow
If you
Don't see the barriers
In the pointer
Ingo says
The Buddhas never appeared
In the world
There's nothing to be given
To the people
The ancestor
Never came from the west
He never passed on
The transmission
By mind
If all of this is true
Then
What are we doing?
What's it all about?
What's the mind-to-mind
Transmission about?
What's the lineage?
What's Shakyamuni Buddha?
What does he mean
Never appeared?
What does he mean
Nothing to be given?
What does he mean
Bodhidharma never
Cast on the mind-to-mind
Transmission?
And then he clarifies it
By saying
People of these times
Don't understand
They frantically search
Outside themselves
And that's usually
The process
That we get involved in
We
Become vaguely aware
Of the question
Or the problem
And immediately
We look
To the cause
And the solution
As something
That's outside of us
He says
They are far from knowing
That the one great matter
Right where they are
Cannot be grasped
Even by a thousand sages
That one great matter
What is it?
The koan itself
Is about that one great matter
Our whole practice
The seshin
Is about that one great matter
And indeed
It's one
Just one
Great matter
And then he goes on
To clarify it even further
He says
Right now
Where does seeing
And not seeing
Hearing
And not hearing
Speaking
And not speaking
Knowing
And not knowing
Come from
Where do they
Come from
Seeing
On one side
Is phenomenon
Not seeing
Is absolute
So basically
He's bringing up
All the dualities
Enlightenment
And delusion
Where does it
Come from
Then he goes on
To say
If you can't see it
Then try to understand it
From the cave
Of entangling vines
And that
Cave of entangling vines
In a sense
We can say
The koans
Are the cave
Of entangling vines
The Chinese character
For it
Was kind of a
Colloquial
Expression
Meaning
Complications
Difficulties
And many times
That it's used
In Zen
It's used
To refer
Specifically
To words
Or to
Koans
Themselves
And it's kind
Of interesting
The process
Of
Working with
The koan
It's amazing
How
How many people
Regard koans
As riddles
As something
That's ancient
That has nothing
To do with life
Koans are not
Riddles
They really
Have to do
With pointing out
The reality
Of life
That hasn't
Changed
In 2500 years
The reality
Of the truth
That the Buddha
Realized
And each
Of the successive
Generations
Realized
And transmitted
Remains the same
It doesn't
Change
And the
Complications
That we bring
To it
Are basically
The same
And people
Say
Why don't
We have
Modern koans
You could
Change the
Words
Make up
A story
Change the
Words
To this
How is it
When a
Single bullet
Hits three
Bullseyes
Bring out
The bullseyes
For me
And knowing
My fault
I must
Change
Why wait
Well shot
Round
Doesn't
Hit anything
Come here
A minute
Turns his
Head
Leaving aside
For a moment
A single
Bullet
Smashing
Three
Bullseyes
Let's
See you
Shoot
Right
Now
He
Hesitated
He
Hit him
But of course
Every time
We do
Dharma
Combat
Each one
Of those
Are
Khaans
In their
Own right
We could
Take any
One of them
Any one
Of the
Questions
And the
Answers
They had a
Pointer
And a
Verse
To it
And you've
Got a
Cone
And that's
About as
Up to date
As you can
Get
They come
Right out
Of the
Students
Own
Questions
But these
Things are
Not subject
To time
Or place
That's why
They're so
Important
That's why
They've been
Collected
Preserved
Passed
On
Because they
Work
They're an
Incredible
Process
For clarifying
The mind
One's
Understanding
Freeing
Us
From the
Bondage
Of using
Our minds
In that
Habitual
Linear
Sequential
Way
It has
No
Parallel
Anywhere
Outside
Of
The
Zen
School
The way
It's
Used
When
Practice
First
Starts
There are
Usually
Lots of
Things
That need
To be
Settled
Before
The calling
Can be
Undertaken
So in
That first
Stage
Of
Practice
There's
A lot
Of
Clearing
Away
A lot
Of
Settling
Complications
Because
It's
Very
Hard
To be
The
Koan
If
You're
Holding
On
To
Something
Else
And so
The early
Parts
Of
Practice
Have
To do
With
Dealing
With
Barriers
As
They
Come
Up
And
The
Practice
Itself
Is
Specifically
Designed
To
Dig
Them
Up
Usually
They're
Very
Neatly
Tucked
Away
At
Least
If
We're
Functional
They're
Neatly
Tucked
Away
That's
The
Way
People
Usually
Deal
With
Complications
They
Resolve
Them
By
Avoiding
Them
Sometimes
By
Suppressing
Them
Which
Is
Even
Worse
Sometimes
By
Overcoming
Them
Which
Is
Another
Process
But
One
Way
Or
Another
If
They're
Functional
Functional
Neurotics
Most of
Us
Are
Functional
Neurotics
It's
It's
Been
Somehow
Taken
Care
Of
But
Still
It's
There
It
Needs
To
Be
Brought
To
The
Surface
And
It
Needs
To
Be
Seen
What
It's
About
It's
Not
Enough
To
Push
It
Away
It's
Not
Enough
To
Overcome
It
Or
To
Suppress
It
We
Need
To
Be
Really
Intimate
With
It
And
In
A
Sense
Those
Beginning
Year
Or
Years
Depending
Upon
The
Person
Of
Zen
Training
Is
Almost
In
A
Way
Like
Therapy
Like
Some
Kinds
Of
Therapy
Let's
Say
Some
Forms
Of
Therapy
There
Are
Many
Different
Kinds
And
In
The
Context
Of
Zen
Training
Of
Course
Always
The
Work
Is
Being
Done
By
The
Student
Whether
The
Student
Realizes
That
Or
Not
Questions
Always
Turn
Back
On
Them
And
Sooner
Later
They
Work
Through
Them
Settle
Them
The
Big
Ones
The
Important
Ones
That
Keep
Intimacy
From
Happening
That
They're
Strong
Strong
Enough
To
Keep
The
Self
Isolated
From
The
Ten
Thousand
Things
When
We
Talk
About
Forgetting
The
Self
It's
An
Unfortunate
Term
Forget
The
Self
It
Implies
Some
Kind
Of
Negativity
Another
Way
Of
Expressing
It
Is
To
Let
The
Self
Encompass
The
Whole
Universe
Means
The
Same
Thing
No
Self
Or
All
Self
Is
Identical
So
Rather
Than
Getting
Rid
Of
Your
Ego
Make
It
Big
Enormous
Gigantic
So
That
It
Consumes
The
Entire
Universe
That
Big
An
Ego
You
Need
And
Then
Finally
When
The
Koan
Work
Itself
Starts
A
Student
Is
Basically
On
Their
Own
Simply
Because
What
Koans
Are
About
Is
Not
About
Information
So
Just
By
Virtue
Of
The
Nature
Of
Koans
There's
Nothing
Really
That
The
Teacher
Can
Do
I
Mean
Even
If
You
Could
Tell
Somebody
What
The
Solution
To
A
Koan
Is
Doesn't
Mean
That
What
That
Koan
Is
About
Is
Realized
The
Words
That
Describe
What
The
Koan
Is
About
Or
Absorbed
But
The
Koan
Itself
Is
An
Experience
You
Can't
Give
An
Experience
To
Someone
They
Must
Manifest
It
In
Their
Own
Lives
So
It's
Not
Information
That's
Being
Transmitted
It's
An
Experience
That's
Being
Realized
With
Each
Koan
Some
Are
Small
Some
Are
Large
Some
Are
Important
Some
Are
Not
So
Important
All
Of
Them
Are
Part
Of
A
Building
Block
Of
Realizing
Who
We
Are
What
The
Nature
Of
The
Self
Is
The
True
Self
So
Working
With
A
Koan
Is
Very
Very
Individual
As
Individual
As
You
Can
Get
And
Very
Empowering
Because
Each
Step
Each
Inch
That
You
Move
You
Move
With
Your
Own
Power
That's
Why
It's
Kind
Of
Funny
When
I
Read
Reports
About
Some
Groups
That
Do
Koan
Discussion
Groups
And
Take
A
Koan
Out
Of
The
Blue
Cliff
Record
And
Have
A
Discussion
On
It
What
Do
You
Think
Well
I
Think
You
Mean
Such
And
Such
And
Look
What
I
Found
Here
D.T.
Suzuki
Said
It
Means
So
And
So
And
Clearly
Says
This
And
It's
Kind
Of
Interesting
I
Mean
What
That
Does
Is
Supplies
Information
Again
And
Of
Course
Koans
Have
Nothing
To
Do
With
Information
So
When
You
Finish
With
It
What
You
Have
Is
Information
Isn't
It
Remarkable
That
It's
Possible
To
Translate
A
Complicated
Text
Such
As
This
Hundred
Koans
Blue
Cliff
Record
Verses
Commentaries
Pointers
Footnotes
Explanations
Meaning
Of
Words
And
So
On
And
Never
Have
Passed
The
Koan
Are
Not
Able
To
Pass
The
Koan
So
Obviously
There's
Something
Different
About
Understanding
And
Experiencing
That's
Very
Pivotal
Very
Critical
I
Often
Use
This
An
Example
You
Wake
Up
One
Morning
And
You
In
A
Life
Boat
There
You
Are
In
The
Middle
Of
The
Ocean
You
And
20
People
And
You
Have
No
Idea
Which
Way
Is
Shore
Which
Way
Is
Land
Or
The
Shortest
Route
To
Land
Now
Now
All the
Discussion
In
The
World
About
What
Way
To
Go
Or
Taking
Votes
Or
Deriving
A
Consensus
May
By
Accident
It's
Quite
Possible
Get
You
To
The
Shortest
Route
To
Land
But
Definitely
Not
Very
Certain
And
Yet
A
Single
Person
With
Navigational
Skills
Would
Know
If they
Had
Any
Sense
Of
Where
They
Were
When
The
Ship
Was
Lost
They
Would
And
So
You
Have
A
Group
Of
Philosophers
And
You
Want
To
Build
A
House
One
Carpenter
Is
King
You
Have
A
Group
Of
Carpenters
And
You
Want
To
Understand
Some
Of
The
Principles
Of
Life
One
Philosopher
Is
King
It
Always
Depends
On
The
Circumstances
And
What
It
Is
That
You
Trying
To
Accomplish
It's
Not
Simply
One
Side
Or
Another
There
Are
Times
That
Consensus
Are
Extremely
Important
And
Discussion
Is
Extremely
Important
It
Depends
On
What
You
Want
To
Do
With
The
Group
Dynamics
What
You
Want
To
Do
In
Terms
Of
Communication
And
Imparting
Information
And
Sometimes
Even
Experience
So
It's
So it's
Not
Just
Simply
One
Side
Or
Another
Most
Things
In
Life
Are
Not
Like
One
Side
Or
Another
Like
Football
There's
A lot
Of
Technical
Aspects
To
Football
Gotta
Know
The
Rules
Of
The
Game
In
Order
To
Play
You
Have
To
Know
How
The
Game
Works
In
Order
To
Play
So it's
Not
Enough
To be
Fleet of
Foot
And have
A great
Passing
Arm
And
Be
Able
To
Do
Broken
Field
Running
If
You
Don't
Know
How
To
Play
The
Game
You
Can't
Do
It
Yet
You
Can
Know
How
To
Play
The
Game
And
Not
Have
Those
Physical
Abilities
And
You
Can't
Do
It
Or
You
Can
Know
How
To
Play
The
Game
Have
The
Physical
Abilities
But
If
You're
Not
In
On
Some
Of
The
Techniques
Of
The
Team
What
We're
Going
To
Do
Means
Who's
Going
To
Pass
And
Who's
Going
To
Receive
Then
It
Doesn't
Work
Either
So
All
Of
Those
Pieces
Need
To
Come
Together
In
Order
To
Have
The
Full
Picture
And
Dharma
Is
No
Different
But
Always
That
Key
Is
The
Doing
And
Doing
Means
Practice
And
Sometimes
We
Don't
Realize
That
From
Moment
To
Moment
In
Everything
That
We
Do
In
A
Session
That
What
We're
Doing
Is
Confirming
Our
Practice
Actualizing
Our
Practice
Even
When
We're
Not
Practicing
It's
Happening
Because
It's
Hard
Not
To
Have
An
Awareness
Of
What
This
Context
And
Form
Is
About
You're
Constantly
Reminded
Of
It
So
You
Can
Sit
There
And
Daydream
Through
The
Miel
Gathas
But
Communication
Is
Happening
Even
If
It's
Communication
Of
The
Fact
That
You're
Not
Doing
The
Miel
Gathas
Or
That
You've
Lost
Awareness
So
It's
All
Important
Every
Speck
Of
It
Now
These
Three
Barriers
That
He's
Talking
About
There
Are
Lots
Of
Ideas
Because
These
Three
Barriers
Are
Not
Defined
By
Kinzan
Or
Anywhere
In
The
Literature
So
Everybody
Guesses
At
What
The
Three
Barriers
Are
Could
Be
Yakajot's
Three
Phrases
Which
Are
Detachment
Not
Abiding
In
Detachment
And
No
Understanding
Of
Detachment
Or
Uman's
Three
Phrases
Cutting
Off
The
Myriad
Streams
Following
After
The
Waves
And
Encompassing
Heaven
And
Earth
Or
It
Could
Be
Rinzai's
Three
Phrases
Of
Understanding
In
Koan
Studies
Seeing
The
Intent
Of
The
Koan
Seeing
The
Practical
Application
Of
The
Koan
And
Seeing
The
Point
Of
Transcendence
Of
The
Koan
And
In
Dealing
With
This
Koan
Before
Here
At
Doshinji
I've
Always
Used
The
Three
Poisons
As
The
Three
Barriers
And
Of
Course
It's
Not
Critical
What
The
Three
Barriers
Are
What's
Critical
Is
How
To
Pierce
The
Three
Barriers
Any
Three
Barriers
And
Whether
We
Speak
Of
Three
Or
Three
Thousand
Really
Doesn't
Make
A
Difference
How
Do
You
Pierce
The
Three
Thousand
Barriers
The
Session
Is
The
Bringing
Up
Of
These
Barriers
And
It's
Also
Bringing
Forth
The
Master
Of
The
Barriers
How
Do
You
Bring
Out
The
Master
Within
The
Three
Barriers
The
Three
Barriers
Are
Anger
Fear
And
Pain
What's
The
Master
Within
Anger
Fear
And
Pain
Greed
Anger
And
Ignorance
Are
The
Three
Barriers
Where
Is
The
Master
Zen
Traveler
Ryo
Asks
Kinzan
How
Is
It
When
A
Single
Arrowhead
Smashes
The
Three
Barriers
Ango's
Footnotes
Is
Danger
Undeniably
Ryo
Is
Extraordinary
He's
A
Fierce
General
Actually
He
He
Was
He
Was
One
Of
The
Great
Chinese
Generals
It
Must
Be
Pretty
Hairy
When
He
Grabs
A
Hole
Of
This
General
Who
Was
Ferocious
Known
All
Over
China
One
Incredible
Number
Of
Barriers
And
He
Grabs
Him
By
The
Head
And
Shakes
Him
And
Says
Let's
See
You
Shoot
An
Arrow
The
General
Hesitates
And
He
Hits
Him
Seven
Times
Many
A teacher
Lost
Their
Head
That
Way
So
When
He
Came
Forward
He
Came
Forward
Ready
For
Battle
How
Is
It
When
A
Single
Arrowhead
Smashes
The
Three
Barriers
Kinzan
Said
Bring
Out
The
Lord
Within
The
Barriers
For
Me
To
See
At
The
Same
In
One
Way
He's
Showing
Him
And
In
Another
Way
He's
Testing
Him
Both
Of
Those
Things
Are
Happening
At
Once
Footnote
Says
He
Comes
On
Directly
The
Footnote
Goes
On
That
Says
He
Wants
Everyone
To
Know
That
The
Rocky
Mountains
Are
High
And
The
Catskill
Mountains
Are
Low
Of
Of
Of
Of
Course
He
Said
Mount
Chew
And
Mount
On
Ryo
Said
So
Then
Knowing
My
Fault
I
Must
Change
Is
He
Being
Flexible
Footnote
Says
He
Seizes
Opportunity
In
Acts
Actually
It
Was
Pretty
Sharp
His
Response
But
Kinzan
Wouldn't
Let
Him
Get
Away
With
It
Immediately
He
Said
Why
Wait
So
Knowing
My
Fault
I
Must
Change
Why
Wait
Footnote
Says
There's
Capture
And
There's
Release
When
The
Wind
Moves
The
Grass
Bends
That's
The
Way
Dharma
Combat
Really
Goes
It's
Immediate
The
Response
The
Wind
Blows
From
The
East
Leaves
Gather
In
The
West
It's
Immediate
Why
Wait
Any
Longer
Then
Ryo
Said
A
Well
Shot
Arrow
Doesn't
Hit
Anywhere
And
Started
To
Leave
A
Footnote
Says
After
All
So
Ryo
Is
Trying
To
Change
His
Plea
He
Strikes
A
Second
Blow
But
Kinzan
Feels
No
Pain
It's
True
Well
Shot
Arrow
Doesn't
Hit
Anywhere
There's
A
Point
There
Not
Good
Enough
Kinzan
Immediately
Sees
Through
It
So
He
Calls
Out
To
Him
Says
Come
Here
A
Minute
A
Footnote
Says
Summoning
Him
Is
Easy
Dispatching
Him
Is
Hard
What
Good
Is
Someone
Who
Turns
His
Head
When
Called
Ryo
Turned
His
Head
Footnote
Says
As
It
Turns
Out
Ryo
Couldn't
Hold
Fast
He's
Hit
That
Turning
Of
The
Head
When
Called
It's
It's
Important
In
Order
To
Appreciate
The
Koans
To
Really
See
Them
To
Really
Be
In
Them
To
See
It
From
The
Perspective
Of
Kinzan
To
See
It
From
The
Perspective
Of
Ryo
Not
Only
See
It
From
Ryo's
Perspective
But
Feel
It
From
Ryo's
Perspective
Feel
It
As
A
As
A
Victorious
General
Would
Feel
It
As
This
Very
Important
Great
Noble
Would
Feel
It
And
When
He
Says
A
Well
Shot
Arrow
Doesn't
Hit
Anywhere
And
Shakes
Out
His
Sleeves
And
Turns
And
Starts
Walking
Out
That's
The
Way
A
Dharma
Combat
Would
Be
Concluded
When
A
Final
Smashing
Point
Is
Made
So
He
Walks
Out
With
All
This
Confidence
Kinzan
Calls
Him
Hey
General
He
Turns
His
Head
There's
Something
Incomplete
A
Turning
Of
His
Head
Indicates
That
Hesitancy
That
Doubt
That
Lack
Of
Clarity
And
It's
Right
There
That
He
Nails
Him
That's
Why
He
Calls
It
A
Hit
So
When
He
Turned
His
Head
Immediately
Kinzan
Grabbed
Him
Held
Him
Tight
And
Said
Leaving
Aside
For
A
Moment
The
Single
Arrowhead
Smashing
The
Three
Barriers
Let's
See
You
Shoot
An
Arrow
We
Know
That
He's
Weak
How
Weak
Is
He
How
Far
Does
It
Go
In
Fact
Kinzan
Is
Taking
A
Chance
Doing
This
Footnote
Says
Kinzan
Lies
Down
In
A
Tiger's
Mouth
And
It
Says
Having
Seen
One's
Duty
But
Not
Doing
It
Is
A
Lack
Of
Courage
That's
Why
Old
Master
At
Mount
Baldy
What's
His
Name
Huh
Suzuki
That's
Why
He
Said
That
A
Teacher
Needs
To
Be
Prepared
To
Die
Every
Doksan
Teacher
Must
Be
Prepared
To
Die
And
Ryo
Hesitated
Again
In
Confirmation
Footnote
Says
As
It
Turns
Out
He
Searches
Without
Finding
There's
That
Hesitancy
That
We
Talked
About
Yesterday
The
Mind
Is
Moving
Trying
To
Figure
It
Out
It's
Not
Immediate
And
Spontaneous
And
So
Acting
According
To
Imperative
Kinzan
Hit
Him
Seven
Times
And
Said
I'll
Allow
That
This
Fellow
Will
Be
Doubting
For
Thirty
More
Years
The
Footnote
Says
The
Imperative
Must
Be
So
There's
A
Beginning
There's
An
End
Kinzan
Is
Correct
At
The
Beginning
And
Correct
At
The
End
It's
Kinzan
Who
Should
Receive
This
Beating
Why
Would
Engo
Say
That
What
Is
The
Beating
What
Is
The
Hit
A
Lot
Of
People
Wonder
Why
Why
Didn't
He
Hit
Him
Eight
Times
Why
Didn't
He
Hit
Him
Six
Times
Why
Didn't
He
Hit
Him
Thirty
Times
Why
Just
Seven
Times
Usually
That's
The
First
Clue
That
Some
Real
Fine
Clear
Cut
Hair
Trigger
Rational
Thought
Is
Taking
Place
That's
Not
What
The
Con
Is
About
It's
Like
I
Remember
Once
We
Worked
For
A
Company
Doing
Research
And
It
Was
Around
The
Time
That
The
People's
Name
Was
Watson
James
Won
The
Nobel
Prize
For
Their
Work
In
Chromatography
Two
Englishmen
And
The
Rockefeller
Institute
Invited
Them
To
America
And
While
They
Were
Here
Our
Research
Director
Probably
Using
A lot
Of
Money
As
A
Means
Of
Convincing
Convinced
Them
These
Two
Great
Nobel
Prize
Winners
To
Spend
Two
Or
Three
Days
With
Us
The
Research
Team
And
Teach
Us
How
They
Made
Their
Gas
Chromatography
Chromatography
Equipment
And
So
I
Went
Along
With
The
Director
Of
The
Analytical
Department
To
Study
With
These
Men
And
These
Guys
Are
You
Know
Showing
Us
Everything
That
They
Did
And
The
Equations
For
The
Whole
Thing
And
How
The
Process
Work
And
How
To
Set
Up
The
Equipment
And
Everything
And
The
Guy
I
Was
With
Kept
Asking
Them
What
Kind
Of
Ink
Do
You
Use
In
The
What
This
Thing
Did
Was
Produce
The
Graph
It
Was
Changed
To
An
Electronic
Signal
And
That
Electronic
Signal
Drew
A
Graph
And
He
Kept
Asking
What
Kind
Of
Ink
Do
You
Use
In
The
Pen
That
Draws
The
Graph
I
Mean
You
Know
Here
Were
Two
He
Didn't
Know
I
Have
No
Idea
I
Buy
It
And
Here
Were
Two
Geniuses
Nobel
Prize
Winners
An
Opportunity
To
Brain
Pick
Them
To
Death
For
Three
Days
Where
Did
You
Get
The
Ink
Where
Did
You
Buy
Your
Clothes
What
Kind
Of
Shoes
Are
They
It
It
All
Beside
The
Point
That's
The
Same
With
Why
Didn't
He
Why
Did
He
Hit
Him
Why
Didn't
He
Hit
Him
Eight
Times
Or
Six
Times
Why
Just
Seven
Times
Setsho
Says
In
His
Verse
I
Bring
Out
The
Lord
Of
The
Barriers
For
You
How
You
Disciples
Who
Would
Shoot
An
Arrow
Don't
Be
Careless
That's
How
Take
An
Eye
And
The
Ears
Go
Deaf
Let
Go
An
Ear
And
The
Eyes
Both
Go
Blind
Isn't
That
Interesting
It's
Definitely
True
Sometimes
When
You're
Preoccupied
Visually
You're
Not
Hearing
Or
When
You're
Preoccupied
With
Hearing
You're
Not
Seeing
And
Yet
Let
Go
An
Ear
Both
Eyes
Go
Blind
The
Whole
Body
And
Mind
Goes
Blind
What
Kind
Of
Blindness
Is
That
Then
He
Said
I
Can
Admire
A
Single
Arrow
Point
Smashing
The
Three
Barriers
The
Trail
Of
The
Arrow
Is
Truly
Clear
Don't
Don't
You
See
And
The
Trail
Of
The
Arrows
This
Whole
Koan
And
All
The
Complications
Another
Master
Said
On
This
Case
That
Mr.
Ryo
Was
Well
Able
To
Shoot
Arrows
But
In
Essence
He
Didn't
Know
How
To
Hit
The
Target
A
Monk
Asked
Him
How
Can
One
Hit
The
Target
The
Master
Said
Bring
Out
The
Lord
Of
The
Barriers
Isn't
That
What
The
Whole
Thing
Boils
Down
To
Isn't
That
What
The
Great
Matter
Boils
Down
To
The
Lord
Of
The
Barriers
What
Is
The
Lord
The
Master
Of
The
Barrier
Mu
The
Barrier
The
Breath
The
Barriers
Of
The
One
Arrow
Piercing
Setsuo
Says
That
Bring
Out
The
Lord
Of
The
Barriers
For
You
Open
Your
Eyes
And
You
Can
See
Close
Your
Eyes
And
You
Can
See
Too
With
Form
Without
Form
Your
Disciples
Who
Would
Shoot
An
Arrow
Don't
Be
Careless
If
You're
Able
To
Shoot
Well
You
Won't
Be
Careless
If
You
Don't
Shoot
Well
Then
It's
Obvious
That
You're
Careless
To
.
To
To
To
To
To
so
right now
how do you reveal the master of the three barriers
do you too
want to wait to change
why wait any longer
changing what
to what
is there something lacking
if you can't show me
the master of the three barriers
then how do you shoot an arrow
don't be careless
no we tend to get caught up in one side or another side
and we carry that right into the Dharma
we clear away all of the difficulties
of the mundane
and we split up
the sacred into two parts
fear, anxiety, stress, hesitation
indecisiveness
confusion
pain
and the other side of that
arrogance
self-centeredness
manipulativeness
controlling
knowing
how is it when it falls
into neither side
how is it when the arrow shoots of itself
to bring forth the master of the three barriers
just to swallow the universe in a single gulp
don't forget the self
be the self
will the whole body and mind
be the self
and the whole body and mind
is the self
the ten thousand things
return to the self
where they've always been
seem contradictory
because of a reference system
that's why there's that insistence
of going beyond
the words
that doesn't make sense
forget the self
be the self
get rid of the ego
make a gigantic ego
gateless gate
it defies logic
and yet
none of it
is misleading
if you really
have let go
of the reference system
that's the beauty
of the whole thing
you hear this language
all the time
and you're always
bouncing it off
the reference system
and then one day
suddenly the reference system
drops away
and you understand
all those same words
in a totally different way
it's like finding the key
that unlocks the computer code
and suddenly all of this
jumble of information
is there
very very clear
and can be understood
immediately
and of course
that key
to the code
is Zazen
it's in Zazen
that you dissolve
the reference system
you dissolve
the reference system
by forgetting the self
or you dissolve
the reference system
by having the self
encompass the whole universe
there's no reference system
in either of those
and there's no self
in either of those
and whether we realize it or not
there's no self
in any of us
never was
can't be
and yet
we live in a time
and a place
and a society
and a culture
that really believes
that it's there
and that it's real
and that conditioning
goes so deep
it's so pervasive
that it takes
all of this
complication
to break through
of it
it's so pervasive
so far reaching
that it takes years
of practice
and training
to overcome
that illusion
that idea
that thought
and yet
it never was
that great matter
is
realizing that
for yourself
we've still got a good part
of this session
remaining
in which to do it
and how it finally
happens
still
remains a mystery
we know the process
we know what you have
to do
but what that
final triggering
thing is
is always up to you
there's no way
to predict it
it can happen
in a moment
it always happens
in a moment
that moment
can come soon
or it can take
a long time
to come
but we should
practice
always
as if that
moment is right
now
because in reality
it is
we need
to make
this
it is
it is
it
it
it
it
it
it
it
it
it
