The Book of Equanimity, Case 82,
Yunmen's Sound and Form,
Preface to the Assembly.
Not cutting off sound and form
is falling wherever you are.
Searching by way of sound
and looking by way of form,
you don't see the Buddha.
Isn't there anyone who can take the road
and return home?
The main case.
Yunmen said to the Assembly,
Hearing sound, awaken to the way.
Seeing form, understand the mind.
The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara
brings money to buy a sesame cake.
When she lowers her hand,
it turns out to be a jelly donut.
The Verse.
Going out the gate,
making the horse leap,
sweeping away the comets.
The smoke and dust of 10,000 countries
is spontaneously clear.
The twelve media are free
of useless images and echoes.
Pure light emanates
in a billion worlds.
It's now at our last full day
of the session.
And we're doing
the discourse this morning
instead of this afternoon
because of
my having to
repay an obligation
of Zen Mountain Monastery
to
the Seto Karate Organization.
They're
celebrating their
14th anniversary today.
And last year,
right about this time,
we had a
mountain seat ceremony
and they canceled
their anniversary celebration
in order for the students
to be here.
So we kind of owe them one.
and
I couldn't come up
with really
any excuses
not to
go there
and make a
small speech
for them
this afternoon.
So we switched
to morning discourse.
Actually,
morning is when
it usually is.
That's traditional,
the traditional time
to do it.
We do it in the afternoon
because it
kind of breaks up
the afternoon
a little bit.
Tomorrow,
we're going to be doing
Dharma combat.
So
as a way
of training
the Sangha
for the Dharma combat
that comes
at the end
of next session
the Shuso Hosin
where the Shuso
does the Dharma combat
with the Sangha.
So tomorrow
you'll get
an opportunity
to
hone your abilities
with me
and
this evening
and this afternoon
will be
a good opportunity.
to sit deeply
so that your
minds are nice
and clear
tomorrow
for Dharma combat.
This koan
kind of relates
to the
one that we
did yesterday.
That koan yesterday
was kind of
straightforward
and yet
a lot of people
had questions
questions about it
so I figured
I'd go a little
bit further
with it
with this koan.
It's really
addressing the same
point.
In a sense
you can say
all 1700 koans
and all of the sutras
and all of the
sayings
all address
the same point.
They're all making
the same point.
I remember
I used to
every once in a while
I'd say to my teacher
after he gave
a taste show
and I'd say
boy that was a
great taste show
Roshi
and he'd look at me
kind of quizzically
and say
it's the same thing
I've always been saying.
I say the same thing
each time.
Somehow
one time
you get it
another time
you don't get it
so
what we do
is just keep
repeating
the same old stuff
500,000 different ways
until people
see it
for themselves
realize it
for themselves.
Someone
during Dokusan
referred to
a koan
I had done
some time ago
in which
I think the poem
used the phrase
God
God mask
devil mask
in referring to
Master Zwegen
who every morning
used to wake up
and say to himself
Master
and then he would
answer himself
Yes Master
and then he would say
never be deceived
by anyone
any time
any place
and then he would
answer
Yes Master
so in the
verse to that
koan
Master Mumman
used this phrase
God's mask
devil mask
and in a sense
that phrase
refers to
the Bodhisattva
of compassion
Avalokiteshvara
Bodhisattva
who manifests
her compassion
according to
circumstances
but when she's
manifesting
her compassion
she's always
appearing
in a form
appropriate
for the
circumstances
so she doesn't
go as a
winged angel
with a halo
around her head
when she needs
to teach
the hell's angels
she comes
as a
hell's angel
in the form
of a hell's angel
and is able
to teach
with no sense
of separation
in addressing
a god
she appears
as a god
in addressing
a devil
she appears
as a devil
always in a
form appropriate
to the
circumstances
in the introduction
to this
koan
it says
not cutting
off sound
and form
is falling
wherever you
are
searching
by way
of sound
and looking
by way
of form
you don't
see the
Buddha
and yet
in the main
case it says
hearing sound
awaken to the
way
seeing form
understand the
mind
again
are these
contradictions
they're saying
something different
or they're saying
the same thing
well it's
pretty standard
teaching in
Buddhism
that chasing
sounds and
following forms
must be avoided
at all costs
being controlled
and manipulated
by sounds
and forms
and
umban in another
koan
actually
a koan
that we use
for people
who are going
to become monks
they need to pass
through this koan
it's called
bell sound
and the priest's
robe
and uman
addressing the
assembly
said
this world
is vast
and boundless
why
when the bell
rings
do you put on
your priestly
robes
what he's saying
is that there's
absolutely
complete
unequivocal
freedom
that reaches
everywhere
that's the life
of us
that's what
our training
is about
yet
the bell rings
and you put
on your robes
the clappers
go
and you start
kin hin
how is that
freedom
why do you
do it
basically
what uman
is saying
in this koan
is hear the
sound
and awaken
see the
form
and realize
the mind
that's very
different than
chasing after
the difference
between chasing
after
and hearing
and seeing
is intimacy
no separation
hearing sound
awaken to the
way
seeing form
understand the
mind
then he goes
on to say
the bodhisattva
Avalokiteshvara
brings money
to buy a
sesame cake
when she lowers
her hand
it turns out
to be a
jelly donut
why not
I mean
you know
Jesus
multiplied
the loaves
and
Moses
opened
the red
sea
why can't
Avalokiteshvara
turn a
sesame bun
into a
jelly donut
there's a
teaching
there's a
magic
there's
something
going on
and that's
what we
need to
see in
order to
appreciate
this
coin
in another
case
a monk
asks
Master
Kempo
the
Bhagavats
of the
ten
directions
have one
way
to
nirvana
I wonder
what it
is
and
Kempo
took his
stick
and drew
a line
and said
it's right
here
monk
didn't
understand
he went
to
Uman
and he
told
Uman
what
happened
he said
I don't
understand
please
teach me
Uman
held up
his fan
and said
this fan
jumps
to the
fifth
heaven
and hits
the deity
on the
nose
there
again
is that
magic
or is
he saying
something
that needs
to be
seen
in the
commentary
to this
coin
the
statement
says
Tian
Tong
brings up
the story
talking about
the swift
steed
omitting
its color
talking about
the swift
steed
and omitting
its color
is essentially
directing
yourself
to the
essence
and not
worrying
about
the
details
and that's
what the
koan
is
taken
the
essence
of
something
that
appeared
in the
original
record
of
Uman
and in
the
original
record
of
Uman
said
to the
assembly
hearing
sound
realize
the way
seeing
form
understand
the
mind
how is
this
then he
raised
his hand
and said
Avilokiteshvara
Bodhisattva
brings money
to buy
a sesame
cake
when she
lowers
her hand
actually it
turns out
to be a
jelly donut
so basically
how is
this
explains
hearing
sound
realizing
the way
seeing
form
understand
the
mind
still don't
see it
right
right
okay
another
teacher
the national
teacher
commenting on
this
said
we might
say
of
Yunmen
that his
tune
as his
tune
became
more lofty
those who
harmonized
became
rarer
and it's
kind of
true
of
Uman
Uman's
zen is
very
very
obtruse
very difficult
to
appreciate
you need
to
appreciate
his
style
before you
can
appreciate
the way
he uses
words
his
teaching
was
called
lip and
mouth
zen
very
similar
to
Joshu
only
not so
cutting
as
Joshu
much
more
subtle
than
Joshu
he
never
used
the
devices
of
such
teachers
as
Rinzai
with
the
shout
or
the
punch
he
always
did it
with
turning
words
and it
said
that
his
words
always
contained
three
phrases
one of
those
phrases
is the
phrase
and it
could be
a single
word
someone
once
asked
them
what
is
Buddha
and his
answer
was
a
sesame
cake
or
buns
sesame
buns
that
single
statement
sesame
buns
contains
the
three
phrases
of
uman
and the
first
phrase
cuts
off
the
myriad
streams
called
cutting
off
the
myriad
streams
the
second
is
following
after
the
waves
and
the
third
is
it
encompasses
heaven
and
earth
and one
of his
disciples
made a
poem
on each
one of
those
three
phrases
to help
you
understand
it
even a
little
bit
more
the
first
on
containing
the
whole
world
containing
the
whole
universe
that is
oneness
he says
fundamental
reality
fundamental
emptiness
one
form
one
flavor
it's
not
that a
subtle
entity
doesn't
exist
it's
not a
matter
for
hesitating
over
clear
and lucid
this
contains
the
whole
world
that's
one
phrase
cutting
off
the
myriad
streams
he
says
it
is
fundamentally
not a
matter
of
interpretation
or
understanding
when you
sum it
all up
it's not
worth a
single
letter
when the
myriad
activities
abruptly
cease
that's
cutting
off
the
myriad
streams
in other
words
stopping
all
thought
seeing
directly
pure
cognition
without
extra
then
the
third
following
the
waves
when
you
allow
the
presence
of
another
follow
the
sprouts
to
describe
the
ground
understand
the
person
by
means
of
their
words
this
is
going
along
with
the
ripples
following
the
waves
in
other
words
adapting
the
teaching
in
accord
with
the
circumstance
so
one
adapts
the
teaching
in
accord
with
the
circumstance
another
abruptly
cuts
off
all
thought
and
the
third
encompasses
heaven
and
earth
those
three
phrases
are
contained
in
the
single
phrase
sesame
seed
bun
or
in
this
teaching
in
this
column
and
he
used
he
had
a
way
of
teaching
to
use
what
he
called
substitute
sayings
in
which
he
answers
a
question
that
he
poses
himself
and
that's
the
case
in
this
in
this
column
or
he
supplies
an
answer
to
a
question
of
an
earlier
master
substituting
the
saying
for
some
speechless
monk
in
the
khan
or
he
gives
an
alternative
saying
another
way
of
seeing
the
same
thing
such
in
the
case
that
I
already
mentioned
when
the
monk
asked
about
the
one
way
of
the
Bhagavats
in
Kempo
drew
a line
and
Uman
held
up
his
fan
and
said
this
fan
jumps
to
the
thirty
second
heaven
and
hits
the
deity
there
on
the
nose
that's
an
alternative
interpretation
of
what
another
master
said
so
these
devices
of
Uman
were his
style
of teaching
and
they're
functioning
in
this
koan
and
the
national
teacher
says
right
now
of
Uman
he
enters
the
universal
net
meditation
atop
my
whisk
atop
my
whisk
is
the
fly
whisk
he's
saying
that
Uman
has
entered
the
universal
net
meditation
the
universal
net
is
that
diamond
net
of
Indra
which
every
facet
of
the
net
reflects
and
contains
every
other
facet
in
the
net
throughout
time
and
space
that
is
Uman
is
completely
unified
with
all
phenomena
absolute
and
relative
past
present
future
no
separation
that's
what he's
he
right
now
enters
the
universal
net
meditation
that
statement
he
enters
concentration
in the
east
and
emerges
from it
in the
west
he
enters
concentration
in a
male
body
and
emerges
in a
female
body
but
do you
understand
what is
east
what is
west
what is
maleness
femaleness
then he
goes on
to say
the colors
of the
meadow
are not
blocked
anymore
by
mountains
the
moonlight
and
water
directly
penetrate
each
other
I
say
seeking
without
finding
in the
ocean
instead
they
meet
on
the
shore
this
is
all
the
statement
of
the
national
teacher
with
regard
to
Uman
the
moonlight
and
the
water
directly
penetrate
each
other
like
two
arrows
meeting
in
midair
there's
all
this
magic
appears
on the
top
of his
whisk
enters
meditation
with a
male
body
merges
with a
female
body
goes in
in the
west
comes out
in the
east
what is
mind
who are
you
I mentioned
yesterday
Buddhism's
way of
understanding
mind
indeed
of
understanding
reality
and I've
used this
example
many times
before
if you
imagine
a
sine wave
and then
draw across
the top
of that
sine wave
six lines
at the
peak
of it
those six
lines are
the first
six levels
of consciousness
eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body and mind
the six
organs
of perception
those six
organs of
perception
when they
interact with
the six
objects
form
sound
odor
flavor
thought
for mind
and those
six things
interact
with
consciousness
you create
what we
call
reality
if you
remove
any of the
six organs
you remove
that reality
so if there's
no I
even though
there's form
the form
is not
perceived
with the
eye
if you
remove the
form
but the
eye is
there
it can't
be seen
so they're
mutually
interdependent
in order to
create reality
so mind
is the organ
of perception
thought
is the
object of
perception
and consciousness
together
creates the
reality
which is
just as
real
as the
reality
of
of a
an object
you all
know the
experience
you know
you're
in a dream
and
someone
awful
is chasing
you
and you're
running
and the
adrenaline
is pumping
through your
veins
and you
break out
into a
sweat
and you're
panting
for air
and suddenly
you wake
up
and there
you sit
dripping
with
perspiration
breathing
heavy
like you're
out of
breath
and you
say oh
wow
that was
only a
dream
it was
just my
mind
that was
doing
that
well I
tell you
it's just
your mind
that's doing
this
right now
a hypnotist
puts somebody
in a
trance
and says
I'm now
going to
touch you
with a
hot poker
touches
them with
their
finger
within
seconds
a blister
appears
where does
it come
from
who created
it
the finger
the hypnotist
is that any
different than
anger
where does
that come
from
who created
it
who's
responsible
fear
anxiety
delusion
enlightenment
master
yes master
never be
deceived by
anyone
any time
any place
yes master
since the
ten thousand
things are
originally pure
why do
mountains and
rivers suddenly
appear
yesterday's
koan
indeed
since the
ten thousand
things are
originally pure
why do
mountains and
rivers suddenly
appear
suddenly pure
or pure
means there's
no separation
that you
and the
mountains and
rivers are
the same
reality
you and
the form
and the
sound are
the same
reality
in that
little
sine wave
we go down
a little lower
past the
first six
lines across
this is just
a really
simplistic
way
of explaining
the
Buddhist
psychology
and the
Abhidharma
so
there's a
lot more
to it
don't get
hooked
on this
but you
go down
a little
low
and you
draw another
little line
across
and that's
the seventh
level of
consciousness
called
manis
consciousness
or I
consciousness
ego
consciousness
that's the
thing that's
constantly
saying
I'm here
I'm here
you're there
you're there
I'm here
it's mine
you're there
it's not
yours
that's the
thing that
locks us
into the
bag of
skin
that's the
thing that's
got us
convinced that
that's what
we are
a skin
bag
and everything
inside is me
and everything
outside is the
rest of the
universe and
that's the
basis of all
delusion and
all separation
and then right
below the
seventh level of
consciousness
there's another
one
the eighth
called the
alaya
viznaya
or the
storehouse
consciousness
that's where
the seeds
of our
action
the
repository
called also
the seed
repository
karma
and in a
sense that
karma
that eighth
level of
consciousness
is constantly
feeding into
the
way the
six levels
are interacting
and perceiving
and so there
we are inside
this sine
wave
and through
the six
senses
way up at
the peak
we look out
over this
vast ocean
and there
we see all
these other
waves
big waves
and little
waves
short waves
and tall
waves
fat waves
and skinny
waves
new waves
and old
waves
hundreds of
different forms
and shapes
the myriad
things
and then we
look down
at ourselves
and we see
we're a wave
and obviously
that wave
and this wave
is not the
same wave
that's a
fat one
and this is
a skinny
one
or that's
a female
one
and this
is a male
one
or that's
a child
one
and this
is an
adult
one
look how
different
we are
well that's
a dog
and I'm
a human
that's a
mountain
and I'm
a person
and when
you really
look
instead of
looking out
take a
look in
and you
begin to
get past
those six
levels of
consciousness
past the
ego
past the
eighth level
of consciousness
you get to
the ninth
the great
ocean
itself
and you
begin to
realize
that all
of those
different
shapes
and forms
are
manifestations
of the
same
reality
which is
none other
than
yourself
what is it
that's born
what is it
that dies
what is it
that comes
what is it
that goes
Ramanakaya
Buddha
corporal body
what is it
that remains
Dharmakaya
pure
dharmakaya
Buddha
neither comes
nor does it
go
what are you
all Buddhas
have the
three bodies
all sentient
beings have
the three bodies
some may
realize it
some may
not
the moonlight
and the
water
directly
penetrate
each other
that's the
fourth rank
of Master
Tozan
first rank
of Master
Tozan
is the
realm
of emptiness
what we
call
absolute
samadhi
I talked
about it
yesterday
experiencing
the great
death
sky
vanishes
the iron
mountain
crumbles
above
there's not
a thing
to cover
the head
below
there's not
an inch
of ground
to stand
on
all of the
delusive
passions
become
non-existent
enlightenment
is non-existent
samsara
is non-existent
nirvana
is non-existent
there's no
sound
no color
no odor
the absolute
basis
of reality
there's no
knowing that
absolute
unity
the second
of
that's called
a relative
within the
absolute
the second
rank
of Tozan
is the
relative
within the
real
within the
apparent
or the
absolute
within the
relative
and it's
in that
second rank
that what
we call
kensho
occurs
that's
where
what
was
experienced
is realized
one leaves
the realm
of emptiness
and enters
into the
realm
of all
kinds
of
differentiation
and all
the
differentiations
are regarded
as one's
own
original
true
aspect
like looking
into a
clear mirror
and seeing
one's own
face in it
this is called
body and mind
fallen away
this is the
original purity
let the
master soar
in yesterday's
koan and
said indeed
why do
mountains and
rivers
suddenly appear
why do
fears
and desires
suddenly appear
why do
barriers
appear
we create
the universe
by the way
we use
our mind
the third
of these
ranks
is coming
from within
the absolute
here is a
maturity
and understanding
this is the
manifestation
of compassion
this is the
activity
of wisdom
in the world
of differences
but this is
still
not over
when we come
to the fourth
rank
mutual
integration
coming from
both
the absolute
and the relative
that's those
two arrows
meeting in
midair
maybe I need
to see a
neurosurgeon
something
I keep
missing my
fingers
here
no I've
got it
it's okay
so in that
mutual
integration
that's the
tenth ox-herding
picture
heads covered
with dust
face streaked
with dirt
moving through
the world
on the road
yet not having
left the house
the mountain
not having
left the
mountain yet
on the road
no one can
discern whether
this is an
ordinary person
or a sage
but still
this is dualistic
because it's
coming from
both sides
it's coming
from both sides
they're still
absolute
they're still
relative
they're still
yin
they're still
yang
and then
finally the
fifth rank
is no trace
of enlightenment
remains
unity attained
no distinguishing
between either
of these
the fourth rank
is that
moonlight
and the water
directly penetrate
each other
in the
verse
and in the verse
he brings it all
together beautifully
going out the gate
making the horse
leap
sweeping away
the comets
the smoke
and dust
of ten thousand
countries
is spontaneously
clear
the twelve
media are free
of useless
images and echoes
pure light
emanates in a
billion worlds
one of the
biggest things
that you end up
struggling with
when you're doing
Cohen's study
is grasping
the metaphors
that he used
and it would be
just as difficult
if for example
we wrote
modern koans
in street talk
street language
or slang
I mean
you know
if you look back
at the slang
of fifty years ago
it's hard to understand
what they're talking about
it's hard to understand
what they're talking about
with the slang today
the street talk
and that basically
that's what a lot
of these images are
kind of the
vernacular
of the time
and a lot of them
refer to stories
stories that were
being passed around
at the time
images that people
knew
and then that gets
translated from
Chinese into English
and it seems
very very
obtruse
and difficult
to comprehend
but once you get
the swing of it
you begin to hear
the language
you
you
you get it
I mean
it's just like
learning a foreign language
and then hearing a joke
in that foreign language
you don't get it
I mean
it just doesn't seem funny
but as you become
more familiar
with the culture
and the feelings
of the culture
it becomes funny
that same kind
of getting it
has to happen
with these koans
so going out
the gate
making the horse leap
sweeping away
the comets
going out
the gate
is
Uman
going outside
the monastery gate
in other words
going into the world
making the horse leap
is
is a
you know
a fine
master
of
the saddle
that can
get the horse
to leap over
obstructions
and just
make its way
swiftly
and with ease
this is a
a master at it
sweeping away
the comets
so
going out
the gate
making a horse
leap
he's sweeping
away the comets
and the comets
are
an image
that's used
that's
not a pleasant image
it's
not evil
evil
is not the right
word for it
an omen
a bad omen
is the comet
so he sweeps
away the bad
omens
with this
koan
making a horse
leap
is this koan
and then
it says
the smoke
and dust
of 10,000
countries
is spontaneously
cleared
10,000
countries
means
the myriad
things
the whole
phenomenal
universe
the 12
media
in here
is the
six
sense organs
eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
mind
and the
six
objects
of those
six
sense
organs
together
there's
12
the 12
media
is what
creates
reality
and
so the
10,000
countries
the myriad
things
the million
things
we look
all the
waves
out in
the vast
ocean
and the
senses
and the
objects
of the
senses
are made
spontaneously
clear
all of
the dust
is swept
away
the 12
media
are free
of useless
images
and echoes
he says
hearing
sound
awaken
to the
way
does
the
way
have
a
sound
what's
the
sound
of the
way
seeing
form
understand
the
mind
does
the
mind
have
form
why
do the
mountains
and rivers
appear
what
mountains
and rivers
are you
talking
about
you can
only see
them
if you're
separate
from them
when you
are the
thing
itself
there's
no
knowing
it
in
intimacy
there's
no
knowing
this is
great
I'm
intimate
that's
not
intimate
be the
breath
I was
the breath
how do you
know you
were the
breath
if you're
looking at
it
and
acknowledging
it
and
thinking
about
it
there's
no
intimacy
there
with
the
breath
in
order
to
know
you
need
a
knower
and
the
knower
and the
thing
that
the
knower
knows
is
two
when
they
merge
there's
no
knowing
that's
what
Bodhidharma
was
talking
about
when
Emperor
Wu
said
to him
well
who
are
you
standing
here
before
me
and he
said
I
don't
know
the
old
man
wasn't
stupid
he
was
clear
the
comet
it's
a
bad
omen
taking
sound
and
form
for
image
and
echo
represents
the
taking
sound
and
form
for
image
and
echo
represents
the
unreality
of those
things
image
means
a
reflection
in
a
mirror
taking
the
reflection
as
real
as
the
thing
itself
the
moon
and
the
water
seeing
them
as
separate
in
the
in
the
commentary
it says
moon
and
water
penetrated
that's
very
different
but
moon
and
water
as
a
reflection
going
to
the
reflection
thinking
that's
the
moon
still
has
separation
there's
no
intimacy
echo
as
a
reverberating
sound
in an
empty
valley
both
of
these
things
are
like
comets
in the
mind
of
the
way
that
is
the
bad
omen
the
light
of a
billion
worlds
shines
through
reflections
and
echoes
the
minute
you
get
rid
of
reflections
and
echoes
the
light
is
released
otherwise
what you're
looking at
is all
this
bouncing
around
where's
the
thing
itself
it's
like
a
house
of
mirrors
you
can't
find
your
way
through
it
looks
like
there's
an
exit
and you
walk
into
and you
walked
into
a
wall
and you
turn
and you
walk
into
another
wall
get
rid of
all the
mirrors
the mystery
is gone
it's just
a little
box
of a
room
you can
see the
way in
and the
way out
no question
about it
same
with
echoes
that
whatever
inquilichus
does
throws
their
voice
and has
it
bounce
off
the
wall
and you
look
and there's
nothing
there
bounces
over there
and there's
nothing
there
where's
the voice
coming from
what's
real
what's
reality
what's
truth
who are
you
old
Ba Zhang
Yakujo
used to
say
the
spiritual
light
shines
alone
far
transcending
the senses
you know
it's kind
of interesting
with light
you can't
see light
until it
bounces off
something
there's no
knowing light
I mean
out in
outer space
there's light
all over the
place
you don't
see it
it's just
black
but the
minute an
object
appears
dust
for example
that surrounds
the earth
and the earth
glows
or reflects
the moon
reflects
the spaceship
reflects
but with
light
itself
it needs
to bounce
off
something
reflect
off
something
be dispersed
by something
and what
you see
is the
thing
that it's
bouncing
off
not the
light
itself
spiritual
light
shines
alone
spiritual
light
shines
all
one
as one
thing
throughout
the whole
universe
is beyond
the senses
beyond
perception
we proceed
through
practice
with the
assumption
that what
we attain
needs to
become
part of
our
understanding
no matter
how many
times
we talk
about
koans
and say
that there's
a whole
other thing
that's
happening
it's a
direct
experience
we inevitably
twist and
turn and
force
in order to
take what
was realized
and make it
what was
understood
and the minute
you do that
you've lost it
you understand it
but you don't
realize it
you want to
understand it
go to any
college
take a course
in buddhism
you'll get all
you'll get all
the understanding
you need
what our
practice is
is realization
making it
your own
hearing sound
awaken to the
way
seeing form
understand the
mind
dogan says
seeing form
with a whole
body and
mind
one understands
them
intimately
hearing sound
with a whole
body and
mind
one understands
it intimately
understanding
it intimately
is very
very different
than understanding
in understanding
it intimately
there is no
knowing
there is no
knower
there is no
thing known
so understand
the breath
intimately
understand the
koan
intimately
understand your
life
intimately
understand these
mountains and
rivers and the
great earth
itself
intimately
don't separate
yourself
that's the
key to the
functioning of
our
avalokiteshvara
bodhisattva
there's no
intimacy
going out
into the
world
I'm going
to save
you
I'm going
to save
you
with separation
if you want
to save
all sentient
beings
be
all sentient
beings
and be
prepared to
be saved
by all
sentient
beings
that's
mutual
interpenetration
acknowledging
mutual
identity
acknowledging
codependency
no master
asks if
suddenly
each
sense
faculty
and each
sense
field
extended
throughout
the whole
universe
what would
that be
like
if the
eye
extended
throughout
the
universe
if the
mind
extended
throughout
the
universe
if
thought
extended
throughout
the
universe
if taste extended
throughout the universe
how is that?
Then he answers
I thought it was a jelly donut
and after all
it's a sesame cake.
Do you understand?
Well, if you do
you've missed it.
It's got nothing to do with understanding.
So throw that away
and keep going.
See it from the point of view
of umman.
See it from the point of view
of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva.
Forget the self.
See it from the point of view
of the breath
of the mountains and rivers themselves
of Mu
of the whole phenomenal universe.
Step out of the skin bag
just for a moment
and realize
the whole catastrophe
as nothing but yourself.
then you're speaking
the same language
as umman
as the buddhas
as the ancestors.
Step out of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the people
of the world
and these
have been
by an invention
of the world
of the world
of the world
to a wood
of the world
of the world
of the world
and the everybody
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
of the world
