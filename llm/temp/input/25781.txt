The God does true meaning.
Good morning, everyone.
And Adeshi mentioned last night that he could use some time to get all of his camping equipment,
all ten pounds of it into the five-pound sack, so you have me today rather than him.
Planting flowers on a smooth river rock.
Or now what will you do?
Yaoshan says to Shitao,
I comprehend the basic sutras that clarify all manifestation,
yet I long to receive the radical transmission by which the master points directly to mind,
allowing the disciple to realize mind's nature and thereby become a living Buddha.
Shitao says,
No step-by-step understanding will work.
The sudden approach won't work either,
nor will any combination of the two.
Now what are you going to do?
Stunned, Yaoshan stands speechless for a few moments.
Before he can gather any thoughts whatsoever,
the uncompromising Shitao sternly sends him to visit the mountain of Master Ma.
Entering the more gentle atmosphere, it's said, of Matsu,
the aspirant once again requests direct pointing to mind.
Master Ma replies,
Only the one mind raises these eyebrows and blinks these eyelids.
Sometimes gestures occur, sometimes not.
It makes no difference.
Now what are you going to do?
This translator then says,
Flooded suddenly with omniconscious light,
the potential successor melts into a deep bow.
Master Ma says,
What glimpse have you received that causes you to bow so profoundly?
Yaoshan says,
When standing before Shitao, it felt completely different,
like a mosquito attempting to bite an iron ox.
Master Ma said,
Through the wonderful kindness of Shitao,
you are awakened, but you must refine it.
Those of you who were here for my Shusa Hosen know that I have a particular relationship with that line,
like a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull.
It's part of the ceremony of becoming a senior student when you give your first talk.
After you do so, you basically apologize for the mess you've made.
And part of your apology is to say,
It felt like a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull.
I felt like that.
I was so nervous, I said,
I felt like an iron bull trying to bite a mosquito.
Which had the same feeling of impossibility.
So, Shitao is the prime teacher here.
The original teacher.
He's basically answering Yaoshan's question.
Saying there's nothing you can do.
Or not do.
Nothing will get you there.
Nothing works.
Nothing will open it.
You can go slow.
You can go fast.
You can go gradually.
You can go completely.
Hopefully, you'll never arrive.
In one sense, a way to understand what's happening with Shitao
is he's pointing out the absoluteness of relativity.
That if what you're seeking is the absolute, the true essence, the ultimate,
you're entering into an impossible activity
because every experience is relative by its nature.
If you experience it, it's relative.
It didn't exist.
It did.
And eventually, it won't.
It's an experience.
So, any experience is relative.
In some sense, this is often called the father energy in Zen.
The absolute, the kind of massive, what Thurman calls the massive facticity of the mountain.
You know, that you can't quite reach it.
There's no way there.
There's no one.
And the frustration of that impenetrability,
that inability to find connection, to find entry.
It reminded me of, in the last weekend's introduction to Zen,
we deal with the moral and ethical teachings, the precepts.
And one of the students who was attending at the group session at the end,
which is a little less formal,
and people tend to really say more what's in their guts,
you know, like what's bothering them.
And this one man raised his hand and said,
but this killing thing, you know, you say no killing.
And yet, you know, I've been here on Sundays.
You guys serve meat.
You know, what is this precept on non-killing?
How do you understand that?
And in a way, it was such a beautiful reflection of that process we all go through,
that moment of really looking at what is it to commit yourself to truth,
to living in a way that's clear.
And he's taking up the implications of that commitment.
And, you know, one way of answering it is to explain different perspectives on the precept,
which are obvious.
You know, you can say the precept of not killing means don't kill.
That's the truth of it.
Just don't kill.
That's the heart of the matter.
And then there's another perspective that says,
but there's a time when the only way to keep that precept
is when out of compassion and reverence for all life, you do kill.
And Ida, she often gives the example of, you know,
you're hiking deep in the woods.
You're alone and you're distant and you come upon a wounded animal
that is suffering greatly, just calling out in its pain.
And it's obvious it's going to die, it's going to pass.
And in its meeting with you, it's clear, you know, to your spinal column, clear,
that what's called for is to relieve this suffering,
that whatever is, you know, mental that could be learned from this process of dying,
that it's a clear message.
It's time to alleviate the suffering here.
And if out of some kind of selfish withdrawing into not wanting to deal with this issue
or it seems icky or you know you can just walk away,
you don't respond to that suffering by killing this animal,
then you've broken the precept, the heart of the precept, do not kill.
So out of compassion and reverence for life, realize do not kill.
And then there's another perspective, the wholeness,
in which who could possibly kill what?
There's nothing outside you.
There's no one to kill anything.
Killing is impossible.
Why?
And what's the implication, the deep, living Buddha life,
of manifesting that precept?
We each take that on when we enter consciously into a life that we call practice.
Do we become a vegetarian?
Do we protest abortion or support it?
Do we, you know, how do we respond to a war that seems just,
is in response to some horrendous suffering?
How do we deal with that?
Or as Shitao and Baso, Matsu said,
now what will you do?
It's one thing to understand.
But what will you do?
And this is where the koan begins to come to life.
Master Ma's position in this, Baso, Master Matsu,
is basically saying, you know, everything functions, everything reveals the truth.
How could it be otherwise?
It's the great dance, our Dharma cousin, Lex Hickson calls it,
the great dance of eyebrows, stars, branches, and banners in the bright wind.
And if it's all one, then there's no action, no thing, no place, no one that isn't the truth.
There's no escaping reality.
It's everything seen, felt, touched, tasted.
Sometimes gestures occur, sometimes not.
It makes no difference.
So on the one hand, you have Shitao.
You stand before the great iron ox of nothing works.
And in that, we say, the student becomes already enlightened.
Nothing needed.
This is the Buddha's statement of original perfection.
And it's in response to this that Kazon says,
even though he wasn't aware of it,
Yao Shen became a true human being at that moment.
When he realized Shitao's point.
And then the second point,
through the eyebrows and the humorous blinking of the eyes of Master Mao,
that original perfection, that wakefulness beginning to move,
take expression,
refining him into someone fluid, alive,
expressing everywhere, every way,
the father of ineffable mind,
the mother graceful expression of mind.
Is it one or is it two?
And what do you do?
It's not a poem.
It's not out there.
It's not someone else's issue.
Sometimes father, sometimes mother, no difference.
There are teachings in some schools of Buddhism
that have always struck me as really peculiar
that describe training,
Buddhist training,
as kind of sneaking up on reality.
If you go directly,
you know, you're going to,
it's like trying to catch the feather with the fan
or calm the water by,
you know, putting your hand down on it
just makes more waves.
But if you kind of sneak up,
you know,
and from the side,
peek in on reality,
you know,
then you'll see it.
And suddenly awaken.
But it's still an experience.
So what are you going to do?
Yaoshin in this poem,
Yakuza,
for those of you who know the Japanese names,
was an ardent monk, it said.
He got ordained at the age of 16.
And he was a very sensitive scholar of the sutras.
It said that his feel for the teaching
was like someone who could,
you know,
put their hand up
and know the wind,
its current,
its direction,
its strength,
its consequence.
That he was,
he was that
committed and awake
in his intelligence
and his heart.
And a very careful practitioner
of the discipline,
the kind of monos,
the monastic discipline.
There was no other agenda
in his life.
And so whatever form
was given him
with the intention to awaken,
that he would take it up
with that same ardent commitment.
Which is,
you know,
I think in one way
part of what
this lineage is trying
to create in this country.
That capacity
to commit to a form.
You know,
it's like,
sure,
it can be anything.
And because it can be anything,
let's do this.
And really do it thoroughly.
Because we're so used
to not making that commitment.
But even though he was,
you know,
ardent and sensitive
and careful,
he was still in the middle
of a spiritual crisis
by the time he got
to these teachers.
And the crisis was basically,
he felt no direct,
conscious connection
to Buddha nature,
to the essence
of his own mind.
There was still
a sense of distance,
of being a stranger
in this life.
But after having received
this very direct teaching
from these two teachers,
he was cooking.
And he's unusual
in that most
of the traditional stories
contain those
two elements,
the mother and father,
or the killing
and giving life element
in one teacher.
In Yasham's life,
it was embodied
in two distinct teachers.
So he,
after these meetings,
then became the attendant
for a while
of Master Ma,
several years.
And it's said
that after three years
of that,
Master Ma sensed
that something had shifted,
that he was clearer
in what he'd already realized.
And he asked him
about his daily awareness.
And Yasham said,
I'm the snake
that shed its skin.
That only one bright,
clear reality remains.
Like those locust shells
that you find on the tree.
The old body,
all the self-idea
has been released.
Only one bright,
clear reality remains.
But what is that?
What's he doing?
How can you speak
without creating
another locust shell?
Regardless,
Master Ma
said,
joyfully confirms this
to be the refinement
he'd been waiting for.
And that joyfully confirms
is for me,
whenever a phrase like that
appears in colon study,
something that kind of
winces my heart.
You know,
it's a,
I can forget
that joy.
what Bob Thurman
says quite beautifully,
he says,
you know,
it would have been
pretty disturbing
if the Buddha,
you know,
had done all this,
you know,
kind of,
the edge
of what's humanly possible,
mentally,
physically,
spiritually,
had realized
the ultimate nature
of mind
and essence
and expression
and kind of
come back
into the world
and said,
you know,
don't go there.
It's a bummer.
You know,
just,
you know,
stay in samsara
and fight with each other.
You know,
you don't want to know.
But instead,
he said,
this is like
incredible.
It's wondrous.
Where there was
a kind of unfolding
of fathomless,
irrevocable
joy.
So he joyously
confirms
the refinement
he's been waiting for,
proclaiming,
mind essence
now consciously
pervades
all your thoughts
and actions.
And all of these
teachings
are skillful means.
They're for us.
So you take that
with that consciousness.
There's no dimension
in your entire being
where it does not shine.
Go to a sacred mountain
and teach.
Why?
Because mind essence
is inseparable
from all suffering
and aspiring beings.
Because mind essence
is inseparable
from all suffering
and aspiring beings.
In other words,
what he's realized
is not some escape.
It's not some denial.
So the implicit question
is,
what is it
that's been realized?
Master Ma says,
don't hang around
your home monastery
and don't get into
the illusion
of benefiting the world
by staying alone.
Build a big boat.
Carry people
to true mind.
and I was recently
reading the journal
from our affiliate
in New Zealand
and Jinmon apparently
in the archives there
dug up
an old,
old interview
with Mizumi Roshi
that apparently
has never been published.
It was from his first years
of teaching
and it's kind of unclear
who the speakers are
other than Mizumi Roshi,
but it's kind of beautiful
on this particular point.
The interviewer
is asking him
about being in training
with a teacher,
kind of what its intention is,
the dynamic,
how it feels
in a sense
when it's true,
when it's alive,
when it's developed fully.
He says,
could you say a little bit
about your relationship
to Koryu Roshi
and your other teachers
and Mizumi Roshi
who's our Dharma
grandfather here,
for those of you
who don't know,
is also kind of
like Yao Shen,
unusual
in that he had,
he received transmission,
he received
kind of depth,
heart teaching
from a number
of teachers
who received transmission
and so his teaching style
combines
that experience.
So Mizumi Roshi says,
yes,
I can simply say
that this relationship
was an incredible thing
in my father's case,
his father was one
of his teachers,
instead of there being
just the ordinary
father and son relationship,
another kind of affection
or closeness
was involved.
But with Koryu Roshi
and Yasutani Roshi too,
there was a really genuine,
almost exquisite feeling.
This is the sort of affection
or love
I want to develop
in this country.
Even the word sincere
fear is not quite
the right word
to express it
and it's more
even than being
affectionate
and responsible
and eager
and devoted.
So he's,
I felt,
describing the
Mahayana ideal
in terms
that sometimes
are not used.
The love boat
ideal.
So at this point,
Yashan returns
to his root teacher,
to Shittau,
the Iron Mountain,
having realized himself,
having refined it,
it's said,
with Master Ma,
and now returns
to that teacher
whose basic
relationship
with him
was for him
to awaken fully.
And the teacher
is still there
waiting,
you know,
what are you going
to do?
How are you going
to bring it life?
Bring it your life?
And so,
Shittau,
his teacher,
says,
what are you doing?
He's sitting
in the Zendo,
his old teacher,
Zendo,
and his teacher
comes in
and says,
what are you doing?
Yashan says,
nothing at all.
And his teacher says,
then you're sitting
in idleness.
Boom.
Yashan says,
sitting in idleness
would be doing something.
Shittau says,
well,
what kind of nothing
are you doing?
This is the radical
transmission.
Yashan says,
not even all the sages
from human history
can say.
Shittau says,
because speaking's
not related to it.
Yashan says,
neither is keeping
silent related to it.
And Shittau says,
not even room
for a needle
to enter.
Yashan says,
planting flowers
on a smooth river
stone.
What are you doing?
Doing nothing.
Can't be done.
Nice idea.
Is it real?
Or is there
some trace?
Are you watching
yourself doing
nothing?
Are you aware
of yourself doing
nothing?
Or is it intimate?
No watcher.
And Daito,
she used to often
comment on people
coming in and
reporting that they
had experienced
samadhi.
Body and mind
fell away.
There was no
witness.
and he would
say,
how do you
know?
What are you
doing?
Because speaking
is not related
to it.
That's why
sages can't
say anything
about it.
No relation.
Neither is
keeping silent
related to it.
No duality.
But what
are they doing?
What does it
have to do
with leaving
Lizendo?
Getting in a
canoe,
putting on
your hiking
boots,
driving where
you need to
drive,
working where
you need to
work,
loving who
you need to
love?
Shita says,
not even room
for a needle
to enter.
It's complete.
There's no gap.
There's no room
there's no room
for even
a needle.
That or she
wants to make
t-shirts that
say no gap
in response to
the gap.
T-shirts.
planting flowers
on a smooth
river stone.
It's impossible.
You can't put
roots into a
stone.
You can't
get there.
You can't do
it.
It can't be
done.
And yet,
there's this
planting of
flowers.
Les Hickson
who's probably
our most
exuberant
dharma cousin
comments on
this in a
way that's
kind of nice.
He says,
usually one
master acts
as both
father and
mother wielding
both life-taking
and life-giving
swords.
In this
case, the
role was
taken by two
teachers.
As a result,
Yao Shen's
considered by
Kaizan to
be the
most marvelous
among the
ancient teachers
in his
teaching skill
because he
had honed
both edges
so beautifully.
Yao Shen
brings forth
several
incomparably
great beings,
both monastics
and lay
persons,
from his
small, spare,
rigorous monastery.
And it's
true.
Yao Shen
was the
teacher of
Ongan,
who was the
teacher of
Tozan,
who was the
teacher of
Sozan.
Sozan and
Tozan are the
founders of the
Soto School.
It's part of what
we do here.
They have
incredible impact
on human life
throughout history.
He was the
teacher of
Dogo,
who was the
teacher of
Sikiso.
He's in a
very small
environment.
He touched
the whole
bowl of
Jell-O,
as they
say.
Some say
that his
austere
simplicity
of life
is what
limited
his
students,
but really
was the
impenetrability
of his
teaching.
One mind
has no
eyes or
ears,
he used
to comment
to his
disciples.
Such
austerity
is much
harder to
endure
than cold,
sleeplessness,
hunger.
Not many
flowers can
put down
roots into
pure stone,
but their
blossoms are
the most
amazing ones.
So not
being able
to find
a place
to enter
can feel
very frustrating.
And part
of what
practice asks
us to do
is to
examine
directly
our
relationship
to the
impossible,
to not
avoid it,
to really
see.
the
interviewer
asked
Mizumi
Roshi
about
this
kind of
cooking
process,
this
encountering
of the
stone.
And he
says that
he had
been reading
something by
D.T.
Suzuki
that morning.
said that
Suzuki
said that
the crisis
in which
transformation
or insight
is made
possible is
like boiling
oil over
a blazing
fire.
The interviewer
then says
that sounds a
little dramatic,
but there is
this crisis
in one form
or another
in all
traditions
that precedes
enlightenment,
certainly in the
Buddha's own life,
is that part
of the natural
flowering.
And then Roshi
says,
in a way
there is a
crisis,
but it seems
to me crisis
is a little
too strong
a term.
It's not
necessary
to have
a crisis,
but instead
a total
devotion
of the heart
to the way.
In the
Soto School
we would
rather emphasize
the natural
flowering
than having
a crisis
of pushing
yourself
into a
hard position
where you
have to
leap out
from ordinary
happenings.
It's better
to have a
strong,
definite
faith
in yourself,
to identify
yourself
with Zazen,
with wisdom
itself.
Then somehow,
then somehow,
we go on
and when
the right
time comes
by any
chance,
that awareness
just takes
place,
so to speak.
Or rather,
you are
suddenly,
totally
convinced
of what
is true.
And then he
refers to
something the
interviewer had
mentioned earlier.
He says,
you mentioned
humor,
and that is
a kind of
natural occurrence
too,
since truth
is such an
obvious,
thing.
This whole
way of
working
is
part of
this particular
cluster of
teachers at
that time.
Many of us
have dealt
in our
formal
Cohen study
with the
piece on
the visiting
monk coming
to Master
Ma,
Basso's
monastery,
who's
apparently
not always
regarded as
having a
gentler
mountain.
So this
visiting monk
comes to
Master Ma
and says,
beyond all
the propositions
and all the
negations
about reality,
and that's
that via
negativa,
it's not
this and
it's not
that,
and it's
not going
suddenly,
and it's
not going
gradually,
it's not
absolute,
and it's
not relative,
it's beyond
all that
negation,
and beyond
all the
constructions
of expressed
truth,
please show
me the
direct
meaning
of
Bodhidharma
arriving in
the country,
or the
meaning of
Buddhism,
meaning of
truth,
and
Matsu says,
I just
don't feel
like explaining
it today,
go ask
the head
monk,
this visiting
monk,
go find
the head
monk,
and says,
can you
show me
this direct
pointing to
the meaning
of Buddhism,
and the
head monk
says,
God,
I've got a
headache today,
why don't
you go ask
the cook,
and the
man's
wanders
through the
monastery,
comes to
the kitchen,
finds the
cook,
and says,
okay,
I'm looking
for direct
pointing at
the meaning
of Buddhism,
can you
do this,
and the
cook says,
I used
to know
that,
I used
to know
it,
but I've
forgotten,
but I do
make a
really good
soup,
would you
like some
soup,
and the
monk says,
no,
your head
monk's
a sick
man,
your cook
can't even
think anymore,
he has
some Alzheimer's
thing,
what kind of
monastery is
this,
and he
leaps,
and Father
Ken in
Basa then
says,
the head
monk's head
is white,
and the cook's
head is black,
and the
monk,
having now
missed
five direct
presentations
of the
meaning of
Buddhism,
kind of
wanders off
still looking
for it,
and Father
Kennedy,
another of
our Dharma
cousins,
writes in
his recent
book,
he says he
likes to
imagine later
that evening
after dinner,
the three of
them are
sitting around
sipping a
little rice
wine,
and the
head monk
says to
Basa,
so did
that visiting
monk find
the meaning
of Buddhism?
Basa says,
I don't
think so,
he seemed
very disappointed
with us,
and the
cook says,
yeah,
and he
didn't even
taste the
soup.
How do
we stay
on target?
This is
my segue
to Kudo
weekend
without
knowing,
and thus
being apart
from the
target,
without
disbanding
all
motivation,
is how
can we
not be
motivated?
Even
in the
statement of
realization,
go teach,
Basa says,
ultimate
truth is
not a
part from
those who
are suffering.
How can
we not be
motivated?
we want
to put
an end
to our
spiritual
crisis,
that sense
of being
a stranger,
of being
apart.
Most of
us feel,
I've
discovered,
that we're
somehow unique
in that
motivation.
Everybody
else is
really part
of this
one thing,
and somehow
we're
outside.
they all
know what's
going on,
they all
love each
other,
and somehow
we're just
like this
chink that
arrived from
outer space,
you know,
and it's
foreign matter
in the body
of being.
And so we
look for it
and we want
to enter.
another.
But we
miss it
because we
keep waiting
for it to
be explained.
We want
an answer.
and we
confuse that
answer for
what we're
really seeking.
We want
to live in
communion.
We want
to be
completely
at home.
And yet
our conditioning
is to
step back,
pick up
the pack
of everything
we understand
that has
in some
way made
us feel
moderately
safe,
or at
least
familiar
with our
shit,
and carry
it with
us.
And because
it's so
heavy,
the cocks
are back
and we
can't see
the step
that's right
in front
of us.
All of
the teachers
through
antiquity
have
basically
said
one
thing.
Put
down the
pack,
sit
down,
trust
yourself.
trust
yourself
as
wisdom
itself.
You want
direct
experience
of reality,
experience
reality.
Mary Oliver
who
I've
been
Mary Oliver
to me
is a
poet who
feels like
someone who
is able
to hold
the fire
fly for
a moment
without
killing it.
She's able
to present
that wonder
with a
kind of
grace that's
unusual.
And I
wanted to
read a
poem that
she writes
similar to
this teaching.
she calls
it wild
geese
and begins
you don't
have to
be good.
You don't
have to
walk on
your knees
for a
hundred miles
through the
desert
repenting.
You only
have to
let the
soft animal
of your
body
love what
it loves.
Tell me
about your
despair
and I
will tell
you mine.
Meanwhile
the world
goes on.
Meanwhile
the sun
and the
clear pebbles
of the
rain are
moving across
the landscapes
over the
prairies
and the
deep trees
the mountains
and the
rivers.
Meanwhile
the wild
geese
high in
the clean
blue air
are heading
home again.
Whoever
you are
no matter
how lonely
the world
offers itself
to your
imagination
calls to
you like
wild geese
harsh and
exciting
over and
over
announcing
your place
as a
great truth.
As we
end this
time of
training together
this weekend
this morning
of sitting
I'd like
to encourage
all of us
to really
go
to that
question
to face
what seems
impossible
to ask
the question
as deeply
as clearly
as sincerely
as you can
and to be
willing
to encounter
that stone
because
through that
the flower
blossoms
blossoms
never been
not
present
it's nothing
other than
our life
but what
will you do
to ask
the question
is the
stupidest
thing
because it
pulls back
and yet
to not
ask
is to
sit in
idleness
without
clarity
so what
will you
do
what will
each of
us do
at the
very least
we should
not ignore
the possibility
of that
flowering
please take
care
of all
the ten
thousand
things
dogan
said
to study
the mind
to really
ask
is to
study
the self
and to
study the
self
is to
forget
the self
and to
forget
the self
is to
be
right
so
