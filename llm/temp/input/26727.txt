The Book of Equanimity, Case 86, Rinzai's Great Enlightenment.
Even with a head of bronze, a forehead of iron, the eyes of a god, the pupils of a dragon,
the beak of an eagle, the jowls of a fish, the heart of a bear, and the guts of a leopard.
Under the diamond sword, no plan is accepted and no measurement is possible.
Why does it have to be like this?
The main case.
Rinzai asked Obaku, what is the true essential great meaning of the Buddha's teaching?
Obaku immediately hit him.
This happened three times.
Then Rinzai left Obaku and visited Daegu.
Daegu asked, where have you come from?
Rinzai said, from Obaku.
Daegu said, what did Obaku say?
Rinzai said, three times I asked him about the truly essential great meaning of the Buddha's teaching
and three times I was beaten with a stick.
I don't know if I had any fault or not.
Daegu said, Obaku was so kind.
He did his utmost for you and still you come and ask if there was any fault or not.
At this, Rinzai was greatly enlightened.
The verse.
Nine colored phoenix, a thousand mile colt.
The wind of reality crosses the pipes.
The spiritual works goes into action.
Coming on directly, the flying lightning is swift.
When the clouds of illusion break, the sun is alone.
It grabs the tiger's whiskers.
Do you see it or not?
This is a brave and powerful person of great stature.
During this weekend, for those of you that are just here for today,
we had two workshops.
One was a workshop called The Laughing Buddha
by a professor from, I can't remember,
Adolphus Collins, who wrote a book called The Laughing Buddha.
And in it, he was dealing with humor and Zen.
And also, there was another workshop by Barry Weiss,
a shakuhachi teacher on the shakuhachi.
And on Thursday of this week,
we had a mundo, a question and answer session,
where we dealt with some of the things that were in that book,
The Laughing Buddha.
And a few observations that I had made
with regard to the difference between
the humor as it's present in the Soto school
and humor as it's present in the Rinzai school of Zen,
both of which are part of the teachings here
at Zen Mount Monastery.
And during that question and answer session,
I told a little story about Rinzai's enlightenment.
I don't think I've ever dealt with it as a koan.
It's one of the koans in the Book of Equanimity.
So I thought today I would go a little bit further into that
and maybe help you appreciate where the humor is
and where it is not.
And a lot of what we take as humor in Zen
from the point of view of the teacher and the teachings,
it's not funny.
And what we miss as the humor in Zen
from the point of view of the teacher and the teachings
is usually missed by people who are looking at it superficially.
I mentioned during that talk that he points out
that the beginning of humor in Buddhism
is when Shakyamuni Buddha held up a flower
and twirled it in Mayakaya Shapa
in the assembly of 2,000 smiled.
He said, that's the beginning of humor.
And to me, the beginning of the humor
is not the smile of Mayakaya Shapa,
but the fact that this yellow-faced old teacher
ripped off 2,000 other people in that assembly,
that every one of them was a Buddha.
That was the funny part of it.
And yet he singled out Mayakaya Shapa.
And the inevitable question that must be asked is,
what if Mayakaya Shapa hadn't smiled?
What would have happened?
Or what if everybody had smiled?
Would he have given it to 2,000 people?
So I don't think the smile really has anything to do with it.
And the same with this.
When you really look at this,
it kind of is a little bit like
one of the Three Stooges routines
or the Marx Brothers routines.
That's what's happening on the surface.
Underneath, there's a teaching going on.
And that's the key to appreciating what's going on.
And there is humor,
but not where we normally kind of think it is.
In this preface to the assembly,
he says,
even with a head of bronze,
an iron forehead,
the eyes of a god,
the eyeball of a dragon,
the falcon beak,
the shark jaw,
bare heart,
leopard's liver,
under the diamond sword,
no plans accepted
and no measurement is possible.
Why is it so?
No plan is accepted
and no measurement is possible.
The diamond sword,
is the sword of Manjushri.
Manjushri Bodhisattva.
It's the sword that kills
and the sword that gives life.
And that killing
has got to do with taking away
everything that we hold on to.
And the giving life
is nourishing,
positive,
supportive.
The sword has both capabilities
and is used sometimes for one purpose
and sometimes for another purpose.
And exactly there,
in terms of planning,
in terms of measurement,
seems to be the biggest problems
that most of us run into.
Inevitably,
we get down to that
in the face-to-face teaching.
There's nothing wrong with plans.
The problem is
is when we
attach to them
once we've made them
and we lose
all of our freedom
in doing so.
We lose the flexibility.
There's nothing wrong
with measurement,
evaluation,
but when you attach to it
is when it becomes a problem.
People are constantly
measuring themselves.
That's the biggest
and most difficult thing
to let go of
in the beginning of Zen practice.
The witness.
Now I'm doing it good.
Now I'm doing it poorly.
So-and-so is sitting better than I am.
When will I be enlightened?
Now I'm enlightened.
All of those measurements
are a waste of time.
It doesn't mean anything.
And we get stuck in it
and we create barrier after barrier
for ourselves.
So long as that witness
is reflecting on
what you're doing
in your zazen,
what you're doing
is witnessing.
It's not yet falling away
of body and mind.
And inevitably
I run into people
who come in and tell me
how body and mind
fell away.
I say,
how do you know?
You can't know
unless there's a witness.
And what this is about,
what the laughing Buddha
is really about,
what the weekend
of Shakuhachi
is really about,
what our life
is really about,
is whole body
and mind intimacy.
That means no separation.
That means seeing form
with the whole body
and mind.
That means hearing sound
with the whole body
and mind.
One of the problems
with planning
and measurement
is that it
involves expectation.
And one of the
characteristics
of expectation
is usually
it never turns out
like you expect.
So don't expect.
Take it as it comes.
Allow it to be
as it is.
what that means
is to trust.
To trust yourself.
And to trust yourself
in its most
perfect sense
means no expectation.
It means having
given yourself
permission to be
the way you are.
It means having
given yourself
permission
to succeed
or to fail.
That's very empowering.
And it's very liberating.
Someone that trusts
themselves
is free.
Now in this corn
Rinzai asked
Obaku
what is the
ultimate meaning
of Buddhism
at that Obaku
hit him.
This happened
three times.
We need to
appreciate
that what's going
on in this corn
is
a great
religious
occurrence.
I mean this
event
with Rinzai
and Obaku
is precisely
as important
as the event
that took place
with St.
Teresa of Avila
in her realization
or St.
John of the Cross
in the
revelation
of
Mary Baker
Eddy
in the
experience
of Luther
or Moses.
These are
great
historical
religious
events
events
that had to
do with the
transformation
of the lives
of these people.
And so it is
with Rinzai.
And usually
these events
tend to be
very, very
sober
and
not very funny
usually.
And this
Rinzai experience
seems to have
a different
kind of
dimension
the surface
of which
appears
to be
humorous.
And actually
what happened
to appreciate
the koan
better
the koan
is the
single event
kind of
stripped
of all
of the
details.
When you
hear all
of the
details
it helps
to appreciate
the whole
thing.
Rinzai
was in
the assembly
of monks
in the
monastery
of the
great
master
Obaku.
Obaku
is part
of the
lineage
that
received
the
transmission
from
Yakujo
and
Yakujo
in turn
received it
from
Baso
or
Matsu.
And
the Rinzai
lineage
is something
that continued
right down
to this
time
and this
place.
And he
had been
in that
one of the
things about
Obaku
is he was
kind of a
fierce
character.
In order to
appreciate how
fierce you have
to understand
that he was
seven feet
tall in a
country where
most people
were five,
five and a
half feet
tall.
This guy
was a
giant.
And on
top of
which he
had this
big callous
lump in
the middle
of his
forehead that
came from
bowing.
Rinzai came
to this
monastery and
practiced
there for
three years.
never went
to
doksan.
Never
went face
to face
with his
teacher.
And one
day the
head monk
Sancho said
to him,
how long
have you
been here?
And
Rinzai said,
I've been
here three
years.
He says,
have you
ever asked
for instruction?
And he
said no.
Sometimes
that's a
way of
evading the
issue.
avoid
confrontation,
just sit
there and
look good,
don't shake
the tree or
don't stir
the pot.
Sometimes
it's fear
that does
it.
Sometimes
it's
understanding
that does
it.
And it's
never been
made clear
what was
going on
with Rinzai.
Why does
he spend
three years
in a
monastery
and not
go to
interview?
And more
so than
even that,
it's
rather
surprising
that they
let him
get away
with it
for three
years.
I mean,
I can
see them
letting him
get away
with it
for a
while.
But after
a while,
they usually
nail you.
I remember
when I
first went
to L.A.,
I couldn't
stand the
services that
they did.
I had been
training in a
Rinzai monastery
and the
services were
very,
very few.
And even
those I
couldn't
stand.
Then I
went to
Los Angeles
and it
seemed like
every time I
turned around
it was another
service.
And
so I
started this
process of
cutting out
the back
door as
soon as the
den show
started.
And I
figured I
was making
up for it,
you know,
in my
sitting,
in my
work,
and the
other
things I
did.
I just
didn't
want to
do
service.
And of
course,
what I
was
dealing
with is
my
Catholic
upbringing
and my
reaction
to that.
So this
was a
kind of
justification.
So long
as I
sit better
than anybody
else,
if I
sneak out
the side
door,
nobody
will mind.
And I
figured nobody
would notice
me.
At that
time,
there were
hundreds of
people there
and I
figured,
you know,
who's going
to notice
me sneaking
out the
side door?
Well,
everybody,
everybody
knew it.
Everybody
kind of
poke each
out,
there goes
Taito.
And the
head monk
was going
to grab
me,
but Roshi
said,
let him
go.
And so
every time
there was
service,
there I'd
go out
the side
door,
everybody
would see
it,
I thought
I was
invisible,
and the
teacher let
it go.
That went
on for
maybe two
months,
and finally
they nailed
me.
That's a
whole other
story.
So he
never asked
for instructions.
He said,
I don't
know what
to ask.
And the
head monk
says,
well,
why don't
you go
and ask
him,
just ask
him what's
the
cardinal
principle
of the
Buddha
Dharma
is.
Nothing
much.
So,
being a
good monk,
Rinzai
went in.
And before
he had
even finished
speaking,
you know,
he said,
I've just
come in
here to
ask you,
what's the
cardinal
principle of
pow!
All
Obaku
slugged
him.
So he
gets up
and he
left and
he went
back and
he's sitting
there.
And the
head monk
comes over
and says,
how did
it go?
And he
said,
well,
before I
even finished
talking,
he hit me.
I don't
understand.
He said,
then go ask
him again.
Be persistent.
So Rinzai
gets up and
goes back in,
asks the
same question
again before
it's out of
his mouth,
pow!
hits him.
He comes
back in and
he sits
down.
Again,
the head
monk came,
asked him.
He said,
he hit me
again.
He says,
be persistent.
Go ask
him again.
Third time
he went
in,
pow!
He came
out.
He said
to the
head monk,
I'm
leaving.
He says,
it was
very kind
of you
to send
me to
the
master.
Three
times I
asked him
and three
times I
was hit.
I
regret
that
some
obstruction
caused
my own
past
karma
prevents
me
from
grasping
his
profound
meaning
so I'm
going away
for a while.
So the
head monk
who was a
wonderful
grandmother,
I mean,
a good head
monk should be
a good
grandmother.
He really,
really wanted
this person
to see it,
this Rinzai
to see it.
He said,
well,
if you're
going to go
away,
you should
take leave
of the
teacher,
you shouldn't
just walk
out.
So go
back,
ask him,
tell him
that you're
going.
And before
Rinzai got
to the
master,
the head
monk went
to him
and said,
there's a
young man,
the one
that's been
questioning
you,
I think
there's
something
very special
about him.
If he
comes in
to take
his leave,
please handle
him expediently.
In the
future,
with training,
he's sure
to become
a great
tree which
will provide
cool shade
for the
people of
the world.
So then
comes
Rinzai
to take
his leave
and Obaku
said,
you shouldn't
go anywhere
else other
than to
Daigou's
place by
the river.
He should
have explained
things for
you.
Now,
Daigou,
very little
is known
about Daigou.
Daigou
was a
hermit
living alone
in the
mountains
and he
was a
student of
Rinzai.
It's not
even clear
whether or
not he
had received
the transmission
from Rinzai
but clearly
he was
clear and
he was a
teacher.
So Rinzai
follows those
instructions and
goes to
Daigou's
temple.
Actually,
Obaku missed
the opportunity
to hit him
again.
He let him
get away
with it.
So he
gets to
Daigou and
Daigou says,
where have
you come
from?
He says,
I've come
from Obaku's
place.
What did
Obaku have
to say?
He said
Daigou.
Well,
three times
I asked
him just
what's the
cardinal
principle of
Buddha Dharma
and three
times he
hit me.
I don't
know whether
I was at
fault or
not.
Daigou
should have
hit him
but he
didn't.
At those
words,
I don't
know if
I was at
fault or
not and
Daigou
said,
oh,
Baku is
such a
grandmother
that he's
utterly
exhausted
himself with
your troubles
and now
you've come
here asking
whether you're
at fault or
not.
And at
these words
Rinzai
attained great
enlightenment.
What did
he see?
And he
said,
ah,
there isn't
so much
to Obaku's
Buddha Dharma.
Daigou
grabbed him
and said,
you bed
wetting
little devil,
you just
finished asking
whether you're
at fault or
not and
now you
say there
isn't so
much to
Obaku's
Buddha Dharma.
What did
you see?
Speak,
Speak.
And at
that,
Rinzai
hit
Daigou
three times
on the
side and
shoved
him away.
And Daigou
said,
Obaku is
your teacher.
It's none
of my
business.
Go back
to him.
So,
Rinzai
left Daigou
and goes
back to
Obaku.
Obaku
saw him
coming and
said,
what a
fellow,
coming and
going,
coming and
going.
When will
it end?
And then
Rinzai
said,
it's all
due to
your
grandmotherly
kindness,
Rinzai
said,
and then
presented a
customary
gift and
stood waiting.
Where have
you been,
said Obaku?
Well,
recently you
did me the
favor of
sending me
to see
Daigou,
said Rinzai.
What did
Daigou have
to say,
asked Obaku.
Rinzai told
him what
had happened.
Obaku
said,
how I'd
like to
get my
hands on
that fellow
and give
him a
good dose
of my
stick.
And Rinzai
said,
why say
you'd like
to?
Take it
right now.
Bam!
And he
hit Obaku.
Obaku
said,
you lunatic
coming back
here and
pulling the
tiger's
whiskers.
And Rinzai's
answer to
that was,
a great
shout.
Attendant,
Obaku
calls out,
get this
lunatic
out of
here and
take him
to the
monk's
hall.
And Rinzai
then took
his place
in the
assembly and
became the
successor,
the most
important
successor of
Master Obaku.
Well,
seems like
the whole
thing is
centered about
this hitting.
And,
you know,
people wonder
about
Zen
training.
The tendency
is that
there are
lots of
stories about
this hitting
and what's
going on.
What's the
hitting all
about?
Clearly
there's
something going
on there.
And although
people think
that that's
one of the
characteristics of
Zen,
it's not.
Any more
than hitting
is the
characteristic
of American
comedy,
for example.
There was
a period
of time
when,
you know,
the Three
Stooges
were popular,
Avon and
Costello was
popular,
and there
was a lot
of this
hitting and
falling down
and ridiculous
kind of
comedy that
people really
liked.
But that
period was
15 years,
20 years,
and then it
passed,
and the comedy
is taken on
another dimension.
And it's the
same with
the hitting.
There was a
period of time
in Zen
training where
that was a
very important
aspect of
particularly
this school.
And then
it faded.
I mean,
you don't
find those
accounts of
hitting in
the case of
Dogen,
for example,
or Tozan,
or some of
the other
masters.
In fact,
the enlightenment
experience of
Tozan,
the other
lineage,
is quite
different than
this enlightenment
experience of
Rinzai.
And it's a
bit more
sober or
somber than
the Rinzai
transmission to
master Rinzai.
So what's
going on?
He asks,
what's the
meaning of the
Buddha Dharma
and Obaku
hit him?
He asked
it three
times and
three times
he got
hit.
I mean,
actually the
old man was
getting redundant.
But was
this the
answer?
Was the
answer to
hit?
There's,
you know,
the classic
example of
Toksan,
old Toksan.
If a monk
answered a
question affirmatively,
he would give
them 30 blows
of his stick.
if they
answered
negatively,
he would
give them
30 blows
of his
stick.
If he
asked them
neither
affirmatively or
negatively,
30 blows
of the
stick.
If they
didn't answer,
30 blows
of the
stick.
So these
monks didn't
even want to
go in the
room with
this guy.
I mean,
there's nothing
you could do
without 30
blows of his
stick.
what was
that about?
I think
that one of
the critical
things is
until you
felt the
sting of
the question,
you won't
appreciate the
sting of
the answer.
So is
being hit
the answer?
And if so,
where is its
meaning?
Well, I can
tell you right
off, save you
a lot of
time, there's
no meaning
whatsoever.
So don't
even waste
your time
looking for
it.
The same
with the
people working
on moo or
the sound
of one
hand clapping.
There is
no meaning
whatsoever
to moo.
So don't
come with
meanings.
And that
hit is not
punishment.
It's not
anger.
It has
nothing to do
with meaning.
It's not
funny.
It wasn't
intended to be
funny.
It wasn't
the kind of
thing that
was going
on in
the three
stooges
when Moe
hits Curly
in the head
and he
makes a
funny sound
and Larry
turns around
and hits
him in the
head or
steps on
his foot
and those
funny sounds
happen.
This is not
what was
going on
here.
This was
serious
stuff.
And I've
often thought
about that
hitting,
happening in
an American
monastery.
Can you
imagine how
many lawsuits
we have?
That's what
we do.
But the
hitting needs
to be also
appreciated not
only as
something that's
got to do with
the teaching but
also as an
act of
compassion.
I remember
the first time I
walked into a
Zen monastery and
I'm sitting there
hating the whole
thing and
getting more and
more angry because
of my own
pain.
Of course I
didn't realize
that.
I was getting
angry because
of all of the
stuff that was
going on in the
place that was
wrong.
And next thing I
know this guy
gets up with a
stick and he's
walking up and
down the aisles
hitting people with
it and nobody,
we do a nice
long explanation
here about
Kiyosaku,
there nobody
explained.
And I grew up
in the streets,
you know,
in a ghetto.
and nobody
hits me.
And this guy
is walking down
the aisle getting
closer and closer
with this stick and
I knew there was
going to be a
fight, maybe the
first fight in the
Buddhist monastery but
if he took that
stick to me I was
going to deck him.
And not only that,
I was going to go
after the old man
and deck him too.
And then I was
going to kick over
the Buddha image and
there I sat with
all of this, you
know, trying to be
peaceful.
Of course I didn't
know you had to
ask for it before
they used it so
the guy walked
right by me,
you know, but
just in that two
or three minutes
that it took him
to slowly come up
the aisle I was
in a frenzy that
you wouldn't believe
and then he went
by.
It's got nothing
to do that
hitting with the
same kind of
thing that happens
for example
with Catholic
monks use
self-flagellation
Benedictines.
I don't know if
they still do it
but they still
wear the rope
that rope that
they wear on
their side with
the knots on it
that's what that's
for, to beat
yourself with it.
But self-flagellation
is not the same
what's going on.
That has to do
with feeling the
pain and the
suffering of Christ.
That's not what
Obaku was doing.
He wasn't trying
to inflict suffering
on him.
He was trying to
get him to see
something.
What was it
that he saw?
What was it
that
Obaku was
giving him?
In the
commentary on
this cone
it says the
treasury of the
eye of the
true teaching
perished in the
blind donkey.
Obaku was
too kind.
Daigou was
too talkative.
These are our
three stooges in
this little event
here.
The treasury of
the eye of the
true teaching
I told you about
that.
Rinzai, after he
became a master
and was teaching
for many, many
years, sooner or
later, of course,
we all get old
and it's time to
leave this world.
So there was
Rinzai.
He's lying there
and all his
disciples are
gathered around
him and he
looks up at
his primary
disciple, the
one that's
going to carry
the teachings
on, Sancho
I believe it
was, and he
looks up at
Sancho and he
said, please
don't let my
dharma be
extinguished.
And Sancho
said, how
could I let
your dharma be
extinguished?
Which was a
wonderful response
to that question.
Indeed, how
can you?
That's why it's
another kind of a
joke, you know,
we do a
Hakurasan
service to
protect the
imperishable
dharma.
It reaches
everywhere.
Where will it
go?
Where did it
come from?
So how could
it possibly be
extinguished?
Like this very
life itself,
it's unborn.
Like this very
life itself,
it's
unextinguishable.
Life is the
unborn.
Death is the
unextinguished.
And so he
said, how
could I let
your dharma be
extinguished?
And Rinzai says,
well, many years
from now when
someone asks you
what's the
teachings of
Master Rinzai,
what will you
tell them?
And Sancho
says,
which was one
of the key
characteristics of
all the years
of teaching of
Rinzai, the
shout.
The shout was
the answer to
what is the
Buddha.
The shout was
the answer to
what is the
truth.
The shout was
the answer to
all of the
questions.
Just like the
30 blows of
Toksan was the
answer, or the
finger of Gutai
was the answer.
For Rinzai, it
was the shout.
And so when he
asked, what will
you tell him?
And Sancho
shouted, he
looked him
right in the
eye and said,
to think, my
true Dharma will
be extinguished
with this blind
ass.
And he died.
But what he
was doing was
approving.
What the old
hermit was doing
when he called
him a bedwetting
little devil was
approving.
When Rinzai
came back to
meet Obaku
and Obaku
said, what
happened?
And he told
him the story
and he said,
Daigu is too
talkative.
Wait till I
see him.
I'm going to
give him a
beating.
And Rinzai
said, why
wait?
And he
hit him.
Obaku's
response was
to laugh.
That laugh
was at once
an approval
and an
expression of
joy.
an expression
of joy
that probably
for a teacher
is more
important than
their own
experience.
To see
one of their
disciples get
it.
To see
one of their
disciples connect
with this
incredible Dharma.
That's what he
was expressing.
That laughter
was the laughter
of a parent
that sees
their child
made it.
And then
finally,
he follows
that with
this lunatic
comes to
grab the
tiger's
whiskers.
Also,
approval.
It's an
expression of
his approval
of his
freedom.
what was
it that
he saw
that allowed
such a
transformation
to take
place?
Here for
three years
he's sitting
in the
corner of
the
zendo,
afraid to
go into
doksan,
and now
he comes
and socks
the old
man in
the head.
And what
kind of a
teaching is
that?
That you
run around
hitting
people?
You better
be sure
what you're
doing before
you come
in there
and hit
me.
I'm still
a street
kid.
Later,
Isan said
to
Kyozan,
did Rinzai
get
Daigou's
power
or
Obaku's
power?
Who did
he really
succeed?
Who brought
him to
enlightenment?
Was it?
Keep in
mind
what
happened
in that
encounter.
He hit
him
three times.
He hit
the old
hermit monk
three times.
Obaku
hit him
three times.
Obaku
said,
I'd like
to hit
the monk.
Rinzai
hit him.
Why wait?
What he
was doing
was revealing
the identity
of those
three.
Intimacy.
Whole
body and
mind
intimacy.
Single
thought
separates
you by
a hundred
thousand
miles.
Single
thought,
heaven and
earth are
separated.
There's a
little poem
that someone
made about,
there was a
eulogy poem
actually for
Daigou.
It said,
bitter and
harsh,
biting like
a dog.
He opened
the Rinzai
of the
north and
made him
a great
tree.
He pushed
Uman over
the precipice
cliff.
His words
were like
dry firewood.
His reason
cannot be
systematized.
Later,
Rinzai said
to an
assembly,
at my
late teacher's
place,
I asked
about the
ultimate
meaning of
Buddhism
three times,
and three
times I was
beaten.
It was
like being
brushed with
a branch
of mugwort.
Right now
I'm thinking
of another
beating.
Who can
do it
for me?
At that
point,
a certain
monk came
forward and
said,
I'll do
it.
Rinzai
held up
his stick
to hand
it to
him,
and as
the monk
reached for
it,
Rinzai
hit him.
Another
master
said of
this,
Rinzai's
letting go
was a bit
dangerous,
but he
gathers in
exceedingly
fast.
I started
explaining to
you before
that statement
the treasury
of the eye
of the true
teaching
perished in
the blind
donkey.
Obaku
was too
kind,
Daigou
too
talkative.
Those are
three words
of praise
for those
three men.
The true
teaching
perishing
in the
hands of
the blind
donkey
was Rinzai's
approval of
his successor.
Obaku
was too
kind,
incredibly
kind.
The kind
of kindness
that a
parent has
for a
child.
And I'm
not talking
about
child molesting
and child
beating.
I'm talking
about a
spanking.
And there
are times
that a
spanking
works,
that it's
important.
I think
I've only
done it
twice in
raising my
kids.
The older
ones,
actually.
The younger
one, I
don't think
has ever
had one.
That's
his problem.
But my
two older
sons, who
are now,
one is
36 and
one is
34.
When they
were 8
and 10,
we had a
pond near
the house.
And one
fall, we
had this
freeze that
lasted for a
few days, and
the surface of
the pond
froze.
And then it
snowed a
little bit, and
it was covered
with snow, but
the ice was
thin.
So they're out
playing in the
snow, and I
said to them,
don't go to
the pond.
It's dangerous.
Stay off the
surface of the
pond until I
say it's
okay.
It's going
to take a
couple of
months yet.
Half hour
later, I
looked out
the window.
They were
on the
pond.
Luckily, they
were light
enough that
the ice
supported
them.
And I
appeared, and
I immediately
gave them a
good wallop on
the behind,
the both of
them, and I
wanted them to
remember that
that was a
life and
death matter.
And for a
life and
death matter, I
am willing to
whack his
behind.
Of course,
during those
days, it
was like
late 60s.
When were
they born?
Well, it was
35 years ago.
In those days,
all the
psychologists
said, you
got to not
do this to
kids.
And they
were convinced
my kids
would be
brainwarped and
destroyed because
of that
spanking.
But that
spanking was
one of love
and one of
concern, not
one of
anger.
It was one
of deep
concern.
And I
think the
same thing
is going
on with a
cat and
a kitten.
There are
times that
this communicates
directly and
immediately
something that
can't be
talked about,
that's beyond
the words and
ideas.
in the
verse, the
nine-colored
phoenix, a
thousand-mile
colt, the
wind of
reality crosses
the pipes, the
spiritual works
goes into
action.
Coming on
directly, the
flying lightning
is swift.
When the
clouds of
illusion break,
the sun is
alone.
He grabs
the tiger's
whiskers.
Do you see
it or not?
This is a
brave and
powerful person
of great
stature.
That first
one about
the phoenix,
there's a
saying that
phoenix have
nine features.
One is that
it gives back
life.
Two is that
its mind
accords with
balance, the
balance of
nature.
Three, that
its ears hear
well.
Four, that
its tongue is
curled when
extended.
Five, it
has lustrous
color.
Six, it's
red.
Seven, it's
sharp talons.
Eight, it
has a loud
cry.
Nine, it
has a door
in its belly.
Don't ask me
why.
This is all
listed in the
pectoral of
auspicious
signs.
And he
refers to
that in
his poem.
The
statement on
the wind
of reality
crosses the
pipes, the
wind of
reality.
He makes
reference to
bamboo flute
basically.
He says it's
like the
space between
heaven and
earth is
like a
bamboo flute.
The
bamboo flute is
bottomless.
it has
several holes.
It's like a
lute in a
dulcimer.
Though they
have a
wonderful sound
without excellent
fingering it
can't come
out.
There it
is.
The whole
thing.
But if you
don't know how
to use it,
it doesn't
make the
beautiful sound.
And so it
is with all
of us.
All sentient
beings, perfect
and complete,
lacking nothing.
If you
don't know
about that,
if you
haven't
examined
yourself,
if you
haven't
gotten beyond
the layers
and layers
of conditioning
that separates
you from
your true
self and
never get
to know
that, you
go to
your death
thinking that
there's
something wrong,
thinking that
you've missed
something,
thinking that
you should
have attained
something that
you didn't.
It's all
there.
The life of
each one of
us, just
as it is,
is the life
of a
Buddha.
Buddha.
Buddha, but
if you
don't see
it, you
can't use
it.
I've talked
longer than
I intended
to.
Please
forgive me,
I like this
coin.
in a sense
that
stick
or that
hit
of
Master
Oboku,
the stick
of Toksan,
is not
any different
than the
touch
of the
autumn wind
when you
really
feel it.
The sound
of
Rinzai's
shout is
really not
different
than the
sounds of
the valley
stream
when you
really hear
it.
Like I
said,
what it's
all about
is intimacy,
whole body
and mind
intimacy,
really being
intimate with
yourself.
And when
you're really
intimate with
yourself,
you're intimate
with the
ten thousand
things,
with the
whole
phenomenal
universe,
there's no
longer
any
separation.
If you
still don't
get it,
then look,
look at
September,
look at
October,
hundreds of
thousands of
gold and
yellow leaves
fill the
mountain
streams.
see it
for
yourself.
Don't
take my
word for
it.
