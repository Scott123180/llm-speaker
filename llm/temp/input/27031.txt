Thank you.
Amen.
Case 26.
Two monks roll up the blinds.
The main case.
The monks gathered in the hall to hear the great Hogan of Siryu give Tesho before the midday meal.
Hogan pointed to the bamboo blinds.
At this, two monks went to the blinds and rolled them up alike.
Hogan said, one has it, the other has not.
That's the Mumon's commentary.
Tell me, which one has it and which one has not?
If you have your Zen eye open at this point, you will then know how Master Siryu failed.
Be that as it may, you are strictly warned against arguing about has and has not.
Master Mumon's poem.
When they are rolled up, bright and clear is the great emptiness.
The great emptiness does not yet come up to our teaching.
Why don't you cast away emptiness in everything?
Then it's so lucid and perfect that even the wind does not pass through.
So, this is the last day of our Zen training weekend.
And there are many.
We do a Zen training weekend at least once a month.
And we do them not only here, but around the country and other countries as well.
And it's kind of interesting.
There are many reasons people come to Zen training workshops.
There are many things to explore.
Many reasons to explore.
Some come to a workshop of this kind in consideration of their own mental health.
A way of dealing with stress.
For some, their interest is in physical well-being.
Some even don't know why they come.
They just find the whole idea of the Buddha way an interesting and exciting thing.
And so they check it out.
Many people are interested in the arts.
They know the relationship between Zen and the arts.
And come as a way of exploring that a little further.
Others want to be a better person.
Some it's just a stop on the way of a journey that has absolutely nothing to do with Buddhism.
There are others who have manifested what we call the Bodhicitta, raised the Bodhi Mind, the Mind of Enlightenment, what we call the Spiritual Fire.
And one of the things about, one of the characterizations of that Spiritual Fire is that explanations and philosophies don't satisfy the Spiritual Fire.
It's something that can only be quenched with experience, the direct experience, otherwise it just keeps on burning.
Question after question keeps on arising.
And the peace of mind that the person is seeking, or the understanding that they're seeking, becomes more and more elusive rather than getting clearer.
One of the things that practice is about is realizing one's own enlightenment.
And having raised the Bodhicitta, having raised the Bodhicitta, having raised the Bodhicitta, having raised the Bodhicitta, or having that Spiritual Fire burning,
it's quite different than responding to questions concerning well-being, or becoming a better person, or taking care of stress, or not knowing.
And when you're working with a person where the Spiritual Fire burning, there's a kind of an ability to be able to hear that doesn't exist until that Bodhicitta mind is raised.
Able to hear a turning word, or the teachings, there's a kind of resonance, you know, it works just the way resonance in physics works.
There's a molecule vibrating at a particular frequency, and there are many other molecules that are also vibrating.
And it can go from molecule to molecule, nothing happens, and then finally it finds a molecule that's vibrating at the same frequency, and a coupling happens.
That coupling is resonance, energy passes back and forth from A to B,
and can even raise the energy level of the other molecule, or the other vibrating particle.
And that coupling of the vibrational frequencies has its equivalent in spiritual practice.
It's what was manifesting in the life of all the great sages,
in the life of Moses, of Merton, Ica, Jesus.
And it had to do with an experience, a direct experience,
not the descriptions, not the words and ideas that describe reality,
but rather the reality itself.
This master, Hogan of Siryu,
was typical of the monks during that period of time,
around 900, late 800s.
He was a scholar monk
with extraordinary understanding of Kegan philosophy.
Kegan is Huiyan.
Came from the Avakatamsa Sutra,
one of the highest developments of Chinese philosophy and thought.
And one of the things that is taught in Kegan philosophy is that
the three worlds exist because of the mind.
And every phenomena exists because of recognition.
And so it's talking basically about how
in order for a thing to exist,
it requires the organs of perception,
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,
and the object of perception,
form for eye, sound for ear,
odor for nose, and so on,
and consciousness to come together.
So the organ of perception,
the object of perception,
and consciousness together
create what we call reality,
existence.
And of course,
mind in Buddhism is one of the organs of perception
in Buddhist psychology.
It's treated differently than it's treated in the West.
And the object
of perception of that organ,
mind,
is thought.
And mind,
thought,
and consciousness
together create
a reality that's just as real
as the reality
of that sound
or the stick
from the perspective
of Buddhist psychology.
also part of it
is the principle
that
phenomena
and principle
or absolute
and relative
are interfused,
interpenetrated,
and limitless.
Now this was all
part of a philosophy,
a school of philosophy
that Hogan
was very well versed in.
And while he was still young,
his name was Bunke,
he was on a training journey
and during their pilgrimage
they stopped at a temple
called Jizo Inn
because of heavy rains
and floods
they were unable to travel.
So when the flood was over
and they were getting ready
to leave,
they said goodbye
to the abbot of Jizo Inn
who was mastication.
And Kation
pointed to a big stone
outside the front gate
and said to Bunke,
venerable monk,
all the three worlds
exist because of mind
and every phenomena
exists
because of recognition.
Tell me,
is this stone
inside your mind
or outside your mind?
It's in the mind,
Bunke replied immediately.
Mastication then said,
why
do you carry around
such a heavy stone
in your mind?
Bunke couldn't say a word.
in reply.
So he gave up
his pilgrimage
and stayed at the temple
to study with Mastication.
And from that time on,
day after day,
he would bring
his conclusions
on that koan
to the master
in the room.
And each time
Mastication would laugh
and say,
that's not live Buddhism
at all
each time
he was bringing
some of his
Kagan philosophy.
Bunke studied
even harder,
almost forgetting
to eat and sleep,
penetrating this koan.
The more devotedly
he searched,
the more desperate
he became.
and then one day
his energy
exhausted,
he confessed
to his teacher,
I have no word
to say
and no thought
to present.
He was driven
to the last extremity.
Mastication
told him,
if Buddhism
is to be shown,
it is perfect
and manifest.
with those words,
immediately
Munchai realized it,
realized the truth
that was evading him
all that time.
And he finally
succeeded,
Kesha,
became a teacher
in his own right.
What is it
that he realized?
All of you
hear the same statement.
Why is it
that he suddenly
had an enlightenment
experience
from those
simple words?
If Buddhism
is to be shown,
it is perfect
and manifest.
In a sense,
you can say that
about any religion.
In a sense,
you can say that
about anything.
Why did this
cause
a deep enlightenment?
Now,
Hogan,
as I mentioned,
was very well versed
in Buddhist philosophy.
So,
when he began
teaching
after his own
enlightenment,
a lot of his
teaching was based
on that Kagan
philosophy,
the oneness
of Zen
and
study.
So,
it's not just
realization,
but it's
realization
and understanding.
And it's based
on the
interfusion
of these
two things,
study
and realization.
So,
the words
and ideas
that describe
reality
and the
experience
of that reality.
So,
Monk once
asked Hogan,
what's one drop
of water
from Sogen?
In reply,
Hogan said,
one drop
of water
from Sogen.
Sogen is
the place
where the
sixth patriarch
lived.
And Gen
means the
source
or the
foundation.
So,
the monk's
question,
what is one
drop of water
from Sogen?
It's the same
as asking,
what's the
essence of
sin?
Another monk
once asked him,
what's the
ultimate truth?
The master
said,
first I pray
you'll live it,
second I'll
pray you'll
live it.
And so,
considering
the fact
that he
was constantly
dealing in
his teachings
with these
dichotomies
of absolute
and relative
this and
that,
which is
basically
the struggle
that we
all have.
We learn
to live
our lives
based on
those
dualities.
One side
we have
the process,
the other
side we
have the
goal.
One side
all the
good things,
the other
side all
the bad
things.
One side
heaven,
the other
side hell.
One side
gain,
the other
side loss.
Inside,
outside,
has,
has not,
coming and
going,
can do,
can't do,
yes,
no,
darkness,
light,
sacred,
secular,
right,
wrong,
good,
evil,
male,
female,
enlightenment,
delusion.
All of
those
dualities
are
representing
either one
side or
the other
side.
What is
the truth
that resides
in neither?
what is
the truth
that
transcends
coming and
going?
Has and
has not.
So one
day the
monks
gathered in
the hall
to listen
to Master
Hogan's
talk.
Hogan,
without a
word,
raised his
hands and
pointed to
the bamboo
blinds in
the room.
Two monks
jumped up.
one ran
to one
blind,
the other
ran to
the other
blind.
At the
same time
both of
them rolled
up to
two monks,
identical.
Hogan
looked at
one and
said,
one has
it and
the other
has not.
Now that
has it
and has
not,
obviously
what he's
talking about,
that it
is the
truth,
the reality,
has not,
has not
realized it.
So Hogan
is essentially
saying one
monk has
grasped
the truth
and the
other has
missed it.
And yet
both of
them did
exactly the
same thing
at the
same time.
And if
there's no
distinction of
right and
wrong,
has and
has not,
why did
Hogan say?
One has
it right,
the other
has it
wrong.
And if
there is a
distinction of
right and
wrong in
the same
action,
what kind
of right
and wrong?
What did
Hogan see?
It appears
like a
dilemma.
And what
the truth
of this
calling is,
is to see
through that
dilemma,
because it's
no different
than all
of the
other
dualistic
dilemmas
that we
confront.
Our minds
are basically
dualistic.
They almost
immediately go
to working
that way.
How do
you go
beyond that
is what
the question
of this
koan is.
This
koan is
pretty much
identical to
the koan
that Joshua
visited the
hermit.
and he
said,
are you
in?
Are you
in?
Or anybody
home?
And the
hermit held
up a
fist.
Joshua said,
the water is
too shallow
here to
anchor a
vessel.
Disapproving.
Goes to the
next hermit's
hut.
Are you
home?
Are you
home?
Are you
there?
Are you
present?
The hermit
held up his
fist.
And Joshua
said,
the water
is deep
to anchor
a great
vessel.
You have
the power
to kill
or to
give life.
They both
raised their
fists the
same way.
Why did
he approve
one and
not the
other?
Some
people have
said that
the whole
point of
this koan
is to
arouse the
great doubt
in the
mind of
students.
and if
they try
to understand
the significance
of one
has it
and the
other has
not with
their intellect
and reasoning
that it's
like looking
for horns
on rabbits.
Hogan is
very much
trying to
cut off
that
dualism
of gain
and loss
and right
and wrong.
So this
obviously
needs to be
seen in a
way that
goes beyond
the question
of gain
or has
and loss
has not
needs to
go beyond
logic
and
intellectuality.
And why?
Why did
Hogan see
the difference
of right
and wrong
in the same
act of
rolling up
the blinds?
according to
his own
Kagan
teaching
in equality
there is
difference
in difference
there is
equality.
we call it
putting snow
in a silver
bowl
you put
snow in
a silver
bowl
they appear
to be
the same
color
yet snow
is snow
and the
silver bowl
is a silver
bowl
or the
snowy
heron
standing
among the
white
reed
flowers
all of
it's
white
there seems
to be
total
blending
no
discrimination
yet
the egrets
the egret
and the
flowers
are the
flowers
definitely
a difference
how do
you
transcend
the
opposition
of
right
and wrong
there's a
great
philosophical
explanation
of this
coin
it goes
as follows
the two
monks
went
together
and rolled
up the
blinds
alike
this
symbolizes
equality
and oneness
which is
the universal
truth
Hogan
said
one has
it
the other
has not
this shows
differentiation
and two
which is
phenomena
he is
telling us
to see
the wonder
of the
oneness
of universal
truth
and phenomena
and that
in universal
truth
phenomena
is included
and in
phenomena
universal
truth
is included
a wonderful
clear
concise
explanation
then it
would probably
get you
an A
in a
course
on
Buddhism
but you
wouldn't
get the
first base
in the
face-to-face
teaching
because what
we're talking
about here
is not
an intellectual
interpretation
but rather
the direct
immediate
truth
of what
this
koan
is
Zen
doesn't
explain
the truth
of the
oneness
of oneness
and phenomena
but is the
actual life
of living
that
what is
the truth
of the
oneness
of absolute
and relative
Master Hogan
didn't explain
it
he lived
it
Joshu
lived it
Buddha
lived it
and it's
in the
living
of it
that it
manifests
in our
life
the
philosophy
of it
only
manifests
in our
head
and it's
quite
different
than
making it
work
in our
daily
encounters
now
Mumman
in his
commentary
said
tell me
which
one
has it
and which
one
has not
how do
you
respond
to that
and he
says
if you
have your
Zen
eye
open
at
this
point
then
you
will
know
Master
Sirio
failed
how did
he
fail
what did
he
fail
what was
Hogan's
failure
and then
he warns
us about
arguing
about has
and has
not
well the
question has
to do
with has
and has
not
how do
you avoid
it
when we
talk about
it
what is
it
when we
say that
when the
universe is
destroyed
it
is not
destroyed
what is
that it
that survives
the great
culpifier
what is
the it
that has
has not
been realized
by one
monk
and realized
by the
other
according to
Hogan
well it
is not to
be found
in the
absolute
and it
is not
to be found
in the
relative
Shibiyama
says
there's a
similar
koan
that's
used
in
Japanese
monasteries
today
and what
it says
is
two are
going
one does
not get
wet
this autumn
rain
so two
people walking
in the rain
one gets
wet
and the other
one doesn't
some people
regard it
just as a
funny little
haiku
they should
both get
wet
obviously
some get
involved in
arguments
of getting
wet
not getting
wet
there's a
whole
different
way
that's
unimaginable
to see
the truth
that transcends
all of the
dualism
what is
that truth
Master
Tendo
made a
very famous
poem
on this
koan
one has
it
one has
not
he said
a pine

several
years ago
the
gypsy
moths
descended
on this
mountain
took
every
leaf
off
every
tree
it was
suddenly
in the
middle
of summer
this
mountain
was like
transformed
to winter
it wasn't
a leaf
on a
tree
some
of the
weaker
oak
trees
died
people
were very
upset
everybody
was running
around
wanting to
kill
gypsy
moths
left
and right
big
battles
grew
over
whether
spraying
should
happen
or
non
spraying
and we
even
got to
the
point
of
this
ridiculous
thing
where
one
person
on a
50 by
100
piece
of land
didn't
want
to be
sprayed
and the
person
next door
on a
50 by
100
piece
of land
did want
to get
sprayed
and these
planes
would come
and you
hung out
a yellow
balloon
if you
didn't want
to be
sprayed
and the
spray was
going all
over the
place
there was
no way
to avoid
and then
they'd
fight
people
would put
tar
around
the
base
of
the
tree
so the
gypsy
moths
the
caterpillars
couldn't
climb
the
tree
well what
would happen
is they
would climb
and then
they'd get
stuck in
the tar
and finally
there was a
bridge of
dead
caterpillars
and they
would climb
over the
top of
the bridge
and get
up the
tree
and destroy
it
people
totally
freaked
out
it was a
great
opportunity
for good
and evil
up and
down
heaven
and earth
and it
went on
right here
it became
a real
live
working
corn
somebody
came in
with
10,000
praying
mantis
eggs
and sold
it to
a person
in charge
of our
gardens
and told us
how to
hatch them
and we've
paid some
outrageous
sum for
it
and
nobody
ever
saw a
single
praying
mantis
hatched
he just
disappeared
some guy
from
Virginia
but when
those oak
trees died
an interesting
thing happened
the whole
mountain was
in bloom
with mountain
laurel
most of the
mountain
laurel was so
shaded
that it
rarely came
into bloom
and not
only did
it come
into bloom
but you
could see
it when
you saw
from a
distance
instead of
looking at
a green
mountain
you were
looking at
a pink
mountain
of flowers
so
were the
gypsy moths
good or
bad
I guess
it depends
on whether
you're an
oak tree
or a
mountain
laurel
what is
right
what is
wrong
so long
as you've
got a
reference
system
working
you've
got an
answer
to that
how is
it when
there's
no
reference
system
what
happens
when
the
self
is
forgotten
usually
that
right
and wrong
good
and bad
gain
and loss
has to
do with
how it
affects
us
personally
but
when
personal
becomes
the whole
universe
itself
how do
you evaluate
it
how do
you categorize
it
how do
you judge
it
kind of
interesting
that's
what
neither
good nor
bad
really
means
what
what all
Hogan
is doing
is taking
away
all of our
logic
for solving
this
koan
that's his
medicine
to suit
the disease
and what the
disease is
is the disease
of dualism
the disease
of the
skin bag
the disease
of
putting
ourselves
locking
ourselves
in this
bag of
skin
and locking
everything else
in the
universe
out
and with
his koan
he's pecking
on that
shell
and from
the inside
tapping
peck
peck
tap
tap
that's the way
the hen
and the chick
work
to break
out of that
shell
no inside
or outside
in his
poem
Muman said
when they're
rolled up
bright and
clear is the
great emptiness
the great
emptiness is
the absolute
basis of
reality
bright and
clear
boundless
but then in
the very next
line he says
the great
emptiness doesn't
yet come up
to our
teaching
in the next
line he says
why don't you
throw it away
emptiness in
everything
like that monk
that came to
Joshua and
said I have
nothing left
let go of
everything
Joshua said
get rid of
that
I have
nothing left
it's another
idea
it's another
thought
another
position
like I'm
enlightened
or I'm
deluded
why don't you
cast away
emptiness in
everything
then it's so
lucid and
perfect that
even the
wind doesn't
pass through
how can
it be that
even the
wind doesn't
pass through
it what is
it that
the wind
doesn't pass
through
when the
wind itself
fills the
whole universe
we can't
speak of
passing through
and not
passing through
it reaches
everywhere
when you
yourself fill
the whole
universe
how can
we speak
of this
and that
how can
we speak
of inside
and outside
how can
we speak
of heaven
and hell
heaven is
right here
right now
hell is
right here
right now
the whole
point of
really
accomplishing
ourselves
the whole
point of
these
corns
and the
practice
is to
reach
a place
of accomplishment
where that
peace
is our
own
no one
can give
it to you
and nobody
can take
it away
from you
where no
longer is
there a
barrier
or a
con
where one
is free
of life
and death
gain and
loss
and it's
not
something
that can
be given
or received
when
Master
Dogen
went to
China
and spent
a number
of years
there
on his
return
when he
when he
was there
he received
the transmission
Soto lineage
was confirmed
by Master
Tendo
and when
he returned
they asked
him
what have
you learned
in China
and Dogen
said
I don't
know
all I know
is that my
eyes are
horizontal
and my
nose is
vertical
and I
remember
having
completed the
transmission
ceremony
with my
teacher
and I
went to
a final
interview
before returning
here to
Mount Tremper
and I
had no
idea what
was going
to happen
in the
interview room
I just
went in
and he
looked at
me for a
long time
and said
now we've
completed
this
ceremony
transmission
he said
what will
you bring
back
to the
Sangha
at
Mount
Tremper
because
how will
you teach
and if
I had
said
what Dogen
said
my eyes
are
horizontal
my nose
is
vertical
he would
have
beat me
with a
stick
and drove
me out
of the
room
so I
didn't
even
try
that
I could
have said
I bring
back
nothing
and I
know
you would
have
did that
that stinks
stinks of
holiness
and it
stinks of
Zen
how would
you answer
that
in spite
of all
of that
emptiness
on one
side
form
on the
other
side
neither
emptiness
or form
darkness
in light
light
within
darkness
interpenetration

arising

Mount
Tremper
the sun
rises over
Coral
Mountain
to the
east of
us
and it
sets
over
Mount
Pleasant
to the
west of
us
but on
Mount
Pleasant
the sun
rises over
Tremper
Mountain
and sets
over
Cross
Mountain
now you
tell me
how is
it
that one
has it
and one
has not
the only
way to
see it
is to
make it
your own
put yourself
into it
be the
koan
with the
whole body
in mind
be the
breath
with the
whole body
and mind
to do
that simple
thing
to be
intimate
in that
way
is what
we call
enlightenment
and it's
no different
than really
being intimate
with yourself
and really
being intimate
with yourself
is being
intimate
with the
whole universe
simple
truth
yet so
evasive
that's of course
we bring our
intellects
constantly
to it
the best
way to
see it
is to
just
be it
just
shut up
and sit
again
again
Thank you.
