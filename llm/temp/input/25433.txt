Master Dogen's 300 Koan Shobo Genzo
Case 17, Zedeng's Great Enlightenment
The main case
The great master Zedeng of Zigan Monastery
was bright in nature.
Being at the assembly of Guishan,
he was well learned
and had extensive memory.
Guishan one day said to Ziyan,
everything you say
is what you've memorized from commentaries.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.
When you were an infant,
before you could even distinguish
east from west,
at this time,
how was it?
Zigan spoke and presented his understanding,
explaining the principle,
but he could not get approval.
He went through the texts he had collected and studied,
but he could not find an answer
that would satisfy the master.
Deeply grieved and in tears,
he burned all his books and commentaries.
And then he said to himself,
I will never understand Zen in this lifetime.
I will become a hermit monk
and enter the mountain in practice.
Thus,
he entered Mount Wundang
and built a hut
near the grave site
of the national teacher.
One day,
while he was sweeping the path,
a pebble struck a bamboo
and made a cracking sound.
At that moment,
he suddenly had
a great enlightenment experience.
He wrote a poem
expressing his understanding.
One crack
and all knowledge
has dissolved.
The struggle is over.
I follow the ancient way,
not lapsing into quietude.
Dignified in bearing
and conduct
beyond sound and form,
no trace remains.
Those who have mastered the way
call this
unsurpassable activity.
He presented this poem
to Guishan,
who said,
this fellow
has penetrated it completely.
The Commentary
The Buddhas and ancestors
have not transmitted
a single phrase.
Guishan's Dharma
was transmitted
face to face,
mind to mind.
It was not about
pebbles, bamboo,
seeing, hearing, or knowing.
Because the way
reaches everywhere,
no communication
whatsoever is possible.
If you can penetrate
through the forest
of brambles
and cut free
all clinging,
you enter the peaceful dwelling
right where you are.
Capping verse.
Hearing sounds
with the whole body
and mind,
seeing forms
with the whole body
and mind,
one understands
them intimately.
The session
is kind of surprising,
unpredictable,
like most sessions are.
normally during
Ongo
sessions,
we
kind of expect
things to be
very strong,
very solid.
And
there were
one or two
of the last
couple of Ongos,
one or two of the sessions
that weren't
strong and solid.
And we expect
usually the
summer sessions
because of a little
lighter schedule
or a little lighter.
And
this session
is more like
an Ongo session
than some of the sessions
we've already done.
Sitting has been
strong.
The practice
has been
very sincere.
people have been
really
pushing
their edges.
It's
kind of surprising
given that
you know,
it's
not
a very pushy session
and
not a lot of
demands are being made.
That energy
has come right
out of this group,
whatever the karma
of this group
happens to be,
all of you
coming together.
one of the
things I had
heard in
Doksan
is that
the
talks
by the
three people
that preceded
me
were kind
of
pushy
talks
in a way,
kind of
demanding
that people
look at their
practice
and how
they're
practicing.
I was
telling
Shugan
this morning
that people
coming into
Doksan
all worked
up,
ready to
impale
themselves
on the
sword of
Manjushri
and said,
what the hell
have you been
saying out
there to
them?
And I
had this,
well in that
period of
time there
weren't many
choices
for
people
from
distinguished
families
what to
do
with their
lives.
They could
be a
general,
a
merchant,
or
follow
a
religious
life
and
many
of
them
chose
a
religious
life
rather than
the other
two.
And
as a
result,
some very
highly
intelligent,
highly
trained,
educated
people
ended up
in the
monasteries
of Tang
Dynasty
China
and
they were
very well
informed.
They knew
a lot.
it reminds
me a
lot of
the
situation
today.
Most
Zen
practitioners
are very
highly
educated.
It's not
because they
come from
wealthy
families,
it's because
education is
so much
more accessible
now than
it ever
was in
the history
of the
world.
So I
find that
contrary to
the way it
was when I
started
practice,
there were
no books
on Buddhism.
When I
first got
interested in
Buddhism,
I was
actually
teaching in
a Unitarian
Sunday
school.
And I
remember I
wanted to
teach
something about
Buddhism as
part of the
world religion
class.
And when I
went to the
library, I
could find
almost nothing
on Buddhism
in, I
don't know,
I guess it
was 1955,
56.
I found
stuff in
the
Encyclopedia
Britannica
finally and
used that
as the
basis of
a course
that I
was doing
for high
school
students.
So there
was very
little.
And when
we did
Cohen's
study,
what we
got was
the main
case on
a mimeograph
sheet of
paper without
the advantage
of all the
commentaries
and different
translations and
so on that
are available
now that,
well, I
don't know if
it makes it
easier, maybe
it makes it
worse for
the modern
student.
In any
case, there
was very
little available
in terms of
literature.
These days,
most practitioners
that come into
practice are
very well-read.
They know a
lot.
Many of
them, in
fact, have
taken courses
in Buddhism
at the
university that
didn't exist
in the
1950s.
And so
they're very,
very well
informed,
much like
what was
going on in
Tang Dynasty.
And Kyogen
was one of
these people.
He was
very scholarly
in nature.
And he
had a very
good memory.
And he
had been
practicing
with
Isan
for a
long time,
along with
his Dharma
brother,
Kyogen,
and his
Dharma
sister,
Ayn
Gleinstone
Lu.
And
Gwishan
said to
him one
day,
he said,
everything
you say
is what
you've
memorized
from
commentaries.
I'm
going to
ask you
a question.
And I'd
like you to
answer it
from your
own
experience,
not from
what you
read.
When you
were an
infant,
before you
could even
distinguish
east from
west at
this time,
how was
it?
What is
the truth?
What is
your
understanding?
Forget about
the
commentaries.
And Gwishan
couldn't
answer.
I mean,
he made
all kinds
of
presentations,
but none
of them
reached it.
Kind of
reminds me
a little
bit of
Ananda.
Ananda
was the
same way.
Ananda
had an
incredible
memory.
In fact,
it's said
that most
of the
sutras are
Ananda
reciting
from memory
after
Buddha's
death
all of
the
teachings
he gave.
And these
were written
down then
and became
the
thus I
have heard
that you
see in
the sutras.
That's what
Ananda
heard.
So he
could
verbatim
recite
everything
that the
Buddha
ever said.
And yet
the
interesting
thing is
is that
the first
successor
of the
Buddha
wasn't
Ananda.
It was
my
Kaisapa.
Ananda
came after
that.
Now
Ananda,
the reason
he memorized,
was able
to remember
all of
the talks
given by
the Buddha
is he
never missed
one of
them.
He was
always there.
he was
the
Buddha's
attendant.
So he
heard every
talk the
Buddha ever
gave.
And not
only did
he hear
it,
he remembered
it.
But on
Mount
Gudakutra,
when the
Buddha came
out to
address the
assembly of
thousands,
and without
a word he
held up a
flower,
it was
Makai
Kaisapa
that smiled
and blinked
his eyes,
not Ananda.
And the
Buddha said,
I have the
all-pervading
Dharma,
the exquisite
teaching of
formless
form.
It cannot
be conveyed
through words
and letters.
I now pass
it on to
Makai
Kaisapa.
And then
Makai Kaisapa
became the
second ancestor.
And then
years later,
the Buddha
died and
Ananda became
the attendant
to Makai
Kaisapa.
Years later,
he said to
Makai Kaisapa,
at that time,
on Mount
Gudakutra,
what else
did the
Buddha give
you other
than the
robe and
bowl
of the
transmission?
And
Makai Kaisapa
called out to
him and
said,
Ananda.
Ananda
said,
yes,
master.
And
Makai Kaisapa
said,
take down
the flagpole.
And the
flagpole,
the flag
always flew
when there
was a
lecture or
a
teisho
discourse
happening.
So take
down the
flagpole
meant the
discourse has
ended.
Ananda,
yes,
master,
the discourse
has ended.
and with
that,
Ananda had
a great
enlightenment
and the
Dharma was
transmitted to
the next
generation.
All
along,
in spite of
his great
understanding
and great
memory,
somehow he
hadn't
realized it
during the
time of the
Buddha.
it took
a great
leap of
consciousness
for him
to finally
get it.
So,
in a sense,
his great
understanding
and learning
was kind
of in
the way.
So,
Gyozan
spoke and
presented his
understanding,
explaining the
principle.
but he
could not
get approval.
Somehow,
Esau would
not approve
him.
He went
through the
texts and
commentaries
he had
collected
and studied,
but he
couldn't find
an answer
that would
satisfy the
master.
Then,
deeply
grieved
and in
tears,
he burned
all his
books and
commentaries.
And then
he said
to himself,
I will
never
understand
Zen
in this
lifetime.
Does that
sound familiar?
I hear it
all the time.
Usually,
there are
two extremes.
The one
extreme is,
I know
it all.
The other
extreme,
I don't
know anything
and I'll
never know
anything.
and somehow
our tendency
is always
to split
things up
that way,
one side
or the
other side.
The Buddha
way is the
middle way.
And you
would think
that the
middle way
would be
easy,
but it
seems to
be very,
very difficult
for most
of us.
We tend
to be
extremists,
one side
or the
other.
An awful
lot of
people
in
Western
cultures
seem to
have a
very poor
opinion
of themselves.
I remember
my teacher
trying to
understand
how that
happens.
You know,
he would
sit down
sometime
with the
seniors
and ask
if we
could,
you know,
help him
understand
why people
are always
putting
themselves
down,
calling
themselves
stupid,
that sort
of thing.
And usually
in Japan
when they
raise
children,
they kind
of spoil
them when
they're very
young.
The discipline
doesn't start
until later.
They're kind
of bratty,
in fact.
you know,
the Japanese
kids that
have been
around in
Japan kind
of have the
run of
things up
until a
certain age.
And then
after that,
they're like
really solidly
disciplined
with a very
demanding school
system.
And they're
expected to
conform to
all of the
requirements of
the culture
and the
school and
so on.
But in the
beginning,
it's like
total
freedom.
And maybe
that's the
difference,
that in
those early
ages,
a lot of
confidence in
themselves and
a lot of
trust in
terms of
their ability
or their
relationship with
parents and
so on,
before the
discipline sets
in.
I don't
know what
the reason
is.
and it's
hard for
me even,
I'm a
Westerner,
born and
raised here,
and it's
even difficult
for me to
understand it
because my
generation was
very different,
the way we
dealt with
raising
children and
what was
expected of
a child and
how a
parent related
to a child.
It was
actually a
European way
that I was
raised,
in a culture
that was
essentially
European.
It wasn't
even American
because everybody
around me,
the school,
the people in
the streets
and everything
was definite
European culture.
So it's hard
to appreciate
the fact that
people grow up
with a really
awful opinion
of themselves,
a kind of
lack of trust
and their
own ability
and to do
it.
And that's
kind of where
Gyozan was,
feeling very
inadequate.
Probably his
Dharma brother,
Gyozan,
was quite
remarkable,
in fact,
and was very,
very close to
the teacher,
Isan.
And together,
Isan and
Gyozan
formed the
Iggyo school
of Zen,
which continued
for many
generations.
So that may
have made him
feel a little
bit inadequate.
But somehow
he kind of
gave up.
But it's
interesting,
the way he
gave up,
his giving
up wasn't
Zen's fault.
He didn't
give up Zen.
What he gave
up was trying,
pushing so
hard.
He's decided
that he would
never understand
Zen in his
lifetime,
and he'll
become a
hermit monk
and enter the
mountain in
practice.
There was
never a thought
of abandoning
practice.
And I've
been reading
recently,
the last month
or so,
I've come
across several
books about
some of the
seed teachers
that were
responsible for
Zen coming
to the West
to begin
with.
My own
first teacher,
Son Roshi,
there are a
couple of
books that
are out
that haven't
quite hit the
bookstores yet.
maybe one
of them
has,
that deals
with his
life.
And I've
got a
manuscript in
my hands
that Shambhala
sent me to
make a
comment on
from Yastani
Roshi,
translation of
his teaching.
And I was
reading something
recently about
Harada Roshi
and Kori
Roshi.
These are
kind of the
seed teachers
that have
influenced the
movement of
Zen to the
West.
And the
one remarkable
thing about
all of them
is that they
had a very
sincere
attitude
about
practice.
So many
times I
hear from
students when
things get
tough or
they're in a
crisis,
they can't
sit.
The last
thing they
want to do
is sit.
That's the
first thing
I would
want to do
in a crisis
is to sit,
to return
to that
center.
that's
where
strength
is imparted.
That's
where
clarity of
mind
comes from
that allows
us to
deal with
the turmoil
that appears
in our
life.
And that's
what
Chogin
did here.
He left,
entered
the mountain,
Mount
Hudang,
built a
hut near
the graveside
of the
national
teacher.
The
national
teacher was
well-known
all throughout
China as
being a
very
outstanding
master.
He was
a successor
of the
sixth
ancestor.
There are
many
cons about
the
national
teacher.
And he
figured he
was good
for nothing,
so he
would become
a grave
keeper
and just
duzazen
and work
maintaining
the grave,
particularly
that of
the
national
teacher.
One day
while he
was sweeping
the path,
a pebble
struck the
bamboo and
made a
cracking sound.
And at
that moment
he suddenly
had a
great
enlightenment
experience.
And this
case is
quoted many
times in
the literature.
This and
the falling
peach blossoms
came to
a great
enlightenment.
It's
kind of
interesting
because those
breakthroughs
happen
very
unpredictably,
just like
a strong
session is
very
unpredictable.
Sometimes
I'm
astounded
with a
student
who will
be coming
to
Doksan
for years
and seem
to be
miles,
miles
from seeing
anything.
And one
day they
walk in
and they're
as clear
as a
bell.
And they
not only
pass the
khan,
but they
go through
all the
test
questions
on the
khan
like that.
And I
say to
myself,
I mean,
you know,
where did
this come
from?
Did he
find some
book or
something that
gave him
all these
answers?
I mean,
where did
it come
from?
And I
try to
trap
them,
and I
can't.
They're
really
clear.
And it's
astounding.
so when
you reach
that
point,
almost
anything
will trigger
it.
You know,
when the
fruit is
ready to
fall from
a tree,
a slight
breeze is
enough.
You know,
a bird
lights on
a branch
and the
branch
quivers a
little bit
in the
the
plums
fall off
the
tree.
Fruit
but it's
got something
to do
with the
breeze,
or it's
got something
to do
with peach
blossoms,
and it's
got something
to do
with bamboo
hitting,
stone
hitting
bamboo.
so you
can go
into a
bamboo
grove
and throw
stones at
bamboo
for the
rest of
your life.
You're not
going to
see it
unless you're
ready,
unless your
practice has
put you
at that
edge,
unless there's
that ripeness.
And you can
rush the
ripeness,
sometimes very
very kind
of pushy
sessions like
we used to
do in the
first couple
of years
here.
I would just
drive people
up the
wall by
pushing them
and pushing
them and
pushing them
and getting
them into
the corner.
And some
of them would
have
breakthroughs,
but then that
breakthrough wasn't
very clear,
wasn't very
deep.
Then I would
find myself,
when I'm
working with
the subsequent
koans with
them, that
because of
that lack
of original
clarity, the
subsequent
koans become
very, very
difficult, you
know, kind
of labor
through them.
And I
figure if I'm
going to be
with these
students for
the rest of
my life, I
want them to
be clear to
start with,
and the rest
of them will
be a lot
easier.
So I backed
off on that.
It's kind
of like when I
worked in
industry, one
of the things
that we
were doing
is working
with, you
know, these
trees, and
orange trees
in Florida.
They take
the oranges
before they're
ripe, and
then they
ripen them.
In fact, we
were even
working on a
thing that you
inject the trees
in, they'll
drop the
oranges so
somebody doesn't
even have to
pick them.
I don't know
how far that
got.
Anyway, they
get packed
into these
freight trains,
still green,
and then
they're filled
with the
gas, and
on the way
to market,
they turn
orange.
But they
don't taste
like oranges.
They don't
taste like the
oranges you
buy in
Florida when
they're coming
off the
trees.
So you
can force
certain things,
but it's not
quite the
same.
And when
Gyozan was
begging, he
was actually
begging Isan,
it's not in
the koan, but
it's in the
record of the
masters, begging
him to please
teach him.
And Gyozan
says, you
know, I can
tell you, but
that's not going
to help you.
I mean, all
you're going
to have is
my information,
and that's
not what the
koan is
about.
It's about
your
realization.
When he
finally realized
it, he
was so
grateful that
Isan didn't
tell him that
he made
prostrations in
his direction.
Somehow we
think that in
Doksan, what
needs to
happen is an
exchange of
information.
people come
into one of
the most
reoccurring
questions I
have from
students is,
I don't know
what to do
in Doksan.
Because they
come in and
they tell me
what their
practice is,
and I ask
them if they
have any
questions,
and I say
no, and
I say, okay,
stay with it,
and I ring
the bell.
And they
leave.
He didn't
tell me
anything.
I don't have
anything to
tell you.
All I can
do is
respond to
what you
present.
And I've
used the
example many
times before
of a ping-pong
game, you
know.
We're going
to play
ping-pong.
So you go on
your side of
the net, I go
on my side of
the net, you
have a paddle
in the ball, and
I have a paddle.
The ball is in
your court, starts
with you hitting
the ball.
There's nothing I
can do until the
ball comes to
me.
And so it
goes on in
face-to-face
teaching, it's
not a transfer
of information.
Something else
is going on
that's at a
very different
level.
So it's a
kind of
communication
unlike anything
any of us
have ever
experienced,
in our
regular
educational
process.
Because it
can't be
explained.
And so
Kyozan, after
his experience,
wrote a poem
expressing his
understanding.
He said,
one crack
and all
knowledge has
dissolved.
The struggle
is over.
I follow
the ancient
way, not
lapsing into
quietude.
Dignified in
bearing and
conduct beyond
sound and
form, no
trace remains.
Those who
have mastered
the way
call this
unsurpassable
activity.
Actually, this
poem is one
of the
koans, the
hundred
miscellaneous
koans that
we deal with.
he presented
to Kyozan, who
said, this
fellow has
penetrated
it completely.
Now, it's
kind of
interesting,
there's another
koan that I
think I've
already done
that has to
do with
Kyozan, the
other successor
of
Isan, who
didn't accept
the fact that
Kyozan was
enlightened.
I don't know,
maybe it was
sibling competition
or whatever, but
he said to
Isan, I don't
think he's
realized.
And he was a
senior disciple,
and teachers have a
tendency to listen
to their senior
disciples.
So he wanted
to further test
Kyozan's
understanding.
So Kyozan
composed a
second poem,
and in the
second poem he
said, my
poverty last
year was not
true poverty.
This year's
poverty is the
real thing.
Last year a
fine-pointed
gimlet could
find a place.
This year
even the
gimlet is
gone.
And nothing
remained.
Yangshan still
wasn't fully
satisfied, so
Kyozan wrote
a third poem.
And he
said, I
have a
single
potential.
It can be
seen in the
twinkling of
an eye.
If you
still don't
understand,
call the
attendant and
ask him.
And finally,
both
Yangshan
and Isan
approved him.
In the
commentary it
says, the
Buddhas and
ancestors have
not transmitted
a single
phrase.
Guishan's
Dharma was
transmitted face
to face,
mind to
mind.
It was not
about pebbles,
bamboo, seeing,
hearing, or
knowing.
So how
was it
transmitted
mind to
mind
when the
disciple was
a hundred
miles away
from where
the teacher
was when
the realization
occurred?
when that
question comes
up, it's
really a
question about
the confusion
of what the
mind to
mind
transmission
is about.
I hear it
from scholars
all the
time who
laugh and
say, you
know, there
was a big
gap from
this generation
to this
generation.
How can
you talk
about an
unbroken
lineage,
mind to
mind?
And my
answer to
them is
that if the
Buddha Dharma
disappeared from
the face of
the earth for
a hundred
years, and
there wasn't a
sutra to be
found or an
enlightened master
to be found
anywhere for
a hundred
years, if
one day
someone
realized
themselves,
immediately
there would
be a
direct mind
to mind
transmission
from the
Buddha to
that person.
It has
nothing to do
with space
and time.
Each
transmission,
each
realization
is mind
to mind,
not from the
teacher to
the disciple,
but from the
Buddha to
the disciple,
over a
span of
2,500
years.
It's
immediate
and it's
direct.
That's what
Buddha mind
means.
And so
Grishan's
Dharma was
transmitted
face to
face,
mind to
mind.
It had
nothing to
do with
pebbles,
bamboo,
seeing,
hearing,
or knowing.
Well, he
heard the
crack of
the bamboo.
Didn't
hearing have
something to
do with it?
Absolutely
not.
Not that
kind of
hearing.
That's
hearing with
the ears.
What we're
talking about
is hearing
with the
whole body
and mind.
It's a
very different
kind of
hearing.
And then
the next
line in
the commentary
says,
because the
way reaches
everywhere,
no communication
whatsoever is
possible.
What does
that mean?
We just
got through
talking about
transmission.
Isn't
transmission
communication?
No.
Nothing
goes from
A to
B.
Nothing
is given
and nothing
is received.
Why?
Because it's
already there.
Each one
of us is
born with
it and
dies with
it,
whether we
realize it
or not.
so no
communication
whatsoever
is
possible.
That
statement
is made
because you
can only
communicate
between
things that
are separate.
If it's
all one
thing,
no
communication
whatsoever
is possible.
All you
can do
is nod
to
yourself.
If you
can
penetrate
through the
forest of
brambles and
cut free,
all clinging,
you enter the
peaceful dwelling
right where you
are.
The forest of
brambles
are the
barriers,
the difficulties
that we
encounter in
life.
The clinging
are the things
that we
hold on
to.
And what
these
instructions
are saying
is just
drop away
those things
and what
remains
is the
peaceful
dwelling,
is the
Buddha
nature.
The
Buddha
nature
is just
buried
under all
of that.
So what
our practice
is about
is getting
rid of all
the extra
and getting
down to that
ground of
being that's
underneath it
all,
underneath
all of
the
conditioning.
I've added
footnotes to
this to help
clarify it.
The great
master,
Kyogen,
was bright
by nature.
Being at
the assembly
of Yisan,
he was well
learned and
had extensive
memory.
Footnote
says,
brambles,
a thousand
feet high
and a hundred
miles deep.
Those were the
brambles of
Kyogen.
Yisan one
day said to
him,
everything you
say is what
you've
memorized from
commentaries.
Now I'm
going to ask
you a
question.
When you
were an
infant,
before you
could even
distinguish
east from
west at
this time,
how was
it?
The footnote
says the
old man
wants to
kill this
monk,
but then
that's the
imperative of
our school.
Of course,
the killing
he's talking
about here
is the
killing,
the death
of the
ego,
the death
of a
notion of
a self
that separates
him from
the truth.
Kyogen spoke
and presented
his understanding,
explaining the
principle,
but he could
not get
approval.
The footnotes
says explanations
never do.
He went
through the
texts he
had collected
and studied,
but he
could not
find an
answer that
would satisfy
the master.
Footnote to
that said,
even if he
had found
it, still
it would
not reach
it.
Those would
still be the
words and
ideas that
describe the
reality and
not the
reality itself.
That's what
Isan was
looking for.
Deeply
grieved and
in tears,
and the
footnote says,
it's Guishan
who should
be weeping.
Sometimes
I feel
like weeping
when I sit
there with
a student
for 20
minutes and
give everything
I possibly
can, and
they don't
get it.
It's not
the student
that's failed,
it's the
teacher that's
failed.
It's my
fault, not
their fault.
In this
case, it's
Isan's
fault, and
he should
be weeping
instead of
his disciple.
Then he
burned all
his books
and commentaries,
and the
footnote says,
it's like
beating up
your car
because it
won't
start.
And there's
nothing to
do with
the books
and the
commentaries,
there's
nothing wrong
with the
words,
there's
nothing wrong
with the
sutras,
it's just
that those
are the
words that
describe the
reality.
What's the
reality?
What's the
experience of
the reality?
That's the
requirement of
the Zen
school.
And then he
said to
himself,
I will never
understand Zen
in this
lifetime.
I will
become a
hermit monk
and enter a
mountain and
practice.
Footnote
says,
good move,
time to
shut up
and sit.
Thus he
entered the
mountain and
built a
hut near the
gravesite of
the national
teacher.
Footnote to
that says,
the spirit of
the national
teacher remains.
One day
while he was
sweeping the
path, a
pebble struck
bamboo and
made a
cracking sound.
The footnote
says it's not
the pebble nor
the bamboo that
makes the
sound.
What is it?
You tell me.
See that
and you've
seen what
it was that
he realized.
At that
moment he
suddenly had a
great enlightenment
experience.
The footnote
to that says,
tell me,
what did he
see?
He wrote a
poem expressing
his understanding.
One crack
and all
knowledge is
dissolved.
The struggle
is over.
I follow
the ancient
way not
lapsing into
quietude.
Dignified
and bearing
in conduct
beyond sound
and form
no trace
remains.
Those who
have mastered
the way
call this
unsurpassable
activity.
The footnote
says,
still he's
as talkative
as ever,
yet there
seems to be
something to
it.
He presented
the poem
to Guishan
who said,
this fellow
has penetrated
it completely.
The footnote
to that
says,
only a doting
parent could
muck it up
like this.
And finally,
the capping
verse.
Hearing sounds
with the whole
body and mind,
seeing forms
with the whole
body and mind,
one understands
them intimately.
intimacy,
and I was
reading something
recently by
another teacher
who was talking
about intimacy.
And he was
saying that
intimacy is
about being
close,
being very
close.
Well,
intimacy is not
about being
close,
not the
intimacy that
Dogen is
talking about.
It's not
about being
close,
it's not
about being
very close,
it's not
about being
very,
very close,
it's about
no gaps,
no gaps
whatsoever.
It's about
seamlessness.
So hearing
sounds with
the whole
body and
mind,
seeing forms
with the whole
body and
mind,
one understands
them intimately.
no separation.
That's the
way to
practice
every aspect
of our
practice.
That's the
way to
practice
the breath.
That's the
way to
practice
move.
That's the
way to
practice
the cons.
That's the
way to
practice
our
barriers,
our
difficulties,
our
pain,
whole
body and
mind.
No
separation.
Dogen
commenting
on this
koan said,
bamboos make
sound when
hit by
stones,
but all
who hear
them do
not grasp
enlightenment.
I'm quoting
Dogen now.
By virtue
of long
and painful
training in
the way we
may grasp
the
Buddhist
truth.
Not
because the
sound of
bamboo hit
by a
stone is
sharp,
nor because
the color of
bamboos is
extremely fine.
The delicate
sound of a
bamboo is not
so much made
by the bamboo
itself as by
the stone that
happens to
hit it.
we are all
endowed with
the way,
but we
depend on the
collective
strength of
all practitioners
who are
practicing the
way for its
grasp.
Clever as we
are, we are
dependent on
them for our
training in the
way.
We must
therefore study
and seek the
way wholeheartedly
and earnestly.
Just as a
jewel becomes
valuable by
polishing, so
do we become
excellent by
training.
Is there any
jewel which
emits a bright
light from the
start?
Is there any
person endowed
with excellent
ability from
the first?
We should
train ourselves
just as we
polish a jewel.
We must not
belittle
ourselves, nor
be idle in
training.
This is an
admission by
the great
master Dogen.
We need to
trust ourselves.
not puff
ourselves up, but
not put
ourselves down
either.
Just simply
trust.
Appreciate the
fact that
just as we
are, we are
Buddhas, perfect
and complete.
There isn't a
single one of
us that
fails, that
comes short of
our own
completeness.
And to
appreciate that
fact is to
appreciate the
heart of what
this Buddhadharma
is.
It's not an
outside matter.
There is no
outside.
that's the
great matter of
life and
death of the
Buddhadharma.
See that
clearly and
you enter the
way that all
the Buddhas,
past, present,
and future have
entered.
See that
clearly and
you verify and
actualize the
realization of
the Buddha
himself in
your life.
So please
take care of
it.
