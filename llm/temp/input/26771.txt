Stage 2, Discovering the Footprints
Along the riverbank, under the trees, I discover footprints.
Even under the fragrant grass, I see his prints.
Deep and remote mountains, they are found.
These traces no more can be hidden than one's nose, looking heavenward.
Yesterday, Myotai gave a talk on the first stage of training.
And as we agreed, I'm doing the second stage.
These stages of training, it's important to understand, are kind of artificial in a sense.
One teacher talking about them said,
Something that is in reality, nothing, is organized into ten stages and commented on with many words.
It's really just simply a way of giving some definition to something which is ultimately without definition, without any form.
And as Dada Shi has mentioned many times, normally, traditionally, a student would just come into training and begin and then just continue and go on and on and on, having no sense whatsoever of where they were until they were finished.
And hundreds of years ago, these stages of training or the ox herding pictures, as they're depicted, came into existence.
And there are different versions, one that has ten, the one that we use and has been the most lasting, another that used six, and I think a couple of others.
But really, it's a way of just helping students have a sense of progression, which, even though it can be a very deep pit that we fall into looking for progress, it can also be helpful.
It can be a way of giving us a way of giving us a sense of accomplishment, of change, of development.
And what the stages tend to do is, in a sense, describe something that we ultimately experience for ourselves.
So, in the beginning, when you go down there and look at those pictures and read the poems, it's poetry.
But it begins to take on a whole nother meaning as we begin and then continue through our practice.
Now, what Myotai spoke about yesterday was basically getting started, beginning, and what that involves.
And one of the things she emphasized was not complicating what we're doing, not making it more complicated.
I was about to say that it already is.
It's not complicated.
It's not.
It's basically very straightforward, very simple, very direct.
And all of the complications and obstacles and barriers that we encounter along the way are not inherently part of the process, not inherently part of the path.
It's something that we bring into it.
And that, of course, is why people experience the practice differently, because we each bring different things into it,
depending on karma, on our history, on age, on all kinds of things.
And whatever we bring into it is what we're going to encounter along the way.
And the heavier that burden is, the harder it is going to be to let it go, the longer it may take to let it go.
In a sense, it really doesn't matter, because once we begin, once we enter the path, the goal has been realized.
The goal is being manifested as we practice.
We will eventually come to see that, and that's important, but the fact remains the same.
And in that first stage, really what's happening is we're meeting ourselves for the first time, for most of us.
For the first time, we're deliberately and consciously entering into something where what we encounter is ourself,
what we encounter is who we are, and that that happens in a very naked kind of way.
The problem in the beginning is that the mind doesn't allow us to see it yet, because it's so active, it's so busy.
It's all there, everything that we need to see is there, and that we will later see and later use for practice is there,
but we can't access it yet, because the mind just won't allow us.
It's like the door isn't open yet, and so we begin zazen.
And really that's what's happening with zazen, is just clearing away some of the debris,
so that we can just even get in, get the foot in, and begin to see what needs to be done.
And one of the inevitabilities, I guess, about practice is that we begin not only with our own karmic load,
our own baggage, whatever that may be,
but we also begin with a whole inventory of ideas about what it is we're getting ready to begin.
And that is natural, in a sense.
I mean, I don't think any of us come in here totally ignorant about the process.
Almost everyone has read something, heard something.
And all of that begins to fertilize a seed, which bears fruit when we enter into training,
because at that point, what we're basically doing is practicing those ideas.
We're practicing our imagination about what sin is.
As I was thinking about this, I was thinking about how powerful that is,
and how powerful being, we talk about being romantic, having romantic ideas about the practice,
and how difficult that can be, and how powerful.
And as I was sitting there, I thought, well, what does romantic really mean?
And I looked it up, and of course, it just means imaginary.
It means something based on either imagination or an emotional kind of appeal.
And that's very much, for many of us, what this is in the beginning.
And consequently, that's what we practice, because that's our understanding.
And so it becomes imperative that we engage zazen,
because that's the only thing that's going to cut through all of that
and actually show us what's really happening, rather than what we think is.
It made me think of a moment a long time ago.
I had done a master class with a very, very well-known concert pianist,
and was hearing a performance of his that evening,
and it was extraordinary, and the guy was unbelievable.
And I was talking to someone afterwards, and they said,
God, you know, he's so wonderful.
I'd love to be able to do that.
And instantly, in my mind, what I saw was this man as a young boy
coming home from school and going into practice,
and this man as a high school teenager,
while everybody else was playing football and riding bikes,
in the practice room practicing,
and this young man, at various stages of his life,
working and practicing and training and working and practicing and training.
And that's one of the problems that the idea,
the hook of the idea has, is we see a teacher.
We see something that we understand as a way,
a way into or a way out of,
and we basically want that.
We want to experience that for ourselves.
We want that to be our life.
And what we don't see is all of those hours in the practice room.
What we don't see is all of the work and the effort
and the struggle that went into it.
But we encounter that soon enough.
In the beginning, even though we tend to come in with so many ideas
about what training is,
for most of us, it's still relatively easy to be a student,
to hear, to see, to taste.
Everything is so new.
And we can allow ourselves that we don't know.
It's not so tough in the beginning because we don't know.
And because we came here to learn, and that's all very fresh,
and so it's okay to not know in the beginning.
And so being a student is okay,
and what we do is basically work very hard to try and learn,
just to get familiar with the practice, with the training,
with the way things function, with the sitting,
and to get comfortable in it.
And the teacher is there all along the way kind of supporting
and encouraging and so on.
And as time goes on, we begin to get confident.
And all this time, of course, the zazen is continuing and developing
and deepening and changing.
And at a certain point, we shift.
The practice begins to change, and different things begin to come into play.
And this whole first stage that Muotai spoke of yesterday
is really largely based on faith, because we don't know,
because we're beginning, because we're students,
because we have no actual experience of our own
to give substance to the words, to the teachings, to the examples.
And so we're predicating everything on the belief
that if we do such and such, this will happen.
Now, the second stage.
First of all, there's so much information and things that are said
that oftentimes we don't, these stages are kind of lost.
In terms of the sitting practice,
the first stage corresponds to working with the breath.
That's where we all begin.
So everybody comes in and begins counting the breath
and working with the breath.
And that changes as we progress through the first stage,
following the breath, being the breath, and so on.
Second stage is, for people doing koan study,
working on the first koan, which is sometimes Muot,
sometimes the sound of one hand,
depending on the teacher and the student.
For people who aren't doing koan study,
they would, at that time, begin doing Shikantaza.
So, at this point, our Zazen has developed enough
so that we can begin to sit, begin to practice,
begin to really experience stillness.
The posture tends to change as we go along.
My feeling is that the posture is just as much
a part of the practice as all the rest
because it constantly changes
and it seems that we're constantly getting in touch
with more and more subtle nuances
about what stillness means, what it is.
In the beginning, it just tends to be kind of
keeping it all together, not flailing out,
not fidgeting and so on,
but as that begins to settle down,
tension is movement.
Tension is a way of basically just maintaining
awareness about the body, which is not stillness.
So, even something as subtle as holding
or, you know, tightness
or any kind of constriction
becomes, can become, another way of just moving
and maintaining movement throughout sitting.
So, what stillness really means,
really needs to become,
is something that begins to develop.
Myotai spoke a lot about the breath yesterday
and that's extremely important.
At this point, we should be really becoming
intimate with the breath
and not only with how to sit with it,
but also how it so clearly mirrors us,
it mirrors our mind,
how it just is a direct reflection
of where the mind is,
whether it's still or agitated and so on.
Working with the witness
is something that we,
in the beginning,
can hardly even begin to see
because there's just so much activity going on,
but as time goes on,
really beginning to see
the levels of watching.
You know, how we can,
we can just simply be watching our sitting
or we can be watching ourselves watching
or we can be watching ourselves not watching.
I mean, it's just, it's infinite.
And that witness is
one of the last things
that tends to fall away.
Its grip is very, very tight.
And that's why the repetition of zazen
is so extremely important.
It's hard to appreciate,
you know, when we,
when the thoughts just come up
and you, you know,
think about how many times
you've had to let go of a thought,
you know, or thoughts,
you know, hundreds, thousands,
millions of times.
Each time that happened,
basically what we're doing
is we're letting go of the witness.
I mean, all kinds of things are happening
which are changing our lives,
changing who we are,
changing the way we understand
who we are
and how we use our mind.
This time is extremely important.
Extremely important
because what we're doing
is settling the foundation
for what will be,
we assume, a life practice.
You know, it happens all the time.
We want it all in the beginning.
We want it at once.
And when I was teaching music,
you know, kids,
adults would come in,
pick up the instrument
and say,
okay, I'd like to play such and such.
I'd like to do this.
And it's like, you can't.
You just can't.
That's not the way things work.
You have to start at the beginning.
And that repetition
and the training
and the discipline
and all of those words
that we tend to avoid
are what makes it possible.
That's the only way it works.
And every time,
just letting go,
letting go,
letting go,
what happens is
we simply have the ability
to do zazen.
And the mind begins to change.
It begins to change
the way it just simply
moves or doesn't move.
So the witness begins
to lighten its load
and begin to disappear.
And just the fear
that often is incumbent
with sitting,
the fear of stillness,
the fear of not watching,
the fear of being watched
for some people.
So it's, you know,
if you do it enough,
enough times,
long enough,
it just,
it's just not,
doesn't carry that weight anymore.
It just wears itself out.
We wear it out
through practice.
As the sitting gets deeper,
we will hopefully,
eventually get beyond
a lot of the issues
that tend to come up
in practice
which are really
just keeping us
from realizing ourselves,
from forgetting about the self.
A lot of psychological,
historical, emotional,
whatever,
kinds of issues
that tend to play very big
in our practice
in the beginning.
Ultimately,
we need to let them go.
We need to get through that.
It's just more stuff
that we have to get over
and beyond
and through
before we can actually,
in a sense,
really get to work,
really begin to sit
and be still
and let the body
and mind fall away.
So all the time
that the Zazen
is becoming more solid,
we're still struggling.
We're still struggling
to try and figure out
what it is we're doing.
Even though it is
deepening
and it is
getting more solid,
we don't always know
that that's what,
that what's happening
is what needs to be happening
or what should be happening.
And so there tends
to be a lot of struggle
just understanding
what we mean
by being the breath,
being the pain,
being our practice.
Just simply being.
What does that mean?
And how is Zazen
showing us that?
There's some accompanying poems
to this ox-herding picture.
One of them reads,
There are many wrong turnings
by the withered tree
in front of the cliff.
Caught like a bird in a nest
which is covered with grass,
it turns round and round
in a small cave.
Is he aware of his error
just at the moment
when his feet,
in searching,
follow the traces,
the footprints.
He misses the ox
and lets him escape.
Caught like a bird in a nest
turning round and round.
What's happening
as we move along
is that this practice
which in the beginning
was based almost entirely
on faith
is now being replaced
with a practice
that's beginning
to be based on experience.
You know,
in the beginning
somebody says,
do this,
sit this way,
use your mind here
and this is what's going
to happen.
Well, that's not what happens
in the beginning.
We don't just sit down
and concentrate.
We don't just sit down
and experience
the falling away
of body and mind.
We don't go out
to caretaking
and have it be
a deep,
you know,
profound,
still experience
of working samadhi.
It just doesn't happen.
And so,
but we continue.
We continue
based on the faith
that what we're being told
is true.
Now what happens,
of course,
is that
if we practice,
if we really put ourselves
into it,
it does begin
to happen.
We do begin
to see
the teachings
appear
in what we do
in very direct
ways,
in very clear ways.
The instructions,
the teachings,
the things that are said
that we hear over
and over
and over again
eventually are not
something that
is being told to us,
but something that
we suddenly see
and we experience.
But we get caught
in that happening
and kind of
oscillating between
that and
turning back
to our intellectual
understanding
of what it is,
of what Zen is,
of what practice is,
of what it should be.
And we kind of
bounce back and forth.
We turn in circles.
As he says,
caught like a bird
in a nest.
Is he aware
of his error?
Is she aware
of her error?
Are we aware
that that's what's
happening?
Oftentimes not.
Oftentimes it's
just
happening.
We call it
dancing on the edge.
Being on the edge
of forgetting.
Forgetting all
of that stuff.
Forgetting all
of the ideas.
Forgetting the
teaching.
Forgetting the
self.
Forgetting the
witness.
And actually
being something.
Being on that
edge and then
suddenly pulling
back.
Because oftentimes
in the beginning
it is frightening.
But what's
happening is
that we're
seeing the
footprints.
The ox
isn't there.
We haven't
seen the nature
of the self.
but the
prints are
there.
We no
longer have
to rely
totally on
what someone
says.
Because there's
enough of a
clue here that
we can begin to
proceed on our
own inspiration,
motivation.
Those teachings
are becoming
physical.
one of the
things that
has always
been so
vitally
important to
me about
this is
that we
do it,
is that I
do it,
that you
do it.
You know,
we often
use the
simile of
rubbing
two sticks
together to
form to
create a
fire.
And that if
you stop
rubbing, the
fire doesn't
burn, doesn't
ignite, so you
have to keep
rubbing.
But the
part of that,
one part of
that that I
relate to is
the fact that
you're creating
your own fire.
If you've ever
done that, if
you've ever built
a fire that way,
it's an
extraordinary
experience.
You know,
something as
simple and
as, you
know,
just silly
as fire to
actually take
just something
that you find
in the woods
and build it
and create it.
It's an
empowering
experience.
And that's
what we're
doing.
That's what
we're doing
in the city,
in the
practice.
So, in a
way, it can
be a very
exciting time
because there's
a lot
happening.
We're still
new enough
in the
practice that
we have to
be very
alert and
everything.
there's still
a kind
of freshness
and yet
we see
the prints
are there,
the traces
are there.
We're beginning
to see
that it's
real.
And because
the mind
is clearing
at this
point,
because the
thoughts are
beginning to
diminish,
we can,
for the first
time,
really begin
to see
ourselves,
really come
face to
face with
ourselves.
ourselves.
And so,
at the
same time
that this
is very
kind of
full of
growth and
energy,
it's also
a very
confrontive
time in
our practice.
It's a
time of
testing,
in a sense,
when many
very fundamental
things that
are required
for practice
are tested,
are put to
the test.
We have
to really,
we are
challenged to
see what's
driving us.
All of
those ideas
and dreams
and stories
and tales
that helped
us in
practice in
the beginning
that guided
us,
that informed
what it was
we were doing
don't work
anymore.
it's like
we're running
out of
tricks.
The things
that we did
in the
beginning
no longer
work.
And what
tends to
happen with
us when we
come into
training is
it's a bad
analogy but
it's kind
of like
being on
a leash.
And
early on
when students
enter into
training the
leash is
really long
and it's
kind of
like that
bag of
tricks that
we walk
in with
to a
certain extent
is okay,
is allowed,
will function.
What happens
though as
our commitment
and our
intention
deepens
is that
that leash
kind of gets
pulled in
and we
begin to
be held
accountable
for those
things that
have been
informing our
practice.
So that
in a sense
this practice
of ideas
that was
the beginning
now becomes
a practice
of practice
the practice
of the
self
the practice
of just
moment to
moment
doing what
we're now
able to do
in a different
way because
the mind
will allow
us that
because we
have learned
how to allow
the mind
to do that.
And it's a
very critical
time because
it can be a
time when we
stop because
in a sense
at this
time our
priorities are
what will
determine what
we do.
It's always
been
seemed kind
of immensely
ironic that
we come into
practice and
we clearly say
yes this is
what I want
to do.
I want to
engage this
training.
I want to
forget the
self.
I want to
forget the
idea that I
exist separate
and distinct
from the rest
of the
universe and
I want
help in
that.
And then
what we
immediately do
is we go
out and we
buy truckloads
of brick and
we start
building up
the wall to
fortress ourselves
against that
from happening.
So it's like
this kind of
push me,
pull me kind
of thing that
begins where
we're doing
what we've
said we want
to do and
we're fighting
it.
We're resisting
it.
We're
challenging
it.
But in
a way,
this moment
is exactly
what we've
been preparing
for all
along.
And the
trap is,
as Mirotai
pointed out
yesterday,
that we
tend to see
the first
stage as
kind of
what you
have to do
to get
on to the
real thing.
And that's
not true.
Sitting in
the first
stage of
training is
exactly the
same as
the second
stage and
the third
stage and
the fourth
stage.
It's exactly
the same.
It's Azen.
The potential
for forgetting
the self is
exactly the
same if
you're working
with a breath
or if you're
sitting with
Mu or doing
Shikantaza.
It's not
different.
And yet,
working in a
different way
does put us
in a position,
does put us
in a place
where the
potential tends
to become
more real.
And as our
practice develops,
we tend to
enter into a
state of mind
where we can
really begin to
do what it
is we've
come out
to do.
Incredible that
moment because
we're warned
about this from
day one.
We hear it
all the time,
practice is
difficult.
When people
come into
guardian council
to petition
to become
students,
we generally
usually tell
people pretty
straightforwardly
what to
expect.
Yes,
Dada,
she is nice
right now.
He's very
supportive.
But that's
not going to
last.
if you
want to
do what
you're coming
here to
do.
It's not
going to
last.
And we
always say,
are you ready
for this?
And we've
never yet
heard anyone
say,
I don't
think so.
No,
I don't
want to do
that.
Of course,
everyone says
they're ready.
I'm ready.
I want that.
And yet,
the gap
between that
and between
being in
the middle
of it,
it's no
longer
an idea.
It's real.
And the
gap between
that is
sometimes
unfathomable.
It's so
unfathomable
that when
it's happening,
we don't
realize it's
happening,
even
intellectually.
Even
intellectually,
sometimes we
can't
kind of
extricate
ourselves
and say,
oh yes,
this is
training,
and this
is what
they've been
telling me
was going
to happen.
We become
blind.
Because if
it's really
working,
what's
happening is
that something's
being taken
away.
And again,
we're building
our walls so
that that
doesn't happen.
We want to
give it up,
but we don't
want to give
it up.
We've asked
this person
to steal
ourself
from us,
and we
hate them
for stealing
that,
for taking
that precious
thing away.
So one of the
things that gets
tested very
deeply is
being a
student.
And I don't
mean being a
formal student,
I mean just
being a
student,
hearing,
trusting,
practicing,
just basic
stuff,
nothing high
and lofty.
And it
tends to get
harder to do
that because
the investment
is deeper.
We put in
more time,
we put in a
lot of energy,
and we're
looking for
something back.
We want
some yield.
And it
can become
more and
more difficult
to still
be a
student if
we don't
feel like
we're getting
back what
we deserve.
better.
Sometimes
being a
student just
begins with
seeing that
we're actually
stuck.
Sometimes we
can't even
see that.
All we
can see is
that the
world is
crashing
down,
that there
are too
many demands,
that something
has gone
wrong,
that someone
has gone
wrong,
and we
just can't
even see
that we're
just simply
stuck,
that the
practice is
working
beautifully,
that it's
doing exactly
what it's
supposed to
do,
that this
is the
moment we've
been waiting
for.
We can't
see it.
And
motivation
becomes very
important at
that time.
why.
If there's
an alternative,
we'll do
that.
If there's
something
better,
something
easier,
something
quicker,
and the
motivation
isn't
fundamental,
then some
time will
come and
we'll just
shift.
shift.
And in a
sense,
that's
okay.
Our
commitment
gets tested,
our
determination.
we've seen
students who
are very
committed,
who have
great
questioning,
great doubt.
They really
want to know,
but they just
can't do it.
They just
can't work.
They can't
put their
ass on the
safo and
sit.
Trust.
Maybe I
can't do
this after
all.
Suddenly
becomes a
thought.
Because
there's a
tension here.
There's a
tension
that begins
to build
and develop.
that's a
tension
between
our
grasp on
reality
and what
we're
beginning to
see.
The
footprints,
the
traces of
the ox.
So there's
what we've
led our
life to
believe all
along is
true,
and then
suddenly there's
something else
and it
doesn't make
sense.
It's not
we can't
intellectualize
it in a
way that
really works.
And somehow
there's a
problem.
And so
we have to
do something
with that
tension.
The thing
we need to
do is put
it into
practice.
It's to
put it
into the
heart.
But
sometimes
that
doubt,
that
confusion
gets
very,
very
strong.
Maybe
I can't
do it.
Maybe
this isn't
the
practice
for me.
You know
what I
mentioned
yesterday?
Maybe
the
practice
is what
isn't
quite
right.
And one
thing that
we oftentimes
start to
do is
look for
guarantees.
Because the
stakes are
getting higher
and we
want to
know.
Tell me
if I do
this,
will I
realize
myself?
There's
no guarantee.
If I
realize
myself,
will I
make the
right choices,
do the
right things?
There's
no guarantee.
If I
realize the
precepts,
will my
life
naturally,
immediately,
spontaneously,
come out of
those precepts?
There's no
guarantee.
And what
is that
that we
want?
It's kind
of crazy.
I mean,
if you
walked into
practice and
somebody said,
okay,
you're going
to do
this,
and at
a certain
point,
this is
going to
happen,
and you're
not really
going to
have any
choice.
And then
another
time,
this is
going to
happen,
and from
that time
on,
your life
is going
to be
this way,
and you
won't have
any
choice.
That's
not what
we
want.
And
that's not
freedom.
Being free
is being
free to
make a
choice,
to act,
to make a
mistake,
to take a
risk.
Of course,
practice,
seeing the
self,
realizing the
self,
changes
it.
But there's
no guarantee.
Thank God.
We had a
fellow call a
couple weeks
ago,
last week,
I think he
was a
college student
at Vassar,
doing a
senior thesis
on something
like,
I don't
know,
meditation
around the
world.
It was
some kind
of outrageous
thing,
and he
wanted to
do part
of it
on Zen,
and so
we did
a little
phone
interview.
And
at the
end of
it,
he said,
well,
tell me
this,
what has
your practice
done for
your life?
And I
said,
you know,
I really
hate this
kind of
question.
I hate
it because
there's
nothing I
can say.
There's
nothing I
can say
that will
answer that
question.
If we
started now
and went
for the
rest of
time,
I couldn't
say it.
What
hasn't
changed
because of
practice?
practice.
And he
said,
okay,
okay,
well then,
what's
the most
important
thing,
the most
powerful
thing?
This
happened
because of
your
practice.
And
before I
knew it,
I said
responsibility.
And I
really have
been thinking
about that
because my
answer really
took me
by surprise.
and yet
it's true.
And that's
what's
happening
here.
That's
what's
happening
in this
time of
practice
is we're
beginning
to take
responsibility.
We have
to begin
to take
responsibility
for what
we're doing.
that's
the only
way
it
happens.
And we
take
responsibility
for all
of it.
And that
means that
sometimes we
fail,
sometimes we
succeed.
And that's
the reason
the teacher
is so
important in
this because
the teacher
is willing
to take
that risk.
The teacher
is willing
to fail
or succeed,
to live
or die
so that we
can realize
ourselves.
They're
willing to
do that
long before
we are.
They're
willing to
do that
the day
we walk
in and
say,
I want
to do
it.
From
that point
the teacher
is ready
and willing
and waiting
for the
opportunity.
unfortunately
all of
this
is making
something that
is really
very
straightforward
complicated.
It's
making
something
which is
very
clean
dirty.
We don't
need to
know about
any of
this.
We don't
need to
understand
any of
it.
We don't
need to
have
heard
any of
it.
It can
help.
It can
hinder us.
The only
thing we
have to
do is
abandon
ourselves
to it.
Years
ago I
was
at a
junction
in my
life
where I
was
deciding
what to
do.
It was
a very
scary
time for
me.
The
choice
was
basically
whether
to
commit
myself
to
becoming
a
professional
musician.
There
were a
lot of
reasons
why I
shouldn't
have
done
that.
That's
what made
it frightening.
I was
talking to
a friend
of mine
who was
a musician
we were
living in
New York
City.
I was
talking to
him about
it and
he said
as soon
as you
make the
choice to
do it
at that
instant
things begin
to change
simply by
virtue of
having made
the choice.
I said
I don't
know.
He said
right.
You don't
know.
You can't
see that
until you've
made that
choice,
until you've
made that
decision.
Only then
will you
see things
in that
way.
And he
was absolutely
right.
Absolutely
right.
And that's
absolutely the
way this
works.
It does
not work
being half
in and
half
out.
Half
intent and
half
waiting,
watching.
We can
practice that
way.
We may
even see
progress,
but we
can't take
it to full
distance.
It takes
everything.
And all
we have to
do is make
that decision.
that we're
going to
do it.
And to
then begin
doing it.
If we
just do
that,
everything
else takes
care of
itself.
But it's
just doing
that that
does come
so
uneasily.
It's an
incredible
journey.
for which
we don't
have to
take
anything.
We have
everything
we need.
how long
does it
take?
Depends
on when
we start.
Depends
on how
we start.
Depends
on what
happens the
moment after
we start
and the
moment after
that.
it's not
safe.
Trungpa
Rinpoche
said,
it's better
not even
to begin
because the
danger of
beginning
is that
if you get
to the
point where
you see
those
footprints,
where you
see
that
there's
something
real,
there's
something to
be had,
and there's
something to
do,
then how
can you
turn back?
We
could.
People
do it.
You
can just
forget about
it.
Forget
about the
outrageous
claim.
that it's
possible to
put an
end to
suffering.
That it's
possible to
realize
freedom.
We can
forget about
that.
Or maybe
we can't.
Practice
and verification.
That's
what's
happening
in stage
two.
That's
what's
happening
in session.
It's
what's
happening
every
single
moment
that we're
practicing.
It's
exactly
that.
Practice
and
verification.
Practice
and
verification.
Seeing.
Not the
Buddha's
words.
Not the
words of
Rinzai,
Dogen,
Dado
Sensei.
Your
words.
Your
mind.
It's
real.
It's
real.
It's
extraordinary
to be in
this place,
in this
time.
To be
somewhere
where it's
just there.
All we
have to
do is
reach.
It's
not easy,
but it
is.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
It's
easy.
