Summit of the Mystic Peak, Bluecliffe Record, Cases 23, 25, and 26.
Case 23, Master Ingo's Pointer.
Jade is tested by fire, gold by a stone, sword by a hair, water by a staff.
In Zen training, the degree of one's attainment and one's progress is known by one's words and phrases,
one's attitude and actions, one's coming and going, one's asking and responding.
Tell me, how will it be done?
Listen to the following.
When Hofoku and Choke went out for a walk, Hofoku pointed with his finger and said,
this is the marvelous, sacred, mystic peak.
Choke said, what you say is well said, but what a pity.
Choke puts in his comments saying, today, walking with this man, what is he plotting?
And again he says, I don't say we do not find such people as this once in a hundred or a thousand years,
but they are rare.
A monk related this to Kyose, who said, but for Choke's remark, the field would have been littered with skulls.
Master Setyo's verse.
This is the summit of the mystic peak.
Now weeds grow rampant.
You see it clearly, but to whom could you impart it?
If you, O Choke, didn't discriminate, many would never know,
and their skulls would litter the field.
And this week and intensive
had to do with
part of our
ongoing theme,
and that is the looking at mysticism
and three great religious traditions
of
Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism.
And this weekend we
did the first
of that series,
a look at Christian mysticism
with
Professor Bochin
and
through
a lot of the teachings
of
Merton.
And again and again, the question comes up,
of course, what is
what is the mystical experience?
What is
what is indeed mysticism itself?
Now in this
sutra,
in this
koan,
there's a reference to
the marvelous
mystic peak.
Now that marvelous mystic peak
is
kind of,
it's a reference, first of all,
to a mythological sacred mountain
that's referred to in the Avakatamsa Sutra.
And through these centuries
it became
kind of symbolic
of ultimate reality
itself.
So it's another way of saying
ultimate reality.
In a sense,
what Hōfoku was doing
was pointing to
right where he was
and saying
this is
ultimate reality.
And Chokye,
who was with him,
who was
a much more senior,
much more mature
monk,
said,
though it's
true what you say,
what a pity.
So Chokye was
making a comment
on
that statement
of ultimate reality.
And
Satcho's commentary
and Kiyose's comment
were all
approving
what Chokye said.
And many times
you've heard
us talk
about the fact
that
one aspect
of Zen training
is ascending
the mountain.
And then
sooner or later
with great faith,
great doubt
and great perseverance
one reaches
the peak,
the great
mystic peak,
the ground of being,
ultimate reality,
the thing that
the mystics
talk about
constantly.
But that the journey
doesn't end
on the peak,
it continues.
And it continues
down the other side
back into the world.
Many times
I've referred to
the work of
Evelyn Underhill,
her book
Mysticism
is a classic
in the field.
She's written
many books,
actually.
And is quite
an extraordinary
woman.
I've tried
to get
more detailed
information
on her life
and whether
or not
there was
any
mystical
training
other than
what she learned
from reading
or at the
university.
But
her book
Practical Mysticism
I mean,
her book
Mysticism
was written,
I think it was
published in
1901
and 1902,
which was kind
of extraordinary
for that period
of time.
And to this day
it remains
a definitive
work on mysticism.
There have been
hundreds of books
since,
but none of them
come anywhere near
the understanding
of the whole
process
that is exhibited
in the works
of this woman.
And she lived
during the period,
she was born in
1875
and died in
1941,
so quite young.
She was 66 years old
when she died.
She's an English
poet
and a novelist
and also a writer
on mysticism.
And she was born
in England
and educated
at King's College
for Women
in London.
And she became
a lecturer
on philosophy
of religion
at Oxford
in 1921.
And it was
between 19
and 1920
that she wrote
lots of novels
and lots of poetry.
But then
the reason
she survives
to this day
is not because
of her novels
or her poetry,
but rather
because of her
great works
on mysticism.
And she wrote
The Mystic Way,
Practical Mysticism,
Essentials of Mysticism,
Life of the Spirit
and Life of Today,
Concerning the Inner Light,
Man and the Supernatural,
The House of the Soul.
There's a whole series
of books
that she wrote
during a very short
period of time,
10, 15 years.
And all of them
exhibit a profound
understanding,
not just the work
of a scholar,
but a profound
understanding
of her subject.
In this particular book,
Practical Mysticism,
you know,
the question comes up,
well, you know,
mysticism is okay
for monks
and monasteries,
but what about
nine to five?
What about
dirty diapers?
What about
the homeless
and the hungry?
The environment
taking care
of the roof
over our heads
and the food
on the plate?
And again
and again
the statement
comes up
that those
who regard
the mundane
as a hindrance
to practice
only understand
that in the mundane
nothing is sacred.
but what
they haven't
yet understood
is that
in sacredness,
true sacredness,
nothing,
nothing
is mundane.
In her preface
to her book
on Practical Mysticism,
she says,
and let me quote,
this little book
was written
during the last
months of peace
and goes to press
in the first weeks
of the Great War,
because this was
World War I.
Many will feel
that in such a time
of conflict
and horror
when only the most
ignorant,
disloyal,
or apathetic
can hope
for quietness
of mine,
a book
which deals
with that
which is called
contemplative
attitude
to existence
is wholly
out of place.
So obvious
indeed
is this point
of view
that at first
thought
I was going
to postpone
this publication.
On the one hand
it seems as though
the dreams
of a spiritual
renaissance
which promised
so fairly
but a little
time ago
had perished
in a sudden
explosion
of brute force.
on the other
hands
the thoughts
of the English
race
are now
turned
and rightly
toward the
most concrete
forms of action
struggle
and endurance
practical sacrifices
difficult
and long
continued effort
rather than
towards the
passive attitude
of self-surrender
which is all
that the practice
of mysticism
seems at first
to demand
moreover
that the deep
conviction
of the dependence
of all human
worth upon
eternal values
the eminence
of the divine
spirit
within the
human soul
which lies
at the root
of a mystical
concept of life
is hard
indeed
to reconcile
with much
of the human
history
now being
poured red
hot from
the cauldron
of war
for all
these reasons
we're likely
during the
present crisis
to witness
a revolt
from those
superficially
mystical
notions
which threatened
to become
too popular
during the
immediate past
yet the title
for this book
was deliberately
chosen
mysticism
means nothing
if the attitude
and the discipline
which it recommends
be adapted
to fair weather
alone
if the principles
for which it
stands break
down when
subjected to the
pressure of events
and cannot be
reconciled with the
sterner duties
of national life
to accept this
position is to
reduce mysticism
to the status
of a spiritual
plaything
on the contrary
if the experiences
on which it is
based have
indeed transcended
have indeed
the transcendent
value for humanity
which mystics
claim for them
if they reveal
to us a world
of higher truth
and greater reality
than the world
of concrete
happenings
in which we seem
to be immersed
then that value
is increased
rather than
lessened
when confronted
by overwhelming
disharmonies
and sufferings
of the present
time
she says
we learn
from the records
of the mystical
consciousness
that the mystical
consciousness
has the power
of lifting those
who possess it
to a plane
of reality
which no struggle
no cruelty
can disturb
of conferring
a certitude
in which no
catastrophe
can wreck
yet it does
not wrap
its initiative
in a selfish
and otherworldly
calm
isolate them
from the pain
and effort
of common life
rather it gives
them renewed
vitality
administering
to the human
spirit
not
as some
suppose
a soothing
draught
but the most
powerful
of stimulants
obviously
she understood
the practice
that we call
descending the
mountain
a practice
that we call
manifesting
the valley
spirit
then she
deals with
the question
which seems
to have come
up
again and
again
and always
comes up
what is
mysticism
exactly
what is it
that we're
speaking of
and she
says of
this
those who
are interested
in that
special
attitude
toward the
universe
which is
now loosely
called
mystical
find themselves
beset
by a multitude
of persons
who are
constantly
asking
some with
real fervor
some with
curiosity
and some
with disdain
what is
mysticism
when referred
to the
writings
of the
mystics
themselves
and to
other
works
in which
this
question
appears
to be
answered
these
people
replied
that such
books
are wholly
incomprehensible
to them
then she
says
on the
other hand
a genuine
inquirer
will find
before long
a long
number of
self-appointed
apostles
who are eager
to answer
this question
in many
strange
and inconsistent
ways
calculated to
increase
rather than to
resolve the
obscurity
of their mind
what we call
Buji Zen
you will learn
that mysticism
is a philosophy
an illusion
a kind of
religion
a disease
that it means
having visions
performing
conjuring tricks
leading an idol
dreamy and selfish
life
neglecting one's
business
wallowing in
vague spiritual
emotions
and being in
tune with the
infinite
you will discover
that it
emancipates him
from all dogmas
sometimes from
all morality
then at the
same time
that it's a
very
that it is
very superstitious
one expert
tells him that
it's simply
catholic piety
another that
Walt Whitman
was a typical
mystic
the third
assures him
that all
mysticism
comes from
the east
and it
supports a
statement
by an
appeal to
the mango
stick
at the end
of a
prolonged
course of
lectures
sermons
tea parties
and talks
with earnest
persons
the inquirer
is still
heard saying
too often
in tones
of exasperation
what is
mysticism
and then
she says
here's a
definition
a little
further down
mysticism
is the
art of
union
with
reality
the mystic
is a
person
who has
attained
that union
in a
greater
or less
degree
or who
aims at
and believes
in such
an attainment
and then
she says
when you
first look
at this
immediately
the thing
that comes
up is
well what
is reality
since it's
union with
reality
we have to
know what
reality is
in order
to unify
with it
and
she says
let's put
this aside
for a
moment
and deal
with
union
and then
the basic
thrust of
her book
is that
sense of
union
but of
course that
union
with reality
is none
other than
what we
talk about
in terms
of intimacy
being
intimate
being
intimate
with
form
hearing
form
with the
whole
body
and
mind
seeing
sound
hearing
sounds
seeing
forms
with the
whole
body
and
mind
hearing
sounds
with the
whole
body
and
mind
one
understands
them
intimately
and you
hear the
cry
be the
pain
with the
whole
body
and
mind
that
too
is
intimacy
we
hear
to
forget
the
self
to
study
the
Buddha
way
is
to
study
the
self
to
study
the
self
is
to
forget
the
self
that
too
is
intimacy
there
can
be
no
intimacy
so
long
as
there's
a
self
that
separates
us
from
anything
and
yet
in a
sense
to
forget
the
self
really
means
to
really
be
yourself
so
that
union
is
with
the
ten
thousand
things
with
the
whole
phenomenal
universe
to the
Christian
that
union
is
with
God
to the
Buddhist
with
the
whole
phenomenal
universe
but
what
does
it
mean
to
unify
what
does
it
mean
to
really
be
the
breath
that
the
breath
breathes
itself
to
really
be
mu
is
it
an
idea
is
it
a
physical
transformation
is
it
some
of
these
things
that
are
described
here
as
having
visions
leading
an
idle
dreamy
and
selfish
life
being
in
tune
with
the
infinite
it
means
none
of
those
things
the
minute we
begin to
talk
about
it
the
words
and
ideas
themselves
separate
us
from
it
the
moment
a single
thought
arises
heaven
and earth
are
separated
and it
is no
longer
possible
to speak
of
intimacy
union
what we're
speaking of
is the
words
and the
ideas
that
describe
that
reality
but
it's
not
yet
the
reality
realized
by
thousands
of
sages
of
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
she
tells a
little
story
here
about
these
she
refers
to
it
as
an
old
story
I
never
heard
it
before
the
old
story
of
eyes
and
no
eyes
and
she
says
it's
really
the
story
of
the
mystical
and
unmystical
types
no
eyes
has
fixed
his
attention
on
the
fact
that
he
is
obliged
to
take
a
walk
for
him
the
chief
factor
of
existence
is
his
own
movement
along
the
road
a
movement
which
he
intends
to
accomplish
as
efficiently
and
as
comfortably
as
he
can
he
asks
not
to
know
what
may
be
on
either
side
of
the
hedges
he
ignores
the
caress
of
the
wind
until
it
threatens
to
remove
his
hat
he
trudges
along
steadily
diligently
avoiding
the
muddy
pools
but
oblivious
of
the
light
which
they
reflect
eyes
takes
a walk
too
and
for him
it's a
perpetual
revelation
of the
beauty
and
wonder
the
sunlight
inebriates
him
the
winds
delight
him
the
very
effort
of the
journey
is a
joy
magical
presence
throng
the
roadside
or
cry
salutations
to him
from
hidden
fields
the
rich
world
for which
he
move
lies
in the
foreground
of his
consciousness
and it
gives up
new
secrets
to him
at every
step
no
eyes
when
told
of his
adventures
usually
refuses
to
believe
that
both
have
gone
by
the
same
road
he
fancies
that
his
companion
has
been
floating
about
in the
air
or
beset
by
an
agreeable
hallucination
we
shall
never
persuade
him
to
the
contrary
unless
we
persuade
him
to
look
for
himself
even
the
Buddha
couldn't
give it
to
you
ten
thousand
Buddhas
stacked
one
on top
of the
other
couldn't
give it
to
you
and
moreover
you
couldn't
receive
it
and the
reason it
cannot be
given
or cannot
be
received
it's
because
already
it's the
life of
each
one
of us
we
were born
with
it
it's
part of
the
human
journey
not
something
that's
only
for
a
handful
of
special
people
but
somehow
we don't
believe
that
somehow
we don't
believe
that that
which we
search for
is already
our life
and so
the journey
continues
the more
we look
the further
astray
from the
truth
we move
and that's
why
zazen
is what
it is
turning
inward
going deep
within
yourself
peeling back
the layers
of conditioning
that separate
us
from our
true
self
layer
by layer
the
conditioning
of our
parents
and teachers
of our
culture
education
our
peers
the words
and the
ideas
and finally
reach that
ground of
being
and what
is that
ground of
being
it's
being
itself
with the
whole body
and mind
that's
the place
that in
Zen mysticism
we speak
of as no
eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
or mind
and that's
the place
from which
the real
journey
begins
the descent
from the
mountain
the
manifestation
of that
in the
world
in the
world
of
things
in his
pointer
master
master
engel
says
jade
is tested
by fire
gold
by stone
sword
by hair
water
by a
staff
the degree
of one's
attainment
and one's
progress
is known
by one's
words and
phrases
attitudes
and actions
coming
and going
asking
and responding
in short
it's all
revealed
in how we
live our
life
how we
drive a
car
raise a
child
and then
he presents
an example
of how
this is
done
how
it's
revealed
in everything
we do
and say
and for
that purpose
he uses
two people
Hofoku
who was a
young monk
in his
twenties
and
Choke
and also
Kyose
they're all
disciples
of
Seppo
and they
were going
for a walk
Choke
and Hofoku
the elder
brother
and the
younger
brother
and at
one point
during the
walk
Hofoku
points to
the ground
where he
was standing
and said
right here
is the
summit
of the
great
mystic
peak
and Choke
looked at
him
and said
indeed
it is
what a
pity
footnote
to that
comment
says
if you
don't
have
iron
eyes
or
brass
eyes
you'll
probably
be
confused
those
with the
same
disease
sympathize
with
each
other
two
men
are
buried
in
the
same
hole
yet
there's
a
difference
between
these
two
and
Setyo
attempting to
clarify
it
said
today
what's
the
purpose
of
traveling
the
mountains
together
with
these
fellows
and
and then
again
he said
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
hence
I
don't
say
there
are
none
just
that
there
will
be
few
and
what he's
talking about
is of course
those
who have
realized
this
truth
that
Hofoku
was
pointing
to
but
there's
more
to it
later
this
same
dialogue
was
quoted
to
master
Kyose
Kyose
was again
part of
that same
lineage
when Kyose
heard it
he said
if it
hadn't
been
for
Choke
you would
have seen
skulls
covering
the fields
what he
was doing
was admiring
Choke's
comment
what a
pity
what's
the pity
the pity
as
wonderful
as it
is
is that
no
eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
mind
no
color
sound
smell
taste
touch
phenomena
no
world
of
sight
no
world
of
consciousness
doesn't
function
it
doesn't
move
it
doesn't
act
it
doesn't
hate
but it
also
doesn't
love
it
doesn't
kill
but it
also
doesn't
give
birth
and what
he's
speaking
of
is
shunyata
the
falling
away
of
body
and
mind
a
very
important
part of
the
process
very
important
to come
out of
the valley
and begin
the ascent
of the
great
mountain
and
indeed
very
difficult
you
scramble
ahead
a few
feet
and you
slide
back
you
move
ahead
and you
slide
back
you go
ahead
five
feet
slide
back
four
feet
but with
the help
of a
sangha
practice
teacher
it's
like
climbing
a
mountain
you
know
everybody
is
strung
together
all the
climbers
are
connected
by a
rope
and they
all
support
each
other
someone
slips
the person
in front
of them
and behind
them
supports
them
everybody
including
the leader
of the
climb
has the
safety
of the
entire
group
to depend
on
is safe
by
the
presence
of the
rest of
the group
by virtue
of that
connection
of course
that
connection
is one
of the
three
treasures
the
Buddha
the
Dharma
and the
Sangha
the
Buddha
the
individual
the
Dharma
the
teachings
and the
Sangha
the
community
of
practitioners
but
Buddha
also
means
all
sentient
beings
Dharma
means
the
ten
thousand
things
the
whole
phenomenal
universe
and
Sangha
is
all
beings
and
all
things
so in
a sense
Buddha
Dharma
and
Sangha
is at
once
the
whole
phenomenal
universe
and
also
nothing
but
yourself
and
so
because
Hofoku
was
obviously
stuck
on that
mountain
peak
Choke
said to
him
it's
true
what you
say
no
question
about
it
but
what a
pity
the
same
thing
came up
in another
koan
some
of you
may
remember
the
koan
with
Yakujo
a monk
once
asked
Yakujo
what is
the most
extraordinary
affair
and Yakujo
said
sitting
alone
on the
great
mystic
peak
the
monk
bowed
in
understanding
Yakujo
hit him
with a
stick
why
did
Yakujo
hit him
Yakujo's
reaction
to the
monk
was
exactly
the
same
as
Choke's
to his
younger
brother
sitting
alone
on the
great
mystic
peak
needs
yet
to be
manifested
in
activity
in a
way
Yakujo
was
testing
the
monk
the
monk
thought
he
was
testing
Yakujo
the
incentive
was in
the
hands
of
the
monk
when
he
asked
the
question
what's
the
most
extraordinary
affair
and the
minute
Yakujo
opened his
mouth
to speak
of the
great
mystic
peak
he
should
have
turned
over
his
meditation
seat
but
instead
he
bowed
so
Yakujo
acted
according
to
imperative
and
hit him
reveal
the
other
side
of
that
there
are
two
sides
to
it
one
side
is
the
absolute
and the
other
side
is
the
relative
the
truth
is to
be
found
in
neither
of
those
extremes
again
the
master
of
Rengyo
peak
Rengyo
is
called
lotus
flower
peak
he
came
forward
to
his
assembly
held
up
his
staff
held
up
his
staff
and said
to
his
disciples
when
in
olden
times
a
person
reached
the
state
of
enlightenment
why
didn't
they
remain
there
no
one
could
answer
and
so
he
replied
for
them
he
said
because
it's
of no
use
in the
course
of
life
and
again
he
asked
after
all
what
will
you
do
with
it
and
once
again
he
said
for
them
taking
no
notice
of
others
throwing
his
staff
over
his
shoulder
he
goes
straight
ahead
and
journeys
deep
into
the
recesses
of
the
hundred
thousand
mountains
those
hundred
thousand
mountains
is
this
very
life
itself
so
when
Kyosei
said
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Chokei
you
would
have
seen
skulls
covering
the
fields
those
skulls
covering
the
fields
are
dead
people
the
ones
who
have
no
eye
ear
nose
tongue
body
mind
that's
not
what
our
practice
is
all
of
the
great
mystics
in
one
way
or
another
ultimately
manifest
their
lives
in
the
world
there's
no
way
to
avoid
it
because
what
is
realized
is
that
you
are
the
world
itself
that's
what
it
means
to
see
one's
face
reflected
in
the
10,000
things
it's
kind of
interesting
when you
look at
this
when you
read these
works of
Evelyn
Underhill
since she
speaks so
much
and quotes
so much
of
other
mystics
it's very
difficult to
get a sense
of where
they leave
off and she
begins
one of
the
criticisms
I would
have
of
this
is that
she deals
basically
with
all this
beautiful
stuff
you know
indeed
it's
wonderful
you know
eyes
experiencing
all of
that
but we
should
keep
in
mind
that
eyes
is
also
experiencing
the
pain
and
confusion
of the
world
the
suffering
of all
beings
and more
than that
not just
as an
observer
but with
a whole
body
and mind
when the
monks
went to
visit
Vermilakurte
who was
sick
they asked
him why
he was
sick
he said
he's
sick
because
all
sentient
beings
are
sick
his
suffering
was the
suffering
of all
sentient
beings
and the
suffering
of all
sentient
beings
is his
suffering
there's no
way to
separate
the two
there's no
way to
separate
from beauty
and there's
no way to
separate
from ugliness
and the
truth
that is
realized
is found
in neither
of those
extremes
when love
and hate
are both
absent
the way
is clear
and undisguised
what is
that
truth
and she
begins
to
speak
and this
is
kind of
interesting
at one
point in
the book
she says
we begin
therefore
to see
that the
task of
union
with reality
will involve
certain
stages of
preparation
as well
as stages
of attainment
and at
these stages
of preparation
for some
disinterested
souls
easy and
rapid
and for
others
long and
full of
pain
may be
grouped
under
two
heads
first
the
disciplining
and
simplifying
of the
attention
which is
the essence
of
recollection
basically
she's
talking
about
awareness
concentration
next
the
disciplining
and
simplifying
of the
affections
and will
the orientation
of the
heart
which is
sometimes
called
by the
formidable
name
of
purgation
so the
practical
mysticism
of the
plain
person
will be
best
grasped
by him
in a
five-fold
scheme
of training
and growth
in which
the first
two stages
prepare the
self
for union
with reality
and the
last three
united
successively
with the
world of
becoming
the world
of being
and finally
with the
ultimate
fact
which the
philosopher
calls the
absolute
and the
religious
mystic
calls God
some
religious
mystics
call it
God
some
religious
mystics
call it
neither
being
nor
non-being
neither
absolute
nor
relative
Dogen
speaks of
it
in his
Genjo
Kahn
when he
says
all
buddhas
when all
when all
dharmas
are buddha
dharma
there are
buddhas
and creatures
two things
enlightenment
and delusion
two things
practice
and life
and death
then in the
next paragraph
he says
when the
ten thousand
things return
to the
self
there are
no buddhas
and no
creatures
no enlightenment
and no
delusion
and no
life
and no
death
and then in
the third
line he says
however
the buddha
way is
beyond
being
and non-being
therefore
there are
buddhas
and creatures
enlightenment
and delusion
life
and death
and the
training
and the way
is a long
and arduous
journey
and that's
why
at the
outset
we say
that the
essentials
are great
doubt
great faith
and great
determination
there are
many ways
to speak
of it
we can
talk about
ten stages
five stages
twenty stages
it's all
arbitrary
it doesn't
matter
there are
certain
things
that need
to be
accomplished
most
important
of all
is that
union
with
reality
true
realization
for oneself
not the
words and
ideas that
describe it
but the
actual
falling away
of body
and mind
that allows
union
intimacy
to occur
and in
that intimacy
there's no
knowing it
there's no
way to
evaluate it
there's no
way to speak
of it
to analyze
it
to judge
it
categorize
it
or systematize
it
it exists
thus
and it's
only when we
move out of
that
that we
realize
what has
transpired
but that's
on one
side of
the balance
that's
the great
mystic
peak
and that's
the pity
that
Choke was
speaking of
in the
poem
to this
column
Setsho
says
this is
the great
mystic
peak
now
weeds
grow
rampant
weeds
growing
rampant
weeds
are the
weeds
of
delusion
just
by
opening
his
stinking
mouth
and
pointing
he's
defiled
it
it's
no longer
it
the minute
you say
I've got
it
it's
gone
you've
missed
it
because
it's
nothing
to do
with
ideas
with
words
with
descriptions
it's
the truth
itself
the reality
itself
the second
line says
you see
it
clearly
but to
whom
could
you
impart
it
can't
be
imparted
can't
be
given
and
can't
be
received
in
fact
dead
men
can
teach
they
make
a
living
in
a
ghost
cave
no
communication
whatsoever
is
possible
and
then
the
next
line
if
you
or
choke
didn't
discriminate
many
would
never
know
and
their
skulls
would
litter
the
field
he's
expressing
his
gratitude
to
choke
for
his
discrimination
for
his
wallowing
in the
mud
and
playing
with
mud
balls
out of
his
compassion
for
all
beings
the
valley
spirit
is
important
that's
what
Evelyn
Underhill
was
speaking
of
in
this
book
on
practical
mysticism
what
she
uses
is
some
exercises
for
people
to
get
some
sense
of
what
mystical
vision
is
about
she's
not
outlining
a course
of
study
for
a
mystic
she
makes
no
pretensions
in doing
that
this is
for
an
everyday
practical
person
to
experience
for
for
for
for
themselves
that
way
of
seeing
the
world
another
way
of
doing
it
is
the
way
of
the
mystical
experience
itself
intimacy
once
having
realized
that
which
we
call
wisdom
compassion
necessarily
follows
they're
mutually
arising
they're
codependent
wisdom
and
compassion
they
coexist
you can't
have one
without
the other
any more
than you can
have
enlightenment
without
delusion
or heaven
without
a hell
and so
that
valley
spirit
is
coming
down
off
the
mountain
manifesting
in
activity
it's
the
precepts
it's
activity
itself
it's
differentiation
it's
the
world
that we
call
samsara
and that
world
that we
call
samsara
is
none
other
samsara
is
exactly
nirvana
and
finally
she
concludes
her
little
book
with
the
following
statement
she
said
we
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
discussion
that
mysticism
was
the
art
of
union
with
reality
that
it
is
that
it
was
above
all
else
a
science
of
love
hence
the
condition
to
which
it
looks
forward
and
towards
which
the
soul
of
the
contemplative
has
been
stretching
out
is
a
condition
of
being
as
the
bodily
senses
have
been
produced
under
the
pressure
of
man's
physical
environment
and
their
true
aim
is
not
the
enhancement
of
his
pleasure
or
his
knowledge
but
a
perfecting
of
his
adjustment
to
those
aspects
of
the
natural
world
which
concern
him
so
the
use
and
meaning
of
the
spiritual
senses
are
strictly
practical
too
these
when
developed
by a
suitable
training
reveal
to
man
a
certain
measure
of
reality
not
in
order
that
he
may
gaze
upon
it
but
in
order
that
he
may
react
to
it
learn
to
live
in
with
and
for
it
growing
and
stretching
into
more
perfect
harmony
with
the
eternal
order
until
at
last
like
the
blessed
ones
of
Dante's
vision
the
clearness
of
his
flame
responds
to
the
unspeakable
radiance
of
the
enkindling
light
do
you
understand
if
you
don't
understand
then
look
at
September
see
October
green
mountains
transformed
into
red
and
gold
yellow
leaves
filling
the
valley
streams
outside
of
this
not
a
single
thing
so
I
said
yes
and
yes
I
I
I
I
