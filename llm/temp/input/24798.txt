Satsang with Mooji
In the book of Equinimity
I always admire the novel devices of Unman
All his life he pulled out the nails and wedges for people
Why did he sometimes open the door
And set out a bowl of glue
Or dig a pitfall in the middle of the road
Try to understand this
The main case
A monk asked Unman
When not producing a single thought
Is there any fault or not?
Not producing a single thought
Unman's gift of teaching
Is not stingy in intent
If you come with acceptance
He imparts it with both hands
If you go on doubting it's so high you can't get a hold
The blue ocean is wide
The white clouds are peaceful
Don't put so much as the tip of a hair in there
A phony cock crow can hardly fool me
I still won't agree to let you pass
The preface The Great Master
Very novel
And Unman and Joshu are both known for what's called lips and mouth zen
Where their words kept going to see Unman
And it was kind of like getting the door slammed into space
He decided to make a move
So when the door opened
So Unman did an occasion
His life was a pretty remarkable one
He's a successor of Master Seppo
So he's in that Seppo lineage
And he's in the same bloodline
After his study with
It's kind of interesting
It shows all
He finally ended up with Master Seppo
And at that time Seppo had a huge monastery
And several great masters
So Unman's Dharma brothers were all very well known to us
There were people like Gensha
Kyose, Choke, Hofoku, Zui Gan
All of whom one way or another made a name for themselves
With their teachings
And thousands of monks and lay practitioners
Studying at Seppo's monastery
And one of the characteristics of that group of Dharma siblings
Is that they would always work with each other
Also
Unman taught
Took over a monastery that
He was the head monk for
And the head of that monastery had a nice relationship
With the emperor
And then when the old man died
Unman took over
The emperor
Took a liking to Unman
And gave him all kinds
For a while
But the monastery
Had been
Because of all this recognition by the emperor
A lot of people started coming there
And there was a steady stream
Of visitors
And so the emperor
Led him
And at one point
The emperor
Called him
To the palace
The emperor said
What's Zen all about?
And Unman said
Your majesty has the question
The emperor said
What answer?
And Unman said
I request your ma...
The emperor kind of liked it
And said
I know your personal precepts
And I have respected it
For a long time
And he appointed him
Office of the Inspector of Monks
Of the Capital
That was his title
And when he announced that
To Unman
Unman didn't say anything
And
That was the path
He's not likely to enjoy
Rising to a high post
The emperor said
Shall we let you return
To your mountain?
And at that
From his silence
Absolute silence
Unman
Jumped up and down
And shouted three times
In joy
So
The emperor gave him
All kinds of goods
From the treasury
And incense
And medicinal herbs
And donations
And gave him another title
Called genuine truth
And
Let him go back
To his monastery
And from then on in
Was a patron
And so
His life went on
He had many successes
He had taught for
I forget how many years
He was in his slate
He was 79
And
There's a stone inscription
That gives the account
Of his death
When the attendant
Offered him
A hot broth
The master handed
The bowl back
And said
First
First
I'm fine
Second
You're fine
And be sure to write
A letter
To request my leave
From the emperor
And then
He himself
Wrote a document
With his
The reason
I'm telling you
This stuff
Is that
The joy
Of studying
These records
Of the ancient
Masters
These koans
Which is
After all
Person
Cleared their throat
Or gestured
Their
Personal
Stuff
Is what I have
A sense of
And it's so much
Reflected in the way
They teach
Because every one
Of these people
Taught very
Very differently
And their personality
Came out
In their teaching
And the more
You get a sense
Of a person
So it's a valuable
Thing to have a sense
Of their personality
A feel
For their lives
What their life
Was like
So he wrote
This little
Admissions
For posterity
Which went
Something like
The following
After my death
I permit
Neither the wearing
Of mourning
Clothes
In conformity
With worldly
Custom
Nor wailing
And holding
A ceremony
With a funeral
Carriage
This would be
A violation
Of the Buddhist
Precepts
And a source
Of trouble
For the Zen
School
He then
Transmitted
The Dharma
To one of
His successors
And
Oh
The boat
Of compassion
Having been
Destroyed
Samsara
Will not
Attain
The shore
Of salvation
The Dharma
Mountain
Having crumbled
They followed
His instructions
And
Left him
In the
Sitting position
And entombed
Him
In his
In his
Quarters
That was his
Request
Don't be
Reclining
He was
The congregation
Was left
And one
Hid their
Faces
In their
Collars
And stood
Around
Crying
So
Later
And
Seventy
Seventy
Years later
Some
Emperor
Or magistrate
Umman
Appeared to
Him
In a
Dream
And instructed
Him to
Open the
Doors
To this
Place
Where he
Was
By now
Mummified
Seventy
Seventy
And it
Said that
When it
Was
Opened
The
Master's
Body
Was
Found
Unchanged
Except
That
Its
Hair
And
Fingernails
And toenails
Had grown
Longer
The
Eyes
The eyes
Were
Half
Open
And glistened
Like
Pearls
The
Teeth
Sparkled
Eyelids
Still
He
Grinned
With his
Eyes
Open
And long
Fingernails
And I'm
Sure
A glow
Filled
The room
You know
So everybody
Got excited
And they
Brought the
Mummy
To the
Capital
So all
People
Could see
It
And everything
And then
Finally when
Everybody
Had their
Fill of
It
They sent
It back
To the
Monastery
And it
Was
Kept
There
For over
A thousand
Years
And in
1970
So old
Umman
Why did
He sometimes
Oh
Gets
Stuck
And the
Pit
Compassionate
When not
Producing a
Single
Thought
Is there
Any fault
Or not
And what
The monk
Is
Saying
And one
Of the
Things
That
That's
Tough
With
Umman
Is because
So much
Of what
He says
Is based
Like
Dogen
Is based
On
His use
Of language
It becomes
Very critical
In how
The translators
Translate
And
This book
I enjoyed
Very much
And I
Have no
Way of
Evaluating
The translator
Other than
The fact
That the
Translations
Seem consistent
With the
Other translations
Of the
Koans
I don't
Particularly
Care very
Much for
His interpretation
It's wrong
It's just
That it's
Very intellectual
And there's
A whole
Other dimension
To
Umman's
Teaching
So
Not a
A fault
Or no
Fault
Is what
This monk
Is bringing
Up
We're not
Producing a
Single thought
Of course
When the
Mind is
Very quiet
Still
Focused
No
Mind
Still
Point
Is reached
No
Activity
And the
Question
The monk
Wants to
Know
Is there
Any fault
Or not
Is this
Good
Or is it
Bad
Supposedly
It
Reaches
The heavens
And covers
The earth
And
All kinds
Of
Wonderful
Stories
About
Mount
Sumeru
The national
Teacher
Commenting
On
This
Is
This
Case
Is debated
Everywhere
Some
Say
As soon
As one
Questions
In this
Way
Already
This is
Raising
A thought
And of
Course
That's
True
That's
The first
Thing
That you
See
This
Monk
Comes
Says
We're not
Producing
A single
Thought
Is there
Any fault
Or not
Well
He's
Producing
A stream
Of
Thoughts
But
Joshu
Once
Responded
To a
Similar
Thing
With
The monk
The monk
Says
How is
It
When
There
Are
No
Thoughts
Some
Say
As soon
As one
Questions
This
Way
Already
This
Is
Raising
A
Thought
A fault
As big
As
Mount
Sumeru
Some
Some
Some
Say
It
Is
Like
Mount
Sumeru
Unmoved
By
The
Eight
Winds
These
Are
Different
Ways
Of
Looking
At
This
But
The
National
Teacher
Says
Such
Such
Assessments
Have
Not
Yet
Comprehended
Umman's
Meaning
Only
If
The
Bottom
Of
The
Bucket
Has
Fallen
Out
And
The
Red
Thread
Is
Broken
Off
The
Red
Thread
Is
Referred
To
Sometimes
The
Red
Thread
Of
Passion
Or
The
Red
Thread
Of
Delusion
So
We
Get
Entangled
With
Cut
The
Thread
You
Cut
That
Loose
So
Only
Then
Will
You
Realize
It's
Not
True
That
This
Is
The
Way
Of
Understanding
Umman's
Teaching
And
Then
He
Goes
On
To
Say
Haven't
You
Heard
It
Said
That
Three
Phrases
Illuminate
One
Phrase
The
One
Phrase
Illuminates
The
Three
Phrases
Three
And
One
Do
Not
Intermingle
Distinctly
Clear
The
Road
Going
Beyond
There's
Often
A
Mention
Of
Umman's
Three
Phrases
It's
Said
That
Every
Teaching
Of
Umman
Every
Phrase
That
He
Uttered
Always
Contained
Three
Phrases
One
Is
It
Touches
Reaches
The
Heaven
And
Encompasses
The
Earth
That
Is
The
Phrase
The
Single
Phrase
Immediately
Presents
The
Absolute
Basis
Of
Reality
The
Second
Is
It
Follows
The
Way
So
Not
Only
Does
It
Encompass
Heaven
And
Cover
The
Earth
It
Responds
To
The
Need
Of
The
Student
Appropriately
And
The
Third
Is
It
Cuts
Off
The
Myriad
Streams
Of
Thought
That
You
Can't
Take
Hold
Of
It
Intellectually
And
It's
True
If
You
Look
At
Uman's
Phrases
All
Three
Of
Those
Are
Always
Present
It
Always
Reveals
The
Absolute
Basis
Of
Reality
It
It
Always
Is
Appropriate
To
The
Particular
Questioner
In
The
Koan
And
It
Always
Is
Incomprehensible
That's
What
It
Means
Cuts
Off
The
Myriad
Streams
Of
Thoughts
Means
You
Can't
Grasp
It
Intellectually
It's
Not
An
Idea
It's
Not
About
The
Words
And
Ideas
That
Describe
Reality
It's
The
Direct
Reality
Itself
So
This
Is
No
Different
Mount
Sumeru
Another
Master
Said
Uman's
Answer
Has
Provoked
Conscious
Feelings
In
Many
People
I
Say
He
Uses
Conscious
Feelings
To
Get
Rid
Of
Conscious
Feelings
If
He
Did
Not
Help
People
In
A
Great
Way
He
Would
Be
Unable
To
Do
Anything
At
All
So
He
Uses
Conscious
Feelings
To
Get
Rid
Of
Conscious
Feelings
That
Is
He
Uses
Words
To
Dispel
Words
Seeing
The
Cage
He
Builds
A
Cage
So
This
Mount
Sumeru
That
He
Says
Can
Can
Can
Be
Covered
By
The
Heavens
By
The
Sky
Earth
Cannot
Support
It
Fills
The
Universe
Wind
Blowing
Cannot
Enter
It
Water
Pour
On
It
Cannot
Wet
It
Only
The diamond
Eye
Can
See
It
At
A
Glance
To
Wrote
A
Poem
About
It
And
He
Says
Mount
Sumeru
It
Fills
The
Universe
Even
The
Ten
Thousand
Armed
Great
Compassionate
One
Cannot
See
Through
It
If
You
Know
On
Your
Own
How
To
Ride
An
Ox
Backward
You'll
Never
Stick
Facing
The
Direction
That
The
Ox
Is
Moving
In
And
This
Image
Of
Riding
The
Back
The
Ox
Backward
In
The
Phrase
Usually
Goes
Riding
The
Ox
Backward
Into
The
Buddha
Hall
The
Hall
Of
Buddhas
Is
An
Expression
Of
Freedom
Of
Being
Able
To
Manifest
Any
Which
Way
In
According
To
The
Circumstances
And
If
You
Can
Do
That
That
Is
If
You're
Free
You'll
Never
And
In
The
Verse
To
This
Coan
It
Says
Not
Producing
A
Single
Thought
Mount
Sumeru
Footnote
To
That
Line
Says
Finish
In
One
Line
Right
There
In
That
Poem
In
That
Verse
Not
Producing
A
Single
Thought
Mount
Sumeru
Says
The
Whole
Thing
Finishes
The
Corn
Umman's
Gift
Of
Teaching
Is
Not
Stim
In
Fact
He's
Given
Everything
He's
Held
Back
Absolutely
Nothing
And
Then
The
Next
Couple
Lines
Tell
You
What's
Necessary
In
Order
To
Appreciate
It
If
You
Come
With
Acceptance
He
Imparts
It
With
Both
Hands
Footnote
To
That
Says
I'm
Only
Afraid
You
Can't
Take
It
On
What's
He
Giving
You
The
Whole
Universe
Is
What
He's
Given
You
The
Whole
Universe
Is
What
He's
Given
In
That
One
Phrase
Mount
Sumeru
If
You
Go
On
Doubting
It's
So
High
You
Can't
Take
Hold
Of
It
So
When
You
Separate
Yourself
In
The
Doubting
There's
Separation
There's
You
And
It
Then
It's
In
The
Phrase
If
You
Go
On
Doubting
It's
So
High
You
Can't
Get
Hold
Of
It
The
Footnote
To
That
Says
It's
A
Wasted
Effort
Floods
The
Heavens
Bades
The
Sun
It's
So
Wide
That
It
Has
No
Shoreline
It
Reaches
Everywhere
The
White
Clouds
Are
Peaceful
Follow
The
Wind
Don't
Put
So
Much
As
The
Tip
Of
A
Hair
In
There
The
Moment
You
Add
Anything
Extra
To
It
The
Moment
You
Try
To
Name
It
The
Moment
You
Define
It
If
You
Come
With
Acceptance
He
Imparts
It
With
Both
Hands
An old
Master
Said
Wait
Until
To
The

To
The
Teacher
Koan
To
The
Teacher
Teacher
To
The
Student
All
Has
To
Do
With
Developing
Intimacy
Getting
To
That
When
The
Student
Sees
The
Koan
The
Student
Meets
Themselves
And
At
That
Very
Moment
The
Teacher
Meets
Themselves
And
At
That
Very
Moment
The
Teacher
Meets
The
Student
I
Still
Won't
Agree
To
Let
You
Pass
Through
The
Gate
In
Confusion
And
The
Phony
Cock
Crow
Is
About
To
Do
With
An
Old
Story
About
A
Couple
Of
People
Sneaking
Out
Of
The
Kingdom
In
order
To
Get
Through
The
Gate
The
Pass
They
Were
Only
Allowed
To
Pass
Through
When
The
Cock
Crow
And
All
The
Hens
Responded
And
When
Not
Producing
A
Single
Thought
Is
There
Any
Fault
Or
Not
The
Commentary
Says
A
Fellow
Whose
Words
Are
Pure
But
Whose
Conduct
Is
Impure
The
Words
Sound
Good
But
There's
Nothing
Underneath
It
It's
One
Thing
To
Be
Able
To
Say
It
And
Quite
Another
To
Be
Able
To
Be
It
So
Down
Further
The
Phony
Cock
Crow
Can
Hardly
Fool
Me
Is
That
Student
Look
Like
A
Rooster
And
Crow
Like
A
Rooster
And
Waddle
Like
A
Rooster
But
He's
Not
A
Rooster
And
Then
The
Last
Line
I
Still
Want
To
Be
Able
To
Nourish
Yourself
And
To
Nourish
Others
If
You
Come
With
Acceptance
He Imports
It
With
Both
Hands
If
You
Come
With
The
Whole
Body
And
Mind
You'll
Immediately
Realize
He's
Got
Nothing
To
Give
Good
Advice
For
Working
On
Any
Form
Go
To
It
With
The
Whole
Body
And
Mind
And
You'll
Receive
It
With
Both
Hands
Without
Any
In
Go
On
Thinking
And
It
Becomes
A
Gigantic
Barrier
That
Touches
The
Whole
Body
And
Mind
You
Become
The
Barrier
That
Collected
Hong
Ji
That
Collected
Made
This
Collection
Shared
That
Reality
In
One
Of
The
Person
That
Added
The
Commentary
The
Comments
Same
Thing
What
What
Is
That
Reality
Joshua
Said
Cypress
Tree
In
The
Garden
Oman
Said
Rice
Cakes
Another
Time
He
Said
The
Flowering
Hedge
Rinzai
Last
Night
It
Would
Keep
In
Mind
How
Different
People
See
Things
How
Different
People
May
See
The
Same
Thing
Is
Different
But
Is
That
Because
Or
That
The
Same
Thing
Appears
Differently
To
Different
People
There
Are
Many
Ways
Of
Seeing
These
Koans
That's
Why
The
Whole
Notion
Of
An
Answer
To
Koan
Book
That
Appeared
Some
Years
Ago
Is
Ridiculous
As
If
There
Were
An
Answer
There
Are
A
Hundred
Ways
Two
Hundred
Ways
Of
Seeing
Any
One
Koan
And
There
Are
Many
Levels
Of
It
And
Different
Teachers
Will
Point
Out
Different
Aspects
Of
It
According
To
Whatever
The
Circumstances
Are
That
They
Using
It
In
Teaching
Many
Times
Uman
Would
Take
Up
A
Koan
Of
Another
Master
And
Give
A
Whole
Different
Side
To
It
It
Wasn't
That
What
The
Master
Said
Was
Wrong
And
The
Oman
Said
Was
Right
It
Was
Just
Another
Way
Of
Seeing
Exactly
The
Same
Thing
Sometimes
Right
Within
The
Same
Teacher
They
Would
Give
Two
Different
Answers
But
The
Same
Truth
Was
Functioning
We
We
We
Need
To
Appreciate
That
Fact
And
Not
Get
Hooked
On
The
Right
Answer
To
A
Koan
The
Right
Answer
In
A
Very
Deliberate
Way
It's
Always
Covered
In
The
Mist
So
That
You
Stumble
And
Find
Your
Way
And
It's
Not
Only
Important
To
Ascend
That
Mountain
When
People
Ask
Me
What
Does
This
Sitting
Have
To
Do
With
My
Life
And
The
Problems
I
Have
At
The
Office
And
Stuff
Like
That
Or
What
Do
Koans
Have
To
Do
With
Life
I
Don't
Know
Whether
That
We're
Involved
In
A
Process
That
Touches
Every
Aspect
Of
Our
Life
But
You
Got
To
Make
The
Connection
Yourself
In
Your
Life
All
These
Hassles
In
The
World
Well
We
Do
Our
Best
To
Create
Hassles
For
You
Here
So
That
You
Have
The
Opportunity
To
See
How
To
Work
Your
Way
Through
It
Well
All
Kinds
Of
Anger
At
Work
Well
We
Try
To
Do
That
Here
And
It's
Much
Easier
And
Safer
To
Work
It
Out
In
The
Button
Get
A
Book
That
Hasn't
Been
Written
You're
Writing
It
As
You
Practice
And
If
You're
Not
Connecting
It
With
Your
Life
If
You're
Spending
All
This
Time
Sitting
And
Working
With
Koans
And
Studying
And
You're
Not
Connecting
It
With
Your
Life
You're
Oh
That
