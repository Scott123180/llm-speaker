all of the things that were causing the problems in your life before are still with you.
And in the process of working through them here,
you begin to see them, and little by little over a course of years of training,
you're able to turn it around, ultimately.
So it's not so unusual that the monks of the East Hall and the West Hall were arguing.
And it's not so unusual that Nansen would have taken some drastic measures like that.
Things were very different in the way you trained monks in China
than the way you train monks today.
Can you imagine you guys arguing about Chloe, and I cut her in half?
The ASPCA would be here, the sheriff would be here, I'd be sued,
and probably strung up by the very monks that I'm trying to send a message to.
So it doesn't work.
But the principle is the same.
What Nansen was revealing and what Joshu was revealing is revealed again and again.
And that has to do with how do you resolve conflicts?
How do you resolve the dualities?
What do you do when you come right up against a brick wall?
How do you get by it?
Do you ignore it?
Do you run away from it?
Do you deny it?
Do you become it?
Do you knock it down?
Do you climb over it?
What are the possibilities?
First off, Engel tells us that
where the road of ideation cannot reach,
that's just right to bring to your attention.
So what he's basically saying is that what he's bringing to our attention here
is something that can't be reached by words and ideas.
Where verbal explanation cannot reach,
you must set your eyes on it quickly
because it's instant.
It's an action.
And it's not something you can talk about and reflect on later.
The minute it's gone, it's gone.
And the words and ideas that remain that describe it's not it.
So you're left holding on to the description,
but the reality has been missed.
And the description just doesn't cut it.
You know, it's one thing to say something
and it's quite another to do it.
I was very interested in the survival workshop.
I was in and out of both the workshops this weekend,
interested in hearing what was going on.
And I heard several interesting things,
saw several interesting things.
One is in the survival thing,
number one or two at the top of this list of things
that you need to do in order to survive
was vanquish all panic.
And then he goes on to say,
you know, then size up the situation,
then do this, then do that, and do that.
Vanquish all panic was number one.
How?
How?
How do you do that?
When you're scared out of your wits,
when you're like that guy in the Jack London story
who fell through the ice, he's soaking wet,
he knows he's going to be dead in three minutes,
he's trying to light a fire.
How do you vanquish fear?
It doesn't matter all the other things that follow that.
You can have all the skills up to gazoo
and all the equipment up to gazoo.
But if you're scared out of your wits,
you can't use it.
You can be the finest karate practitioner
on the face of the earth.
But if you're afraid of death,
if you haven't resolved the question of life and death,
it's useless, absolutely useless.
So how do you take care of that number one thing?
Vanquish all fear.
Or anger.
Same can be said for anger.
An angry karate student is useless.
But you lose all of your skills with anger.
And greed is the same thing.
Those poisons poison everything.
How do you deal with that?
How do you turn it around?
And so he brings up
this old case of nonsense.
And let me give you the footnotes.
Engel also adds little footnotes
to help you understand this line by line.
The first line, it says,
That nonsense place one day
the monks of the Eastern and Western halls
were arguing about a cat.
And the footnote says,
It's not just today.
It's not just today
that they're haggling together.
This is a case of degeneracy.
Eastern and Western halls
are the administrative wing
of the monastery
and the practice wing,
the training wing of the monastery.
Evidently, there was a monastery cat.
And the administrators
wanted the cat in the office
to take care of the mice there.
And the training people
wanted the cat in the training hall.
So I guess they were arguing over it.
And it's mine or it's mine.
Or it's good or it's bad.
Or it's heaven or it's hurt.
Earth, it's male or it's female.
It's absolute or it's relative.
All of those dualities.
How do you resolve them?
So Nansen took the subject
of this discussion,
the cat,
and held it up and said,
If you can say a word of Zen,
I won't kill it.
The footnote says,
When the true imperative
goes into effect,
the ten directions are subdued.
This old fellow has the capability
to distinguish dragons from snakes.
The ten directions are subdued
means things return
to the absolute basis of reality.
He has the capability
of distinguishing dragons from snakes.
Dragons are enlightened beings.
Snakes are deluded beings.
And he's seeing them.
He's seeing who's enlightened,
who's deluded.
No one in the community replied.
The footnote says,
What a pity to let him go.
What a pity to let Nansen go.
A bunch of lacquered tubs.
What are they worth?
Phony Zen followers
are as plentiful as hemp and millet.
It's easy to talk about it.
It's easy to use the words and ideas
that describe reality.
It's quite another thing
to have manifested that reality
with your own life.
There are plenty of books about Zen
to read.
And people read them.
We gobble them up.
We're an intellectual society.
And we're really convinced
that if you can read it
and say it,
you know it.
You understand it.
And it's easy to get away with it
with something like Zen.
Because the only one
you're fooling is yourself.
And when all hell breaks loose,
you realize that
you don't have
what it takes
to be able to be
in peace and harmony
in when all hell breaks loose.
It's a little bit less
easy to fool yourself
if your practice
is something like karate.
You know,
you can read a book on karate
and convince yourself
that you're really good.
But when you come up
against somebody else
who has been practicing,
you find out.
Try it sometimes
with tennis
or softball
or something else.
Try reading a book
and mastering it.
You have to do it.
To practice is to do.
To train is to do.
All the rest of it
is the words and ideas
that describe the doing.
No matter how wonderful,
eloquent,
charismatic
those words may be,
if they're not part
of the substance
of your life,
the very pores
of your skin
and blood
and bones,
then it's not yours.
It belongs to somebody else
and you're the parrot.
So how do you make it your own?
Nansen cut the cat
in two pieces.
Footnote says,
How quick!
How quick!
If he hadn't acted like this,
there would all be fellows
playing with a mud ball.
He draws the bow
after the thief is gone.
Already this is secondary.
He should have been hit
before he even picked it up.
Master,
Engel says,
Now you tell me,
after all,
who was it
that killed the cat?
And he said,
If there was suddenly
someone who could speak,
would Nansen
have killed it or not?
Of course he wouldn't have.
Couldn't have.
He goes on to say,
When the true imperative
goes into effect,
the ten directions
are subdued.
Stick your head out
beyond the heavens
and look
who's there.
That was always something
that intrigued
the hell out of me.
Sticking your head out
beyond the heavens.
You know,
imagining
infinity
when I was a kid
and I read
that it meant
no edges,
boundless,
no end to it.
And trying to imagine
what contains that.
Of course,
nothing contains that.
But where is the end of it?
There is no end to it.
Could you
look beyond that?
Stick your head
outside of it.
He's saying,
Stick your head
outside of it.
What do you see there?
Well,
if you see your own face,
then you see
how to resolve
this problem
of saving the cat.
If what you see
is the void,
or what you see
is more
of what you're
standing in,
then there's no way
in hell
that you're going
to save the cat
or yourself.
Dingo goes on
to say,
The fact is
at that time
he really didn't kill.
The story
has nothing to do
with killing
or not killing.
The answers
are not
to be found
in emotions
or opinions.
To go to that,
you just go against
the whole point
of what nonsense
is trying to show us.
Engel says,
Just see it
on the edge
of the knife.
If it exists,
fine.
If it doesn't exist,
that's all right too.
If it neither exists
nor doesn't exist,
that's also all right.
What does he mean?
Right there
is the answer
to this con.
An old master
said,
When at an impasse,
change.
When you change,
then you can
pass through.
People nowadays
don't know
how to change
and pass through.
They only
go running
to the spoken words.
And he goes on
to say,
When Nansen
held up the cat
this way,
he could not
have been telling
people they should
be able to say
something.
He just wanted
people to attain
it on their own,
each act on their own,
and to know
for themselves.
And there's
the key here.
There's the key
to the whole practice.
A big difference
between knowing it
and realizing it.
Some of you
I told a story
to some years
ago when I was
doing con study
with,
we were on the road,
I was on the road
with my normal
brother,
Tets again,
and he had already
completed con study
and I was away
from my teacher.
So I was doing
con study with him
while we were
doing sessions
around the country.
And there was a
con very similar
to this.
And the point
of the con
was to turn it
around.
There was no
question that was
the point of the
con.
And I had been
doing con study
for a number
of years.
These were
advanced cons.
I knew what
the point of the
con was.
There was no
question about it.
And I went to
Doksan.
I was also his
attendant, so I
could go into
Doksan as much
as I wanted.
I went to Doksan
and I presented
my understanding
of the con
concerning
turning it
around.
And he looked
at me and
made this awful
face that I
wanted to punch
out.
He said,
wrong.
I said,
what?
It's not wrong.
And he rang
his bell,
wrong.
And I went
out infuriated
because I knew
I was right
and he was
wrong.
And I went
back to the
book and I
read it again
and I was even
more convinced
and I went
back on the
line again
and I went
in and I
changed my
presentation
slightly and
gave it to him
again.
He said,
wrong.
I said,
it's right.
He said,
wrong.
And he rang
the bell.
And I went
back out again
and I sat
infuriated on
that line
trying to
freak out.
And I knew
that if I had
gone to my
teacher,
my Zumi Roshi,
he would have
passed me on
that presentation.
I knew it.
Or if I went
to any other
teacher,
that I would
have been
passing on.
Why wasn't
he passing me
on this?
I was
right.
No question
about it.
I mean,
if Buddha
was there,
he would have
known I was
right.
And I got
back on the
line again.
And I went
in there and I
was going to
change it again.
and I presented
it to him and
he said,
wrong.
I said,
but I'm
right.
He said,
you're wrong.
And he rang
the bell.
And I went
back out.
I mean,
it was lunchtime
was next.
I was doing a
session.
I couldn't
eat.
I was just
choked in my
throat.
This colon was
stuck.
And things
started again
sitting in the
afternoon.
I didn't
rest.
I was just
consumed by this
colon.
colon and
the fact that
I knew I was
right.
And could he
be wrong?
You know,
he was a
teacher.
He was a
senior.
Maybe he
didn't understand
this colon.
All these
things were
going through
my mind.
And I sat
with that
colon and I
sat and I
sat and
then I saw
it.
And I went
into that
room and I
said to him,
I'm wrong.
He said,
right.
All he
wanted me to
do was not
say turn it
around, but
to be able to
turn it around
and to be able
to turn it
around when
you're right,
when you're
absolutely right
to turn it
around.
That's the most
difficult thing
to do.
We'd rather
die before
we'll do
that.
Very
interesting.
One was an
intellectual
understanding of
that colon,
the other was
with the whole
body and
mind, letting
it go,
turning it
around.
In the
verse,
in both
halls there
are phony
Zen
followers.
Stirring up
smoke and
dust, they're
helpless.
Fortunately,
there's
Nansen who
was able to
uphold the
command.
With one
stroke of
the knife, he
cuts two
pieces, letting
them be
lopsided as
they may.
so he
says, in
both halls
there are
phony Zen
followers.
In other
words, all
of these
monks, and
Nansen had
probably close
to a
thousand of
them, East
Hall and
West
Hall, none
of them
could do
anything
when
smoke and
dust is
raised.
In other
words, in
the midst
of actual
battle, in
a real
situation, none
of them, with
all their
compassion, could
save the
cat.
There wasn't a
damn thing they
could do about
it, because it
was all up in
their heads.
And then he
says, with one
stroke of the
knife, he
cuts into two
pieces, letting
them be
lopsided as
they may.
And that's
kind of an
interesting one,
letting them be
lopsided.
knowing how
to fail,
knowing how
to fail.
I mean, Nansen
didn't enlighten
anybody, didn't
enlighten anybody.
Killed this
poor cat, and
nobody learned
anything.
What a shame.
They were still
as lopsided as
they were when
they started.
It's my cat,
it's my cat.
But neither
one of them
saw it, and
essentially,
Nansen
failed.
That's kind
of interesting.
We fail all
the time.
One of the
first things
you learn
when you
practice, for
example, the
martial arts, is
how to fail, how
to fall.
If you don't
know how to
fall, you
have big
troubles.
But also, part
of our
practice is
knowing how to
fall.
That is, knowing
how to fail.
We all know how
to succeed, and
that's what we
want, but nobody
knows how to
fail.
It's got to
be, oh, you
got to give
yourself permission.
Otherwise, you
have no courage.
Otherwise, you
have no power.
You have to
give yourself
permission to
succeed, that's
okay, no big
deal, or fail,
that's okay, no
big deal.
Either way, you're
the one that
empowers that.
Nobody else can
say it.
Nobody can come
and tell you,
no, no, it's
okay.
You didn't
make it, but
it's okay, dear.
It'll work out
the next time.
It's okay to
fail.
Only you can
give yourself
permission for
that.
Of course,
Nansen had no
problem with
it.
Then, later
on, Joshua,
who was his
number one
ace monk
of all times,
Joshua stayed
with Nansen
many, many
years.
He came to
Nansen at
age 18.
He was
enlightened by
20.
He stayed
with Nansen
until he was
60, until
Nansen died.
Joshua buried
him and then
stayed a few
years more.
Then, finally,
he went out on
pilgrimages until
he was 80,
visiting all the
monasteries,
refining and
perfecting his
understanding.
Then, he began
teaching at
80.
And he lived
to 120.
An extraordinary
teacher.
So, this was
sometime during
the time that
he was still
with Nansen,
a very, very
mature and
ripe adept.
He had been
away while this
whole thing
took place.
And when he
returned, and
one of the
interesting things
is, is we
should appreciate,
we should
appreciate the
fact that
Nansen and
Joshu's way of
perceiving reality
were identical.
That's teacher-student
identification.
But Nansen
wasn't
Joshu, and
Joshu wasn't
Nansen, any more
than Nansen was
like Basso.
people get this
confused idea
that somehow
personality is
transformed.
I never realized
how prevalent
that is, and
how much
the fears that
people have in
forgetting the
self have to do
with thinking that
their personality is
going to change.
I didn't realize
that until I
started reading
this book,
Zen in
America.
In each of
these different
centers that
they were, this
woman was
talking to
students, that
same thing was
coming up.
These expectations
that a teacher's
personality somehow
would get wiped
out when they
become enlightened,
when they become
realized.
And it's not
the case.
And I've
mentioned it
before, again
and again.
If you were an
asshole before
enlightenment, you're
an enlightened
asshole after
the fact.
Nothing changes
in terms of
your basic way
of functioning
in the world.
The things that
you are addicted
to, the things
that you like,
the things that
you didn't like,
are still going
to be there.
Your way of
doing things,
your way of
speaking, of
relating, are
still going to
be, that's
personality.
But your way
of perceiving
yourself and
the universe,
that's transformed.
So the way you
understand the
universe is
functioning is
very, very
different than
it was before
you realized
yourself.
That's the
place that
the change
happens.
You can say,
well, you
know, if that
happens and you
realize all
things are one,
people ask me
all the time,
why do you
smoke?
You know, I
asked the same
question to my
physician down
the street here
in Phoenicia.
He smokes three
packs of cigarettes
a day.
He's a doctor.
You know, he
coughs, and he's
got a cigarette
hanging out of
his mouth.
If anybody knows
about it, he
knows, medically,
scientifically, and
so on.
Obviously, it's
stupid to do
it.
And if he was
stupid before,
he's stupid
afterwards.
It doesn't make
you smart.
It just changes
your way of
perceiving the
universe.
In fact, it may
even be worse
because the fear
of death, which
is an incentive
for a lot of
people, is not
there.
So it may be
even worse.
But that's
another story.
So, Nansen
recites the
preceding story
to Joshu.
Joshu immediately
took off his
straw sandals,
placed them on
his head, and
left.
Nansen said,
if you'd been
here, you could
have saved the
cat.
Now, what was
that all about?
I mean, this
whole thing from
a casual observer
must seem a
little crazy.
You know,
first the master
cuts the cat
in half, and
he asks his
top disciple,
what would
you have
done?
He puts
his shoes
on his
head and
leaves, and
the whole
thing is
resolved.
That's why
Zen teachers
get this
reputation for
being a
little bit
crazy.
But it's
not crazy.
It's all
very, very
clear and
very, very
direct once
you've
abandoned your
reference
system.
And the
problem is
the reference
system.
And that
reference
system, the
self, makes
all the
difference in
the world.
You know, I
was thinking
right before we
came in here,
several people
told me that I
should tell more
stories when I
give a talk,
that the talks
sound better if I
tell stories.
I have another
story for you.
And it has to
do with
compassion, wisdom
and compassion.
You know,
compassion comes
out of wisdom.
compassion is
the action of
wisdom.
And what
wisdom is, is
realizing that
there's no
separation.
Not understanding
it, not
believing it, but
realizing it, having
transformed your
way of perceiving
yourself and the
rest of the
universe so that
there's an
identity between
you and the
ten thousand
things.
And several
years ago, maybe
fifteen years
ago, we were
driving up the
coast from San
Francisco.
My son at the
time was about
five years old.
And we were
looking down at
the beautiful
Pacific Ocean, and
there was a
place where cars
were parked and
RV vehicles were
parked, and
people, kids, were
down by the
beach.
So we decided to
stop and kind of
rest.
It was a long
drive.
And we went
down onto the
beach, climbed
down these cliffs,
and we sat on
the beach, and my
son started playing
with the other
kids who ranged
in age from
about his age,
five, up to
about ten.
And there were
about ten or
twelve of these
kids.
And they were
having a great
time running out
with the receding
waves, and there
were some real
big waves there,
and then as the
wave would come in,
they would run
away from it.
And there was
also a tremendous
riptide with a,
they weren't
swimming, any of
these, they were
just playing, and
parents were there,
and a handful of
people, not very
many, and they
had a piece of
styrofoam, and
they were getting
off on throwing
the styrofoam
into the riptide
that would take
it along the
surface of the
water, just
zipping it along
crossways, and
then it would
arch out and
go really out
into the ocean,
and there was
this big whirlpool
that was there,
and the whirlpool
would suck this
thing down, and
then it would
pop up way over
here, pop up to
the surface, and
come back into
shore again, and
then they would
pick it up, and
they would run it
down to this end,
they would throw
it in, and this
was going on, and
they're laughing, and
I'm reading a
book, and we're
fully clothed and
everything, and
all of a sudden, in
the corner of my
eye, I see this
big wave coming, and
it hit my kid, and
grabbed him and
pulled him out into
the ocean, so I
dropped everything, and
I ran as fast as I
would ever run in
my life, and hit the
water swimming, and
he was out of my
reach, I could see
him tumbling in
this water, being
pulled out toward
the whirlpool, and
I swam as fully
clothed as hard as
I've ever swam in
my life, trying to
reach him before he
got to the whirlpool,
and he was always
out of reach, you
know, it was just
like a bad dream
where you just
can't do what you
need to do, and
right at the last
second, just as I
was about to grab
me, get sucked down
into the whirlpool,
and a second later, I
get sucked down into
the whirlpool, I was
prepared to die, I
mean, I wasn't going
to shore without
him, so that was
the foregone
conclusion.
We get to the
bottom of this
vortex, bouncing
around, and I feel
this body, and I
grabbed it, and the
moment I grabbed it,
and he locked his
legs around me, and
his arms around me, the
moment I grabbed it,
I realized it wasn't
my kid, it was much
too big, a body, to
be my kid, and we're
tumbling along the
bottom, and I'm
struggling to get to
the surface, and
little by little, the
thing pushes us up to
the surface, and at
that point, I looked
at the beach, and
saw my wife holding
my son, and realized,
it was confirmed, this
wasn't my kid, and
we began swimming
ashore, and finally, I
let the kid go, and
he ran off, and
everybody was happy,
and later, I started
thinking about that,
and I realized that if
I knew that that
wasn't my kid, I was
the only one that
knew this, that I
wouldn't, I would
have probably gone
after him, but when
I saw my life in
danger with the
whirlpool, I
probably would have
cut out of that, I
could have cut out of
that current, but I
thought it was my
kid, and that's the
difference between
action out of love,
that was pure love
for my son, I was
ready to lay down my
life for him, but
there's also action
out of kindness, or
social kind of thing,
you know, like helping
somebody that's in
trouble, you're willing
to do it until your
hand is burned, you
know, and then you
pull back, and that's
what I was, that's what
I would have done had I
known it was this
kid, and then there's
action out of
compassion, where there's
no self, it doesn't
matter who the person
is, or what the person
is, it can be someone
who's, you hate their
guts, when compassion is
functioning, you're
completely their body and
mind, there's no
separation, and you
act as if it were
you, you act the same
way, it's selfish, the
same way you take care
of yourself, you take
care of that person,
it's got nothing to do
with love, it's got
nothing to do with
kindness, it's got to
do with no self, that's
compassion, and that's
where these teachers are
coming from, that's
where Joshua comes from,
that's where Nansen
comes from, it goes
beyond their own body
and mine, so Nansen
recited the preceding
story to question
Joshua, Joshua
immediately took off
the straw sandals and
placed them on his
head and left, the
footnote says he does
not avoid trailing mud
and dripping water, in
other words, he's being
stinky in his attempt
to show the truth of
what has to happen, what
is it that he's
showing?
Joshua turned the
universe upside down,
in his answer, they
said that Joshua went
to the living word, not
the dead word, the
living word is his
action, he boiled
icebergs and froze
hell, he turned
everything crisscross and
upside down and
inside out, he faced
south to see the
north star, only he
didn't do it like I
did it, with an
explanation, he did it
the way my Dharma
brother was trying to
get me to do it, with a
whole body and mind, it
was really his own, not
an idea, not an
understanding, not a
belief, it was
realized.
Ingo says, you must bring
forth your own family
treasure, only then will
you see the great
function of Joshua's
total capacity.
He's saying, I am the
Dharma king, free in all
respects.
Now the Dharma king, it
comes up in one of the
sutras, the Dharma king
refers to the Buddha's
independent mastery and
use of the teachings, both
provisional or true, both
absolute or relative, in a
manner that's appropriate to
the time, the situation, and
the capacity of the hearers.
And so, from one point of
view, what Joshua did was
awful, but from the point
of view of what was taking
place, it was clear and
brilliant.
In another time, in another
situation, it would have to
be done in a very different
way.
And it's the same with the
precepts.
Always the precepts function
in terms of time, place,
position, and degree.
There's no set rules.
There's no rule book for us
to live our life by.
It has to come out of our
own understanding.
The rule book has never
been written that can
guide us in our life.
You know, there's this
book that they advertise,
Dianetics or something
like that.
It's the operating manual
for the human mind.
Horseshit.
There isn't any.
Can't be written.
Whatever you can write
about it or say about it
misses it because they're
the words and ideas that
describe reality, not the
reality itself.
The reality itself resides
in one place inside of
each one of us.
And we have to go deep
into ourselves to find
the foundations of it.
And the only way you can
do that is to get the
mind quiet so that you
can hear, feel, and
experience yourself.
Because where the
questions come from is
where the answers come
from.
And if you can't sit still
to do it, that's okay
too.
You just don't do it.
But that's the entrance.
That's the doorway.
It's the most powerful
thing that you can do
with your life.
And that is to realize
that out of that stillness
will come the resolution
of all of the questions,
all of the koans, the
koans that we create
ourselves from day to
day.
But the answers are not
in the words.
They're in the direct,
immediate, tactile,
tangible experience of the
ground of being, your
being.
In the verse, it says
the public place
completed, he questions
Joshu.
In the city of Chang'an,
he's free to wander at
leisure.
The city of Chang'an is
eternal peace, the city
of eternal peace.
It's the name of the
city.
But of course, he's
talking about
enlightenment, Joshu's
enlightenment.
That he's free to,
because of that,
wander in eternal
peace.
His straw sandals he
wears on his head,
no one understands.
Returning to his
native village, he
then rests.
So if words do not
convey the truth, and if
letters do not embody
the spirit, if to
attach to words is to
be lost, if to abide in
letters is to remain in
ignorance, then how will
you find your way?
How will you penetrate
the barrier?
How will you cast away
body and mind?
How will you be the
kohan, or be the
barrier?
Turn it around.
You'd be surprised how
easy it is to turn it
around.
You'd be surprised how
free you are to turn it
around.
Try it.
You have the power to do
it.
You have the power to
make north-south
and south-north.
Imitating Joshu won't do
it.
Saying it won't do it.
Won't help you any more
than it helped me.
Doesn't impart strength.
Believing doesn't impart
strength.
Understanding doesn't
impart strength.
But realizing it, and to
realize means to do it,
does.
And I'm sure all my
talking has led you even
further astray.
So, please, forgive me.
Do it.
Make it your own.
Thank you.
Thank you.
