Once Daido Shi's procession has arrived at the main gate, incense is offered and a purification
of the space is made by waving the hosu and offering a poem. The poem which Daido Shi
will read at the main gate is, North gate, south gate, east gate, west gate, the way of truth is
boundless, never has there been an entry point, thus I enter this mountain gate.
After his poem, he then offers powdered incense.
So let's go.
Thank you.
The Ryoban, who previously entered the main hall in Paedo Basins to Buddha, have just slightly, a few minutes ago, left to go to the main gate and to beckon Daidoshi, and they will accompany him to another site.
Thank you.

The procession will continue and then stop in front of the figure of Christ, which is carved on one side of this monastery.
Again, Raidoshi will offer one stick of incense and with the hosu purify the space
and then offer his hogo, his poem, to the figure of Christ.
Daidoshi's poem offering reads,
Mountain of heavenly light is constantly walking.
The stone woman gives birth to a child in the night.
When the mountain flower opens, here the Nazarene rises and enters the marketplace.
How can I express my gratitude?
We hear the hand clappers of the Sayu Longjin, the bowing to left and right and center.
Very shortly, the movement of the procession will be joined by the drum.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Taidoshi enters soon to make his offering to Manjushri.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Daidoshi has offered his poem
to Bodhidharma, reading
Broken-toothed old master
Deaf, dumb and blind
Compounding medicine to heal the sickness
Creating sickness to heal the medicine
After offering three bowels
he then proceeds to a small altar
made especially by the mantelpiece
along the top of which have been aligned
the photographs of the ancestors
In the middle
his living master
Maezumi Roshi
And from the left
Yasutani Roshi
And Koryu Roshi
And to the right
Dogen Zenji
And a photo of Baiyan Hakujun Dayosho
The father of the present founder
And who was also the founder of ZCLA
Daidoshi offers his poem
And closes with three bowels
The poem reads
Endless waves of Soke
Each one unique and distinct
Reaching everywhere
How can I not be grateful
Just bow and serve
Just bow and serve
The procession
Leaves the Buddha hall
And goes to the abbot's room
In the abbot's room
The seals will be inspected
By Tetsugen Sensei
And Genpo Sensei
Daidoshi will look on
And then he will offer incense
Purify the space
And offer his poem
Concerning the seals
The poem he will read
Before the examination
Of the seal
Reads
Mountain dragon
Enters the water
Parent and child
They become each other
They become each other
Tetsugen Sensei
Will then pick up
The seal
Of the abbacy
And purify it
And purify it
Over the incense
Daidoshi will then
Offer his poem
After the examination
Because it exists
Before the kalpa
Of emptiness
The seal manifests
In the present
Thus
Thus
Thus
Am
While in the abbot's room,
the daido-shi will change from a gray koromo to a brown koromo and once again
be placing the same okesa that he had been wearing before and the ryoban stand
now to greet him.
