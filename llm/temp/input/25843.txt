the morning is full of the cloud gate
on all sides I see his waste of fog
who can say if that sound echoing is bell or bird
our desire rests so snug and sure
in these vast arms of transparent stone
this morning because many of the residents seem to be living
in a kind of murky January
post-strohatsu December fog funk
I thought we would enter the cloud gate
cloud gate is actually the name
of Master Unman
that's his mountain name and his personal name when he became a teacher
taking the name of the mountain
and on all sides I see his waste of fog
waste as in the body
fog is actually a phrase from a poem by Pablo Neruda
that points in a sense to the ungraspability
of all that surrounds us
and what is surrounded
why is it ungraspable
becomes the question
it's easy to answer
because it's not outside
it's not other than us
how does the hand grasp itself
how does the eye see itself
but the cloud gate koans of Master Unman
ask us to do more than just rest
in some pretty phrases
so today's koan
is one that's familiar to many of us
it's the koan that's actually used
as a prerequisite for someone
becoming ordained in the mountains and rivers
in order to enter monastic training
as a life vow
one has to engage and realize this koan
bell sound in priest's robe
it's called
Unman said
look
this world is vast
and wide
why
when the bell rings
do you put on your priest's robe
Master Unman
is one of my favorite
of the Zen masters
that we encounter in Zen training
he's considered by many
one of the last great geniuses of Zen
I don't know if there were
minor geniuses that followed
or why they're often assumed
to have stopped
but that's often you'll see
in the writings
one of the last great Zen teachers
and he lived from 864 to 949
and he's known for his passion
it was a
kick your feet out from under you
take it all away
everything you're assuming
everything that's stopping you
put it on the line
drop it
give it all
and he's known also for his keenness of wit
and the sharpness of his intellect
so in addition to being kind of a
physical teacher
a full body teacher
he also utilized the
full scope of human intellect
and humor
in his teaching
which makes him
a good January teacher as well
seems to be one of the things
that gets forgotten
often by those
surviving January
rather than practicing it
that we must
laugh at ourselves
and Unman tends to
encourage that
rather vitally
but he doesn't do it
in a trite way
one of the comments
about his teaching
that I love is
when read
when you read his words
and you can feel
the passion in them
it's described as
when read
they scorch your eyeballs
heard
they just make your ears
drop off
so in other words
beware
watch out
Mr. Unman's teachers
in a sense
set him up
to be this kind of a
dynamo
and it's
especially to the residents
I wanted to mention
one of the factors
that contributed
to Unman's
teaching style
was that
his first teacher
was an absolute
rebel
he did the whole shtick
he did monastic training
he was the head monk
in this monastery
where Rinzai trained
under Huang Po
and then he
was done with that
he quit monasticism
he quit being a monk
he dropped all the forms
and just
did what he needed to do
and the word
that's often
used in the descriptions
of him
is flinty
you know
it's like
it's hard to bump
into this guy
but when you do
there's a spark
and when
Unman did
there was a definite spark
and there was actually
a crunching of bones
this is the teacher
that
for those of you
who are familiar
with the story
when Unman got
to the place
where this guy
was trying to just
live his life
and peace
and you know
receive as necessary
give as necessary
there was always
a line
wanting to go
into the room
with him
to see if that spark
could be ignited
in one's own
heart and mind
and Unman
finally
got to the door
and
the story
that's often told
is about him
being repeatedly
sent away
by Mu Chao
until finally
he
is being dismissed
and he sticks
his leg in the door
and Mu Chao
just slams it
full out
and as
Unman's leg
is sorely crunched
he realizes
the nature
of the universe
in himself
and goes forth
fully sparked
and free
and there's always
the caveat
this is not
the only way
but
taking full advantage
of whatever
the situation
is
the teacher teaches
but you get a sense
of
part of what
Unman
dealt with
what made him
the teacher
he became
he was not
permanently crippled
by his training
as
most of us
are not
but
it often feels
like it might
he
walked on
and found
his next teacher
to further
refine his
understanding
with
who was
the
fifth
in the lineage
of
Shittau
who many
are familiar with
and was also
regarded as
kind of a
tough old bird
so Unman
went on
to become
known
as a teacher
that
was kind of
the nuts and bolts
teacher
rather than
the
kind
obvious
feeding
and nourishing
of students
he would
feed
by taking
away
and
nourish
by insisting
on
self-reliance
self-realization
so he wasn't
an easy guy
and yet his
heart
was
unmistakable
one of the
teachings of
Unman
I wanted to
read
and we're
also very
lucky with
Unman's
teachings
because there
were very
good records
kept
and so you
get a lot
of the
very vital
picture of
those who
crowded around
him and how
their training
happened
one of Unman's
teachings says
in reality
and as you
hear his
teaching
it's important
to
hear alive
where is
he talking
about
in reality
there's not
the slightest
thing that
could be the
source of
understanding
or doubt
for you
rather you
have the one
thing that
matters
each and
every one
of you
it's the
great fun
it's great
function
manifests
without the
slightest
effort
on your
part
you're no
different
from the
ancestor
Buddha's
but since
the root
of your
faith
has always
been shallow
and the
influence
of your
selfish
actions
massive
you find
yourselves
all of a
sudden
wearing many
horns
that's an
expression used
in Buddhism
like finding
yourself deep
in the weeds
finding yourself
with horns
growing out of
your heads
when you're an
animal that
doesn't need
horns
you're in
a deluded
way
hiding yourself
from what's
real
acting in a
way that's
inappropriate
and needlessly
awkward
you're heavy
headed
and bumping
into things
suddenly wearing
many horns
you're carrying
your bowl
bags far
and wide
these are the
begging bowls
that a monk
carries
you're carrying
your bowl
bags
your few
possessions
far and wide
through thousands
of villages
and myriads
of hamlets
what's the
point of so
victimizing
yourself
is there
something
you're lacking
which one
of you
full-fledged
fellows
hasn't got
his share
though you
may accept
what I'm
saying for
yourself
you're still
in bad
shape
there's more
required
than just
believing
this
you must
neither
fall for
the tricks
of others
nor
simply
accept
their
directives
the
instant
you see
an old
monk
open her
mouth
you tend
to stuff
those big
rocks
right into
yours
and when
you cluster
in little
groups to
discuss
the words
you're
exactly like
those green
flies on
shit
that struggle
back to
back to
gobble it
all up
what a shame
the old
masters
could not
help
using up
their whole
lifetime
for the
sake of
you all
so they
dropped a
word here
and half a
phrase there
to give you
a hint
you may
have understood
these things
put them
aside
and make
some effort
for yourselves
and you
will certainly
become
a bit
familiar
with them
I love
that
it's not
that you
will astonish
the heaven
and shake
the earth
and realize
the end
to all
suffering
and flowers
will flow
out of the
palms of
your hands
but you
may become
familiar
a bit
with this
reading
hurry up
hurry up
time doesn't
wait for
anyone
and breathing
out
is no
guarantee
for breathing
in again
or
do you
have a
spare
body
and mind
to fritter
away
you
absolutely
must
pay
close
attention
take care
so this
kind of
nuts and
bolts
kick your
butt
teacher
also has
a few
sweet
morsels
as well
it's not
abusive
in the
sense
that many
people
often
misconstrues
in
it's
just
right to
the bone
take care
hurry up
unless you
happen to
have a
spare
the
gritter
away
that phrase
that's often
used in
literature
that describes
the
nourishing
grandmother
aspect
as a
grandmother
always confused
me because my
background was
very different
my grandfather
was the one
whose eyes
were always
twinkling
and would
give me
as much time
as the
universe had
he was actually
a clockmaker
and he would
take apart
clocks and
took me up in a
big clock in
halifax to
show me
what a minute
looked like
on a cog
and just
was never
short of
time or love
or giving
whereas my
grandmother
was much more
the other way
of bringing
someone into
the world
and what it
takes to live
anything you'd
say around
my grandmother
you were liable
to get the
response
now why do
you think
that
what does
that got
to do
and in
Unmon in a
sense we
get that
combination
of the
mother
and the
father
very much
alive
and we
also get a
sense to
see in this
part of
what's evident
in any
really great
spiritual teacher
when he
says the
old masters
could not
help using
up their
whole lifetime
for the sake
of you
it really
brought to
my mind
the image
that's been
on the news
lately of
Mother Teresa
in the
hospital
what is she
205 or
something
which is
like oh
and it's
given so
exhaustively
and she's
you know
often quoted
in these
stories as
kind of
telling the
doctors who
are saying
sorry your
kidneys don't
work and your
lungs don't
work and your
heart's broken
and your blood
isn't good
you know
not sure
the blinking
mechanism will
continue to
function tomorrow
and she's
kind of like
I've got an
ordination
I've got to
get back
to you know
she's got
work to do
she's got
life to give
she's not
seeing the
shortages
she's using
up her whole
lifetime
so here we
are with our
koan
look
the world
is vast
and why
and that's
the first
point
people often
go directly
to
why are you
doing this
why are you
doing that
but there's a
reason that
phrase is
included
as the first
point you
go on
the world
is big
each moment
is complete
instantly
new
changing
there's no
way to see
the end
anything
is possible
the world
the universe
by definition
has no end
your relationship
to it
can't be
defined
in terms of
limit
the world
is vast
unbounded
for us
unbounded
and to
enter the
koan
is in a
sense
to be
pressed
to see
that
wideness
to acknowledge
personally
not as a
theoretical
exercise
but is
that true
as my
grandmother
would say
why would
you say
that
what is
the universe
what is
this world
that's so
vast
where is
it
where is
this
in reality
that he
began
that other
teaching
and in
order
to even
begin
to get
a direct
sense
of that
we're
required
to see
who's
looking
to not
simply
and habitually
fix where
we are
and who
we are
and what
this is
what is
any bit
of it
and if
that's too
cosmic
a question
we tend
to not
really engage
you
is there
a habitual
way
of seeing
understanding
knowing
that
that you
use
to learn
is it
true
what you
usually tell
yourself
in response
to that
is it
in reality
what is
this
daida
she in
his
zen of
seeing
retreats
go off
and take
one of
these
photographs
that's
you know
just
blocks
of color
bits
of texture
light
color
and ask
the participant
to see
it
enter
some part
of it
that they're
drawn to
to feel
what they're
feeling
rather than
look at it
and go
oh
that's an
old
mailbox
leaning
towards the
dirt path
on a
country road
in August
to really
see
and not
know it
in advance
what is a
mailbox
what is
purple
what is
anything
and
to begin
to open
to the
what happens
when we
don't
do that
and it
sometimes
really gets
to me
a lot
of the
ways
that
zen
stories
are
repeated
in
literature
now
enrages
me
and I
just feel
so frustrated
it's like
I want to
take off
my robes
and skulk
away
and never
use the
word zen
again
because
anyone
would bother
with real
spiritual
practice
it's just
another set
of rules
and a
change
of clothing
and some
interesting
stories
and so
you hear
and one
of the
ones that
was so
poignant
was the
pursued
person
enjoying
the woods
rain on
the pine
needles
dropping
just being
in
that space
walking
breathing
crunching
whatever
just
being there
and suddenly
there's danger
there's someone
after her
gang of
God
pursuing
and she
races
looking for
safety
she does
what she can
to fight
she uses
what's around
and it's
clear that
the best
option is
to run
like hell
and she
runs like
hell
until she
comes to
a cliff
edge
and the
only way
to proceed
is to go
down the
cliff
edge
and she's
down there
hanging
from a
bit of
corded
root
without much
strength
left
pursuers
taunting
her
when she
notices
that down
below her
the only
other way
is a
hungry bunch
of animals
tigers
bears
lions
and tigers
and bears
she's the
edible
thing
in the
picture
there's no
escaping
situation
and
and then
usually
the next
line in
the story
we proceed
to rather
delightedly
that she
notices
the message
but where
is that
where is
that situation
where we
know
what the
problem is
what the
options are
and stop
seeing
it's easy
to then get
stuck on
well I got
to find
my strawberry
that's the
message
right
but where
is that
where is
the
when you
go home
for the
holidays
and everything
you think
about yourself
is put
in danger
in someone
your
self
image
is
decimated
and it
doesn't seem
to be
anywhere
what's
the
teaching
where's
the
step
for many
of us
who
have
the
cynical
that's
my
life
what is
it
that
enables
that
as we
hit
January
it's one
of the
things
that
for me
is so
important
to really
look at
those places
that the
end of the
year
has required
hit
some
kind
of a
trap
most
people
and if
you don't
know that
look to
see whether
you're
feeling
vital
if every
day
is the
extraordinary
gift
that you're
so delighted
to just be
if that
feels dead
or muted
or distant
or
impossible
then there's
there's a
connection
with this
teaching
it's imperative
to begin
to take
it in
I recently
was given
a chance
to work
with this
personally
if one
of the
students
in New
York
works in
the United
Nations
for
I always
say her
name
and she's
an international
representative
working on
family planning
in different
ways
through the
United Nations
and he
brought me
this account
of a meeting
she had
with the
Pope
an audience
knowing
that it
would be
of interest
to me
given my
background
and things
that drive
me
and
it
definitely
took me
to a
mood
that
demanded
and continues
to demand
the kind
of practice
that I
wanted to
trap you
into with
me
I'll read
a little
bit about
from the
essay
in which
she met
with the
Pope
as the
conversation
turned to
the free
choices of
individuals
and family
planning
freedom
in this
area
the Pope
declared
there can
be no
individual
rights
and needs
there can
only be
the couple's
rights
and needs
and she
responds
but couples
implies an
equal
relationship
in many
societies
and not
just in
the developing
world
women don't
have equal
status with
men
there's a
lot of
sexual
violence
within the
family
women are
often quite
willing to
practice
natural
methods
and abstain
because they're
the ones
who get
pregnant
and don't
want to
be
but they
can't
abstain
without the
cooperation
of their
partners
she spoke
to him
about the
approximately
200,000
women who
die each
year from
self-induced
abortions
and major
health issues
religious leaders
and all of
us really
must address
this very
important issue
she said
don't you
think
John Paul
II
interjected
that the
irresponsible
behavior of
men is
caused by
women
Sadiq
froze
my jaw
dropped
she reported
afterward
John Paul
II saw
the shock
etched on
the face
of his
interlocutor
and tried
to change
the subject
but the
woman in
the sorry
stopped
him
excuse me
I must
respond to
your statement
about the
behavior of
women
in most
of the
developing
countries
men look
on marital
relations
as their
right
and the
women have
to comply
men come
home drunk
have sexual
relations with
their wives
and the
wives get
pregnant
or they get
HIV without
having any
control over
their partner's
behavior in
their own
situation
Sadiq wasn't
finished
violence within
the family
rape in fact
is very
common in
our society
the most
upsetting
thing about
all this
is that
only women
suffer the
consequences
many women
you know
wind up
abandoned
latin america
is full of
abandoned
families
full of
women who
are left
as the
heads of
households
with children
to look after
while the
men go off
and start
another family
somewhere else
and then she
goes on to
report her
confusion over
seeing his
face look so
stern and his
eyes look so
hard and the
challenge I
realized for me
reading it was
that suddenly
the priest
you know
that I hated
the Pope
every time the
Pope you know
for months
afterwards would
come on
television this
reaction would
come into my
body
there's evil
there's separation
because he's in a
very powerful
position and
consequences of
his position and
understanding
big
and dangerous
in some ways
from my
perspective
and it
it really got
to me after
a while
how strong
that position
is
right
this was
the truth
and I didn't
like the way
it felt
and I had to
become a
conscious practice
for me
to re-enter
that and not
know
this
man
this
human being
just
to be able
to hold
him
in my
awareness
when he
would appear
without
knowing
and to
recognize
again
the consequences
of locking
into a
position
what I
was
responding
to
in a sense
was the
same thing
I was
doing
a position
that seemed
quite locked
also wrong
locked
was having
an impact
on my
life and
lives
that
there was
pain
I care
deeply
about
and it
was very
easy
to get
into that
mode
of
why am I
on the
cliff edge
why is
it like
this
why is
the universe
like this
why is
the situation
like this
which is
very different
from the
question
in this
poem
the question
in this
poem
brings us
back to
I myself
am
not only
the men
she's talking
about
and the women
she's talking
about
but the
poem
as well
as the
women
women
in the
song
so
them
then
what's
the
moment
then
what's
the
moment
a different
openness
opens
that's the
nature
of openness
that's the
nature
of not
knowing
it doesn't
invalidate
what
Kaz Tanahashi
wrote in
the preface
to essential
zen
he said
the message
of pioneers
in the
understanding
of deep
ecology
reminds us
that we
cannot
fully
experience
each
moment
with what's
called
positive
emptiness
unless we
participate
in changing
the social
situations
that are
harming
living beings
and the
environment
in other
words
unless we
enter
intimately
into the
process
into the
work
rather than
stepping back
and judging
and not
and working
with that
then you
also begin
to have
the opportunity
to see
new
possibilities
it's not
locked
it's not
a box
it's just
this
and we
definitely
have the
resources
and the
intelligence
and the
compassion
available
to resolve
the
atrocities
our greediness
and blindness
to one another
we didn't
sense that
we just
all
eat as much
chocolate as
we could
and shoot
ourselves
it's possible
I mean
it's
entirely
imaginable
to me
that we
could
in some
ways
quite easily
resolve
many of
the issues
around this
particular
area
we could
resolve
the issues
of what's
called
teen
pregnancy
in this
country
we would
look at
the whole
picture
of who's
involved
we could
easily
if we
devoted
ourselves
much more
skillfully
and passionately
deal with
issues that
surround
abortion
if there
was an
outpouring
of energy
from those
who wanted
to take
care of
that life
if the
anger was
transformed
into
taking care
child care
centers would
be on every
corner
perhaps
everyone
would be
involved in
parenting
those
children
no one
would be
alone
in their
process
it's not
so hard
to imagine
it's also
possible to
imagine
putting an
end to
prostitution
and all
of those
things
you just
need to
imagine
consequences
and kinds
of responsibility
that a few
of us
have allowed
our minds
to joyfully
devote ourselves
to taking
care of
but it's
not someone
else's
problem
but the
groan
of January
that
heaviness
is often
associated
with the
fact that
we expect
this newness
this freshness
of the moment
to come
to us
they dropped
the ball
the music
played
we hit
the big
bell
do me
and to
really
get
that
December
means
dying
December
means
really
letting
go
of what
was
before
of what
we know
and it's
only through
that
that there's
a new
year
take heed
when one
says
don't
squander
there's no
guarantee
don't wait
till March
you don't
reject
this
move
this
reality
or deny
the challenge
of it
one of the
challenges
of those
who live
at the
monastery
is
the past
couple
of months
have been
very
busy
lots of
people
lots of
events
lots of
required
presence
be
on
be
there
for
have a
quality
of vitality
to give
and
often times
we forget
that
the ease
of real
presence
is to be
willing to
give
what's real
give
don't know
what it's
supposed to
feel
perhaps it
is a
day
of
a
quieter
rainy
energy
not a
sunshine
sparkly
when we
breathe
together
because in
reality
there's
no other
way
fast and
wide
Shibiyama
comments
on
this
poem
by saying
from the
standpoint
of the
world
I myself
am the
world
from the
standpoint
of I
myself
the world
is I
myself
when the
world is
I
myself
there is
no self
when there's
no self
the whole
world is
nothing but
I myself
and this is
the true
no mind
in sin
when one
lives with
this no mind
can there be
anything to
obstruct
oneself
what can
there be
then to
restrict the
world
the world
is vast
and wide
refers to
this no
mind
students
seeking
after the
truth
must first
come home
here
come home
to
no mind
he then
says
master
unman
zen
is really
cutting
and sharp
having
brought you
home
to what's
true
what's
real
he then
asks
so why
do you
put on
your
priest's
robe
at the
sound
of the
bell
if it's
all
just as
it is
there's
nothing to
reject
or deny
nothing lacking
nothing needing
to be
changed
then I
do what
you do
in the
context of
his teaching
there's a
whole bunch
of
shaved
head
monk
guys
around
so that's
what he
asked
I hit a
bell
suddenly you
put your
robe on
why do you
do that
he might as
well have
gone into
the office
downstairs
and said
the phone
rings
you jump
up and
answer
someone says
how do
you do
you say
fine
why do
you say
why when
the bell
rings do
you put
on what
you put
on
it doesn't
mean don't
do it
it doesn't
mean do
it
it doesn't
mean wake
up
when each
and everything
he's
ringing
is the
bell
I watched
last night
Dairoshi
getting ready
for this
trip to
New Zealand
and he
had a
fever
he was
full of
snot
and he
hates
traveling
and he's
not too
hot on
New Zealand
as the
best use
of his
time for
the entire
month of
January
and he's
putting his
robes in
his suitcase
and taking
Benadryl
and getting
ready for
the plane
and there
was a point
which I just
looked at
and thought
why are you
doing this
same
question
why
why would
he
just because
they said
please come
come
there's a
woman on
last night's
news
who has
an old
dog
blue eyed
dog
used to be
a show
dog
and it
I don't know
how it
happened
but it's a
paraplegic
puppy
it's an old
can't walk
dog
can still
bark
got back
the function
of its
tail
she said
so it's
a happy
dog
this old
woman
she must
have been
in her
70s
and she
had this
little green
wagon
that she'd
gotten
fixed up
so she
could take
spot
or whatever
his name
was out
to walk
every day
and somebody
stole the
wagon
and so
they've got
this news
story on
with this
woman
and this
is not a
tiny dog
it's a big
armful of
dog
and she's
like you know
taking this
dog for
his walk
and somebody
noticed
and the
newscasters
came
and said
so you're
walking your
dog
and they're
doing the
happy news
story on
and somebody
sees it
who builds
sports cars
and is
making like
the puppy
car to die
for
for the new
puppy
but the
thing that
got to me
was this
woman's
unstoppability
you know
why would
she do it
why would
she take
this
aeroplegic
dog
on a
walk
Mr.
Mumon
says
now in
studying
Zen and
disciplining
oneself in
Zen
one must
strictly avoid
following
sounds and
clinging to
forms
even though
one may be
enlightened by
hearing a
sound or
have one's
mind clarified
by seeing
a form
or getting
your legs
crunched in
the door
this is just
a matter of
course
it's no big deal
what is freedom
he's saying
it's nothing to
talk about either
if a Zen
person is able
to master
sounds and
control forms
and thus
clearly see the
reality of
everything and
is wonderfully
free in
everything he
or she
does
though it
may be so
you tell
me
does the
sound come
to your
ear or
does your
ear go
to the
sound
what's your
relationship
to this
what is it
subject
object
self
thing
you
me
awake
even if
you're able
to transcend
both sound
and silence
how do you
speak of
that fact
the bell
is ringing
in other
words
what will
you do
if you
listen with
your ear
you can't
truly get
it
when you
hear with
your eye
then
you can
really get
your foot
one master
said
whole body
whole body
what is that
if you
understand it
Muman says
all things
are one
if you
don't
understand it
they're different
and separate
if you
do not
understand it
all things
are one
if you
do
understand it
they're
different
and separate
the first
two lines
is how
we usually
understand
this
mystical
experience
enlightenment
you understand
it
you get
it
you wake
up
then all
things
are one
if you
don't
you're stuck
in separation
duality
distance
but then he
says if you
don't understand
it
all things
are one
if you
do
understand
it
they're
different
they're
separate
so what
do we
do
make
you
have a
thing
have a
book
wrote a
poem
about
being a
woman
in the
black
liberation
movement
and she
was
critiquing
that what it
seemed to
involve was
making large
pots of coffee
for the black
liberation
guys
and at the
end of her
poem
she says
something
about
it finally
hit me
smash her
poem
excuse me
but I
finally realized
that if I was
a natural woman
doing what a
woman did
naturally
I would have
a revolution
take care
of yourself
be
yourself
take care
of the
suffering
of all
sentient
beings
it's not
other than
take care
of yourself
but if that
seems too
large
if the world
seems too
vast
and just
start
the vast
arms
of the
transparent
poem
hymn
hymn
o'
hymn
