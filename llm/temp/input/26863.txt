The Book of Equanimity, Case 50, Shui Feng's What Is It, Preface to the Assembly.
At the last word you finally reach the impenetrable barrier.
Yen Tu is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher
and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother.
Do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions?
Or then again, is there a special operation?
The main case.
When Shui Feng was living in a hut, two monks came to pay respects to him.
Shui Feng, seeing them coming, opened the door, popped out and said,
What is it?
A monk also said, What is it?
Shui Feng lowered his head and went back inside.
Later the monk came to Yen Tu.
Yen Tu asked, Where have you come from?
The monk said, South of the range.
Yen Tu said, Did you ever go see Shui Feng?
The monk said, Yes.
Yen Tu asked, What was said?
The monk recounted the preceding story.
Yen Tu said, What did he say then?
The monk said, He didn't say anything.
He just lowered his head and went back inside.
Yen Tu said, Too bad I didn't tell him the last word before.
If I had told him the last word, no one in the world could affect O Shui Feng.
At the end of the summer, the monk again brought up the story and inquired further about it.
Yen Tu said, Why didn't you ask about it earlier?
The monk said, I didn't dare to.
Take it lightly.
Yen Tu said, Do Shui Feng is born of the same lineage as me.
He doesn't die of the same lineage as me.
If you want to know the last word, just this is it.
The verse.
Cutting, carving, polishing, grinding.
Changing appearances with mixed dialect.
The staff changed into a dragon in Lake Gibi.
The shuttle hibernating in the Tao house.
Born of the same lineage, there are numbers.
Dying of the same lineage, there is no multitude.
The last word, just this is it.
The wind boat, ferrying the moon, floats on the autumn waters.
There's just one full day of the session remaining for us.
Some of you have been struggling with pain that's come up as a result of the sitting.
And it's kind of interesting how that pain, the physical pain, will also trigger lots of other stuff.
And give you really an opportunity to work with the things that come up.
It's hard to keep them suppressed when the pain kind of routes them out.
Pain has a way of bringing the stress points in our life into, up where we can see them.
And in a sense, we can say that practice is a succession of barriers that need to be dealt with.
At first, they're the obvious barriers that we know of.
Then later they become, when you run out, any good training matrix will provide new ones for you.
And in the end, when training is finally finished, formal training is over, it's not that there are no more barriers.
It's just that there's no hindrance.
Muge.
No hindrance.
No hindrance in the mind.
Our tendency is to deal with barriers when they pop up in kind of conditioned ways.
Different people deal with them differently.
The more arrogant among us will get angry and fight.
The more timid among us will have a tendency to withdraw or to run, to move away from them.
Some of us just make ourselves numb.
Others just simply deny it.
As if, in a lot of how we deal with the barriers in practice, it's a lot to do with how we deal with barriers in our life.
And basically, usually, how we have been dealing with them all of our life.
Of course, practice gives us a new way of approaching it.
And that is to immediately and completely merge with the barrier.
Be the barrier.
Instead of running away from it to turn 180 degrees and become the barrier.
So that it ultimately fills the whole universe.
When it does that, and you and the barrier are not separate, 10,000 things have returned to the self.
Where they've always been.
Right from the beginnings.
In this introduction, he talks about the impenetrable barrier.
At the last word, you finally reach the impenetrable barrier.
Yanto is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother.
Do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions or then again, is this a special operation?
It's kind of an interesting little clue to the koan.
The last word, you finally reach the impenetrable barrier.
The impenetrable barrier we also call the killing sword.
Myth has it in Zen circles that the most difficult koan is mu.
That's not the case.
The impenetrable barrier is the most difficult one.
The impenetrable barrier, the killing sword, will come up again and again.
And if you're working with a single teacher, usually very early on in training, it becomes obvious where that sticking point is among miscellaneous koans.
And it's kind of interesting that a student that will stick in a particular kind of koan among the miscellaneous koans,
again and again throughout their koan study, that will keep coming up, and that is, provides the killing sword.
Ganto is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother.
Yento is Ganto, and Shifong is the Chinese pronunciation of Seppo.
There's a story in the history of these two monks, of Ganto and Seppo, and their teacher Toksan,
and some of the skillful means that went on there.
That's what he's alluding to here.
He says, do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions, the fact that he doesn't agree with Seppo, his Dharma brother?
They're both trained as a same master.
Or then again, is this a special operation?
They may be disagreeing, yet as far as I'm concerned, it's all dirt from the same hole.
Toksan lineage.
There are all kinds of special operations.
As I'm training, I've told many of you about
one of the special operations that we used to have at ZCLA
back in the days when I was training there,
at the same time Gimpo was training there,
was we had a special zendo, a separate zendo.
We had the main zendo where most people would go,
and these were people who were
basically studying with Roshi.
And Tetsugen had already emerged as a teacher,
and he would be doing doksan there, too.
And then in the hotbox,
Gimpo would be doing doksan,
or interview.
And I would be working with Gimpo
as the head monk,
kind of the pushing person.
And all the people who were working on Mu
would go to the hotbox,
voluntarily because everybody knew its reputation.
It was a scathing furnace.
We would sit, usually, all night long,
pulsession.
We'd sleep maybe two hours, three hours,
and doksan would go on all night long.
And we'd really push very hard.
The people that wanted to be pushed,
the other ones,
would stay in the other zendo
and do it with Roshi,
and his approach was much gentler.
And basically, my job was,
is when someone was very close,
to squeeze them.
And so the doksan room was outside of the,
I think there were 50 or 60 people sitting there.
The line would form in the next room,
and then there was a flight of stairs
that went up the top of the stairs.
There was a little room,
and that was the doksan room.
And people that were very close,
we would know.
It's obvious when somebody's very,
very close to seeing you.
I would follow them up
into the doksan room,
and I'd wait outside the door for them.
And I'd hear the campos saying,
Oh, deeper!
And he'd ring his bell,
and then they'd come out the door,
and I'd be standing there,
and I'd say,
Did he pass you?
And they'd say,
No.
Get back in there and show him!
But I don't know what to do.
Get back in there!
And I'd throw him back in,
and he'd fall down on the floor,
and Gimpo would look at him and say,
You back again?
What is it?
What is it?
I don't know.
Get out of here!
And ring the bell.
And I would meet him outside,
and back and forth this would go.
And you'd be surprised
how many people broke through.
I mean, it's amazing.
It really amazes me how it worked.
And there was this one guy that was huge.
I mean, this guy could have broken me in half
if he had half a notion to.
And he was just totally freaked out.
He didn't know what to do.
After three or four times,
he was being pushed back into the room.
He finally went in there,
and he started screaming and jumping around
and flopping around.
I could hear him,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
And Gimpo was just sitting there,
and then suddenly it all got very quiet.
And then I heard a little bit of sobbing,
and then I could hear Gimpo testing him.
And he came out of the room,
and he looked at me,
and I looked at him,
and suddenly it all fell into place for him,
what my job was,
what I was doing.
That was him being a bastard.
And he started crying,
and he threw his arms around me.
Now I'm halfway down the stairs,
and he's coming out,
and he's just a big guy,
and he says,
limp as a noodle by this point,
you know,
after being through all of this.
And he throws himself at me,
and the two of us
go down the whole flight of stairs.
And we also,
the Zen Center's very close to Hollywood,
and every once in a while
we get Hollywood stars showing up.
There have been several of them,
well known,
who come to practice there.
And sometimes starlets,
or people on their way to being stars,
and not quite there yet.
And this very, very Hollywood woman,
showed up once,
and inadvertently,
by some mistake,
ended up in a hot box.
It was an awful mistake.
I had no idea.
I figured she knew.
She was dressed really nicely,
wearing a skirt,
and a little makeup,
and jewelry,
and everything.
And suddenly it starts getting frantic,
and frantic.
We would just constantly walk Kiyosaka,
one of us on either side,
and everybody got it,
pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,
down the whole line.
And Doksan was almost constantly.
And this woman ended up
on the Doksan line.
And she was the first one
on the Doksan line.
And all of a sudden,
one of the Teju,
her name was,
this other woman,
who was a real tiger,
was very, very close to seeing it.
All of a sudden,
she took,
Teju leaps out of her seat
in the Zendo,
and comes running into
the Doksan line.
And I saw her come in,
and I knew she was
on the edge of her side.
Put her,
I gestured for her
to come up and sit
close to where I was,
at the head of the line.
So here's this Hollywood lady,
Teju and me.
And Teju's sitting there going,
whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew.
And she was like,
you know, ready.
And the woman kept looking at her
over the side of her eyes.
And all of a sudden,
the bell rings,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
And I didn't want the woman to go.
So I put out my hand like this.
And the woman let out a screech.
She thought I was going to hit her.
Ah!
She fell back.
Teju ran ahead.
Teju passed Mu.
And the woman,
we got transferred
to the other Zendo.
She never came back again anyway.
So that's what I would call
a special operation.
There was also another
special operation.
One day,
I was,
I was,
the monitor,
the head monk
in the Zendo.
And there was
a woman who was
very, very close.
And I was just doing
my usual,
I don't do it
here very much anymore,
but my usual yelling
and pushing
and probing.
And this woman got,
was getting very,
very angry with me.
So she went in
and complained to Roshi.
She said,
you know,
the guy knows out there
and he's always,
you know,
running around with a kiyosaku
and he's always yelling
and carrying on
and particularly
me,
he's saying,
you know,
go deeper,
go deeper,
and stuff like that.
And he said,
well,
you know,
that's the way he is,
very aggressive.
He says,
tell the,
tell the Jisha
to send him into me
when,
when you go out.
So she goes out there.
She says to the Jisha,
he wants to see Daito.
So Jisha calls me
and I go in to Roshi
and Roshi says,
squeeze her head.
There we went,
you know,
back and forth.
He was a kindly old mother
and I was the awful father
pushing.
She too broke through
that session.
The head squeezing
is part of the whole thing.
It's part of testing the waters.
That's what this koan is about.
You know,
when you go into
a graduate school,
you don't just walk
into graduate school
and say,
oh,
I'd like to study
nuclear physics.
They want to know,
you know,
have you done
the undergraduate work?
Have you had the courses
in math and chemistry
and physics?
Did you get your
bachelor's degree?
Did you get your
master's degree?
Where did you get it?
What were your marks?
There are records
that show all of that stuff.
When you want to
get a license to practice,
you know,
a license to practice medicine,
a license to practice law,
a license to practice plumbing
or electricity
or engineering,
everything,
it seems,
except psychology.
You don't need a license
to practice psychology
in New York State.
You have to take a test.
You have to prove
you know what you're
talking about.
You have to prove
that you've mastered
the field that you're
representing yourself
to the public.
when you enter training
or when you enter a monastery,
it's the probing goal.
We need to know
where to begin the training.
I mean,
there are ten stages.
How do you determine
where a student is?
There are snakes
and there are dragons.
There are snakes
that are wearing dragon masks
and there are dragons
that are wearing snake masks.
There's even cases of that
where someone is coming
who is really very clear
and pretending not to be clear
and just to test the teacher.
So that happens too.
It's rare,
but it happens.
And hundreds,
hundreds of the cases,
probably a good 20% of them,
25% of them,
of the 700 koans
that we work with,
have to do
with that testing
and probing.
You remember Toksan,
who was Seppo's teacher.
Toksan and the old woman.
He was the expert
on the Diamond Sutra.
And the old woman said,
says in the Diamond Sutra
that past mind can't be grasped,
present mind can't be grasped,
and future mind can't be grasped.
If you can answer a question for me,
I'll let you have the tea for nothing.
He said, okay.
And she said,
with which mind
would you drink the tea?
If it can't be grasped,
what mind would you use
to have the tea?
He couldn't answer.
She was clear
on where he was at.
He then became clear
on where he was at.
And he began studying
with Ryutan.
When he went to visit Ryutan,
he came in like a dragon.
In fact,
he said to him
something to the effect
that this is a dragging gate.
It was named Ryutan,
but I don't even see a dragon.
And Ryutan kind of was,
you know,
okay,
come on in,
have a seat.
And sat with him
and talked with him
all night.
They discussed the Diamond Sutra.
Real dialogue went on,
you know,
not what you would think
a Zen teacher would do.
And then as he was leaving,
you know,
here's this teacher
all along
having this intellectual discussion
on,
you know,
the nature of,
the absolute,
of impermanence,
the transient nature
of all things.
He goes to step outside
and he sees it's dark.
And he comes back
and he says,
Ryutan,
it's dark outside.
Ryutan hands him a candle.
He takes the candle,
steps out into the darkness,
and Ryutan blows it out.
There was a sudden change
in his style of teaching.
He was no longer explaining.
He was directly revealing.
Once he knew
where he was at
and how he found out
where he was at
is through that whole dialogue.
So sometimes
it happens that way.
Monk comes and says to Joshua,
I'm new in this temple.
Please teach me.
Joshua says,
have you eaten yet?
The monk says,
yes.
Joshua says,
wash your bowls.
Right there
was a testing
and a teaching.
Usually they go together,
too.
Tozan comes to see,
Uman comes to see Tozan.
Not Tozan Ryokan,
yet another Tozan.
And Tozan says,
where are you from?
He says,
from the north.
Where did you spend
the last training period?
Oh, it's such and such
a monastery.
Where were you
the past month?
So and so.
And Tozan says,
30 blows of my stick.
Totally disapproved of him.
Why?
Each one of his questions
revealed where he was at,
where he was lost.
And later he ends up
realizing himself
under Tozan.
So a similar thing
is going on here,
that testing.
When Sheifeng was living
in a hut,
two monks came
to pay respects to him.
This is after his enlightenment.
Sometimes I have to tell you
that story of his enlightenment.
It's really a nice one.
He studied for a long time,
Sheifeng.
He studied
20 years,
probably,
with Tozan.
and
was in his 50s
when he realized himself
with the help of Ganto.
And Ganto really
brought him to realization.
So,
you know,
in this commentary
here,
Bansho
says,
Ungan
consulted
Dao Wu.
Seppo
consulted
Ganto.
A superior person
is not ashamed
to ask humbly.
Now the ways
of Ungan
and Seppo
are flourishing
greatly.
This too
is the superabundant
blessing
of withdrawing
oneself
and deferring
to others.
Superior person
is not ashamed
to ask
humbly.
So in Roshi.
was an acknowledged
Rinzai master,
head of
Riyotaku-ji,
his temple.
And he went
to study
with Harada Roshi,
who was a Soto master.
Harada Roshi,
who was a Soto master,
had gone to
a Rinzai master
to study
after he had
received the transmission.
We find
beginning students
that
are afraid
to ask.
there's nothing
wrong with asking.
But somehow
we feel that
it makes us
inferior.
And actually,
from the point
of view of practice,
that's the superior
person,
the one that will ask.
The inferior one
is the one
that will hide
in their own ignorance.
He says,
also,
Ganto was extraordinary
by nature,
putting down
and upholding
Dushan's way.
He went freely
under heaven
with no one
daring to face him
head on.
It's because
his insight
was clear
and comprehensive
and his development
complete
that he could be
like this.
And to me,
that's the
most critical
aspect of what
needs to take
place here.
what needs
to take
place,
what is
taking place
here.
And I
appreciate
the people
that come
here.
I mean,
Tetsugan,
in nine years
of teaching,
has already
two Dharma
successors.
and my
Dharma brother
Gampo,
teaching maybe
six years
in this monastery,
I think it's
two years old,
three years old,
also has a
Dharma successor,
just about
finished with
a Dharma successor.
And here,
we don't have one
yet,
11 years.
Do I have
retarded students
or maybe I'm
retarded?
And the fact
is that I
really wanted
to be
comprehensive,
clear,
insightful,
complete,
as much as
possible.
Because
there's so
much that's
already going
on in the
West that's
not clear,
comprehensive,
insightful,
and complete.
I've taken it
as my
responsibility
to train
the people
that study
with me
better than
I've been
trained,
to demand
more from
them,
than was
demanded of
me.
And my
teacher's
pretty demanding.
Roshi's no
slouch when
it comes to
training
successors.
But I
feel that
this country
needs,
the West
needs,
that kind
of strong
roots in
order for
the Dharma
to succeed.
So,
it may take
a little
longer here,
but when
it's finished,
it'll be
just like
the description
of Ganto,
putting down,
holding up
this way,
freely,
under heaven.
That's the
way it's
supposed to
be.
That's what
kept it so
vigorous in
the Tang
dynasty.
That's why
it survived
for 2,500
years.
But it
means a
lot of
work and
a lot of
practice.
Of course,
the biggest
part of that
practice is
Zazen,
but Zazen
alone is
not going
to do
it.
Dogen
notwithstanding,
Zazen is
the heart
of it.
You can't
digest the
whole thing
without
Zazen.
Without
Zazen,
it's like
eating a
meal without
the whole
digestive
apparatus,
part of
your body.
It
assimilates
it,
it takes
it,
nourishes
every cell
in your
body.
But with
just Zazen,
you know,
food,
you're
not going
to do
it either.
Just the
digestive
equipment and
nothing to
put into
it,
it doesn't
work.
So they're
both
necessary.
And
digestion,
by its
very nature,
takes time.
In the
way to
really speed
it up.
When you
do,
you get
indigestion,
and it
doesn't
work.
So these
two monks
came to
visit
Seppo.
Seppo,
seeing them
come and
open the
door,
popped out
and said,
what is
it?
And the
two monks
immediately
said,
what is
it?
Seppo dropped
his head,
turned around
and went back
into the
hut.
He didn't
want to
talk to
these guys.
What was
he asking?
What is
it?
How would
you answer?
Confronted
with that
question.
Later,
the monk
ended up
at
Yento's,
Seppo's
Dharma
brother.
Yento
asked,
where have
you come
from?
What's
your
understanding?
The monk
said south
of the
range,
Yento
immediately
knew who
he was
dealing
with.
But he
was nice.
He persisted.
He wasn't
like Seppo.
Seppo just
turned and
walked away.
Did you
ever go
and see
Seppo?
Monk
said,
yes.
Did you
see
Seppo?
Did you
see
Seppo's
teaching?
Monk
says,
yes.
What was
said?
The monk
tells the
story.
Instead of
revealing
Seppo's
teaching,
he tells
the story.
Of course,
he didn't
get the
teaching.
That's why
he had
nothing to
show.
What did
he say?
Kanto
asks.
The monk
said he
didn't say
anything.
He just
lowered his
head and
went inside.
That's a
lie.
It's a
lie that
he
mistaken.
Seppo's
lowering his
head and
returning to
his hut.
He's not
saying anything.
The monk
was deaf.
That's why
he didn't
hear it.
The monk
was blind.
That's why
he didn't
see it.
Kanto
said,
too bad.
Too bad
I didn't
tell him
the last
word before.
If I
told him
the last
word,
no one
in the
world
could
affect
seppo.
Of course,
the last
word
got to
do with
when
seppo and
Ganto
were studying
with
Toksan.
I think I
told the
story yesterday,
didn't I?
Ganto
told everybody
that Toksan,
the teacher of
the monastery,
didn't know the
last word of
Zen.
That also
was a special
operation for
the benefit of
seppo.
so the
monk
didn't say
anything.
The whole
summer training
period passes
by.
Three months
later,
he finally
comes back
to Ganto
and he
says,
you know,
I'd like to
ask about that
dialogue we
had earlier
in the summer.
So Ganto
says,
why didn't
you ask
before?
The monk
says,
well,
I didn't
want to
take it
too easily.
I didn't
want to
take it
too lightly.
Ganto
says,
though
seppo
was born
of the
same
lineage
as me,
he doesn't
die of
the same
lineage
as me.
If you
want to
know the
last word,
just this
is it.
Born
of the
same
lineage,
yet not
dying of
the same
lineage.
Bancho
says,
look at
the two
monks
at seppo's
door,
how their
arrow points
meet.
How are the
arrow points
meeting?
Arrow points
meeting means
absolute and
relative,
merging
perfectly.
Two
arrows
meeting in
midair.
Where was
the meeting
of arrow
points of
these two
monks at
the door?
Now,
this con
comes up
in a
blue cliff
record,
and the
blue cliff
record deals
with it
slightly
differently.
So,
since the
arrow points
meet,
why did he
have doubts
about the
last word?
So,
Ganto
explains to
him,
seppo and
I are
born of
the same
lineage,
but we
don't die
of the
same
lineage.
Though
there is
one reality,
and in
that one
reality there
are no
differences,
the point
of view of
these three
people,
seppo,
Ganto,
monk,
totally
different.
So,
did the
monk not
understand?
Did he
really not
understand?
Issan
said,
even the
great seppo
and ganto
have been
exposed by
this monk,
why would
Issan
say such
a thing?
How did
the monk
expose
them?
Ganto
and seppo
were two
of the
greatest
masters
of that
period.
This
monk
is
unknown.
Why
did
Issan,
another
great
master,
say that
the monk
exposed
the two
of them?
Bansho
says,
I say,
an
impartial
view
doesn't
preclude
the
possibility
of
sympathy
for
seppo
and
ganto.
He
feels
sorry
for
them
both.
Why
does he
feel
sorry
for
them
both?
Did
they
do
something
wrong?
Did
they
miss
something?
One
of the
things
that
constantly
goes on
in these
koans
is that
the
imperative
is the
realization
of the
student.
The
minute
there's
a
word,
the
minute
there's
a
question,
the
minute
there's
an
encounter,
the
teacher
is like
a
puppet
trying
desperately
to get
the
student
to
see
it.
That's
the
whole
point.
That's
the
vow
of
each
one
of
these
teachers.
That's
what
their
whole
life
is
about.
And
in
spite
that
that's
what
the
life
is
about,
just
like
it
is
here,
I have
the
same
vow
to
my
teacher
to
transmit,
not
to
let
it
die,
let
the
lineage
continue.
And
it
may
mean
20
years,
30
years
of
teaching
with
the
distinct
possibility
that
there'll
be
nobody
to
transmit
to.
And
that
is a
really
important
fact
of the
Dharma
and
fact
of
life.
That
you
proceed
with
a
whole
body
and
mind
without
any
expectation.
If it
works,
it
works.
If it
doesn't,
it
doesn't.
You
do the
best you
can.
So,
that
holds up
for
teachers
looking to
transmit
and
students
looking to
realize
themselves.
You
proceed
with the
absolute
conviction
that you
are a
Buddha
and you
will
realize
yourself
and
transform
your
life
but
with
no
expectation.
If it
happens,
it happens.
If it
doesn't,
it
doesn't.
There's
nothing
lost.
Either
way is
okay.
It's
hard to
appreciate
that fact.
Either
way is
okay.
You
know what
our
practice
is about
ultimately
is breaking
free of
illusions.
It's
about seeing
the real
person
under
the
illusions.
That's
a process
that
continues
day by
day,
encounter
by encounter,
hour by
hour.
Sometimes
imperceptible,
sometimes
clearly
perceptible.
Either
way,
you keep
going one
step at
a time.
It's to
see the
real person
under the
illusions.
It's not
to replace
a mundane
illusion
with a
new and
better
Zen
illusion.
That's
what these
monks
were doing.
What is
it?
What is
it?
Take off
the dragon
mask.
We say
sometimes
it's a
snake
with a
dragon
mask.
It may
look like
a dragon,
but it's
only a
dragon
mask.
Take
off the
dragon
mask.
And lo
and behold
underneath
the true
dragon.
the game
is over
and life
begins.
It's
almost
kind of
still
silly.
Dragons
wearing
dragon
masks.
So
take it
off.
Take
them all
off.
Take
off the
mundane
masks.
Take
off the
sacred
masks.
Take
off the
holy
masks and
the
profane
masks.
Take
off the
timid
masks.
Take
off the
arrogant
masks,
the
snake
masks,
and the
dragon
masks.
Underneath
it all
is the
real
thing
just
waiting
to be
discovered.
after
me.
