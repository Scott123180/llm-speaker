The Book of Equanimity. Case 68, Kassan's Slashing Sword, Preface to the Assembly. Inside the heartland, the emperor's command, outside the castle walls, the general's order. Sometimes empowered at the gate, sometimes honored in the room, tell me, who is this? That's the main case. A monk asked Kassan, how is it when getting rid of the dust to see Buddha? Kassan said, you should directly slash the sword. If you don't, the fisherman stays in the nest. The monk brought it up to ask Sakiso, how is it when getting rid of the dust to see Buddha? Sakiso said, he has no country, where will you meet him? The monk returned and quoted this to Kassan. Kassan went up in the hall and said to the assembly, in the establishment of method and school, he does not compare to me. In profound talk, entering the principal, I am still a hundred steps behind Sakiso. Sakiso. The verse. The star-brushing sword, the army-washing weather, settling disorder, deferring the merit, who else is it? One morning, the haze of dust clears over the four seas. This koan is one of the hundred koans that are part of the collection called the Book of Serenity or the Book of Equanimity. And in these koan collections, there's usually a preface to the assembly, kind of a pointer or an introduction to the koan that the compiler of the koans is attempting to show what the point of the koan is about. And that's followed by the main case, the basic koan itself. And these koans are all taken from actual encounters between teachers or between a teacher and a student or between students in antiquity. And they're taken up as the subject for study. For study, and when I say study, I mean study in the Zen way, that is to sit with the koan and zazen and to penetrate to the truth of what's being stated. And then usually there's a verse, a poetic expression of the key point of the koan, of the key of what the koan is about. In this particular koan, the people involved are kind of interesting characters in and of themselves. Kasan, I've talked about before. Kasan is a successor of Tokujou, Tokujou. Tokujou is known as the boatman. In fact, when I looked up, of course there are a lot of kasans, and when I saw this kasan and this koan, I didn't remember which one it was, so I looked up the references, and they said he succeeded the boatman. And the boatman is Tokujou. Tokujou and Dogo and Ungan, all three succeeded the same teachers, for those of you that are familiar with these different teachers. They all succeeded Master Yakuzan. And Ungan transmitted to Tozan, and that became the beginning of the Soto School of Zen, which is our lineage here. Dogo was succeeded by Sekiso, one of the characters in this koan. And Kasan succeeded Tokujou, the other character in this koan. And I have spoken about Kasan before, because Dogen Zenji uses him as an example of the transmission of the Dharma from one generation to the next. And we published that account in the Summer and Fall 89 Mountain Record. And in there, Dogen said, Since ancient times, wise ones and sages have lived by the water. When they live by the water, they catch fish, or they catch humans, or they catch the way. These are all traditional water styles. And going further, they must be catching the self, catching the hook, being caught by the hook, and being caught by the way. And then he says, In ancient times, when Tokujou suddenly left Yakuzaan and went to live on the river, he caught the sage of the flower in river. Isn't this catching fish? Isn't this catching humans? Catching water? Is not catching himself? That someone could see Tokujou is because he is Tokujou. Tokujou teaching someone is his meeting himself. So essentially what he's saying here is that the teacher teaching the student is the teacher meeting himself and the student meeting themselves. The teacher transmitting to the student is the student transmitting to the teacher as well as the teacher transmitting to the student. To realize oneself is to verify the realization of all of the past, present, and future. And what happened in this case is Kassan was actually teaching. One day he was teaching the assembly and in the assembly a monk stood up and asked him what's the Dharmakaya? and Kassan said let me find the actual reference so I don't misquote it to you. The chief monk of the monastery he was Kassan was the chief monk of the monastery and one day when he was up on the rostrum a monk said to him what is the Dharmakaya? and Kassan said it has no form. The Dharmakaya is the absolute basis of reality. Then the monk asked what is the Dharma eye? What is the eye of the teaching? And Kassan said it has no crack. So there are no flaws no gaps it's complete it reaches everywhere it's a continuum it's seamless what he meant when he said it has no crack. And on hearing this Dogo who was sitting in the assembly burst out laughing in spite of himself hearing that answer of Kassan so after the talk was over Kassan went down and talked to him and he said why have you laughed? And Dogo said I have a Dharma brother who teaches others in a boat on the Flower Inn River you should go and see him and you're sure to realize it. Now Dogo was from a parallel lineage these people weren't in the same lineage. Dogo and Tokuju who was the boatman were Dharma brothers so rather than teach him himself he sent him to his Dharma brother. So when he arrived at the boatman's place who was it was during the persecution of Buddhism and what Tokuju had done is he left the monastery and went to live along the river and became a boatman ferried people back and forth which is kind of an interesting image you know crossing over to the other side he was ferrying people back and forth to the other side and he was still teaching but not overtly not in the form that you would normally expect the master to be teaching he had succeeded his teacher Yakuza Dogo had succeeded the same teacher Ungan had succeeded the same teacher and all three were teaching in very different ways one was a boatman one was still wandering around and one had established the monastery so when Kassan showed up he said chief monk of an assembly at what temple do you stay and Kassan said I stay at no temple otherwise I wouldn't look like this Tokuju says you say you do not but then what do you look like and Kassan said I am beyond sight hearing and consciousness where did you learn that beyond sight and hearing and the minute he opens his mouth he reveals how he's caught up in the ideas and hasn't yet penetrated the truth why don't you say a word Tokuju said to him and just as Kassan was about to open his mouth Tokuju the boatman leaped on him grabbed his head and threw him in the river and held his head under water and then he held him there for a while and pulled him up and said while he was still gasping he said say a word say a word and just as Kassan was going to open his mouth he stuck him back under the water again and he kept he did this three times and the third time Kassan had an enlightenment experience he realized that which is beyond the words and ideas that describe reality he realized the direct reality itself and he came up he bowed to Tokuju and Tokuju confirmed his understanding so the transmission was complete and Kassan Tokuju said I'm turning over the fishing line to you the fishing line being the symbol of the teaching of the fisherman catching the fish the fish was Kassan the fisherman was the teacher the teacher caught himself the student caught himself the student caught the teacher the teacher caught the student this is complete interpenetration of absolute and relative breaks through the dualities that separate if you have realized that Tokuju says say it quickly tell me quickly words are wondrous and unspeakable if you can see say it while he was still saying that while Tokuju the boatman was still saying that Kassan stuck his fingers in his ear and started walking away from him and Tokuju said quite so quite so and with that it was transmitted to the next generation but before he was finished Tokuju got into his boat and pushed out into the river and waved his oar and he called back and he said Abbot and when Kassan looked back Tokuju raised the oar saying try to tell me I have something more and with that he jumped into the water and disappeared some accounts say he just disappeared then Kassan became the successor in that lineage so this koan has to do with Kassan's teaching as he started his own lineage in the introduction it says inside the heartland the emperor's command outside the castle walls the general's order one of the things that you find in many of these ancient koans is that a lot of language was military it was the common language is the way people expressed things during this particular period there were lots of things going on with imperial degrees and decrees with emperors and generals and so on so that was the language later when during the Song dynasty language was more poetic and that's the way a lot of the teachings were expressed we use the vernacular here in fact western religions even use the military images in many cases you know onward Christian soldiers and so on so inside the heartland the emperor's command outside the castle walls the general's order inside the heartland means the essence the heartland is the essence it's the absolute reality the heart of the whole thing outside the walls is in the world and in the world where there's phenomena where there's activity where there's action that's where the general is but inside in the essence that's where the emperor is or the king what is the king what is the queen that reigns over the whole catastrophe where will you find her what is the emperor what is the general sometimes empowered at the gate sometimes honored in the room again empowered at the gate is realizing it within phenomena honored in the room realizing the essence that is entering the principle entering the absolute basis of reality in the room could be in the doksan room in the world at the gate could be out in the activity of daily life being able to express the truth in the ten thousand things being able to express the absolute basis of reality that's what they're talking about here so that's the introduction and in the main case a monk asks his son how is it when getting rid of the dust to see the Buddha well first of all the thing to find out is what kind of eye does this monk have is he asking a question or is he testing the teacher because either one could be happening depends on where he's where his realization is how is it when getting rid of the dust to see the Buddha Buddha means enlightened one realized one getting rid of the dust means getting past all of the conditioning and getting to the ground of being that underlies it and I mentioned to all of you doing the workshop that all of us are conditioned we're conditioned from birth conditioned by all of the things that we experience we're conditioned by our education we're conditioned by our parents by our peers by our culture that's the program and the way we react to life is exactly out of that program like a computer you push a button and you call up in the computer the menu you push another button and you get all the stuff is that what we are computers you take a computer and hook it up to a robot and you've got a computer that thinks linearly cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha wonderful you can fly planes with computers like that you can build cars with computers like that you can navigate with computers like that steer a ship all kinds of things and that's one aspect of our consciousness but there's another aspect of our consciousness that's direct immediate intuitive it gets to where it's going by quantum leaps not through linear sequential thought one has to do with the left hemisphere of the brain and the other has to do with the right hemisphere of the brain both together make the total person we only learn about half the part that's linear and sequential we need to see the other half and that's what this monk was asking about getting rid of the dust is all of the extra getting rid of the dust dust to see the buddha to see the enlightened one he wanted to know what's it like what's it like when you've gotten rid of the dust and you see the buddha tell me kasan said you should directly slash with the sword if you don't the fisherman stays in the nest slash with the sword that sword is the sword of wisdom the sword of manjushri the sword of wisdom cuts through all delusion cuts through all that's extra the sword of wisdom cuts through everything including buddhism and enlightenment and delusion why is he saying directly swing the sword directly cut with the sword if you don't the fisherman stays in the nest the nest is a comfortable place to hang out you don't catch fish in the nest you gotta get out there where the water is in the fish yard you don't live a life on top of a mountain contemplating your navel what he's saying is you've got to come down off the mountain and manifest in the world otherwise it's of no value and what does he mean you should directly swing the sword that is if the dust clears and the buddha appears kill the buddha otherwise you put another head on top of the one you already have two heads one is the buddha head and the other is your head are they the same or are they different monk didn't understand it so he went to sikiso and he said how is it when getting rid of the dust to see the buddha sikiso said he has no country where would you meet him what buddha is what he's saying what do you call him buddha i say get rid of the dust and you go blind to get rid of the dust and see the buddha is still the dust get rid of it to get rid of the dust and go blind is no eye ear nose tongue body mind no buddha no enlightenment no samsara one teacher here compassionately pointed pointed to activity and phenomena if you meet the buddha kill the buddha the other came from the absolute basis he has no country there's no dwelling place for buddha if it reaches everywhere if it encompasses the whole universe what place will you put it what country will you establish it that is what space could possibly define it where will you meet him the monk returned and quoted this back to Kisan told them what happened with these two people Kisan mounted the high seat and addressed the assembly and what he said is that in the establishment of method and school he does not compare to me referring to Sikiso his dharma cousin in profound talk in entering the principal I'm still a hundred steps behind him that is in teaching within phenomena I'm much better but in teaching in the absolute I'm much further behind him I disagree I say in entering in the principal he's ahead but in method and school he's behind exactly the opposite Sikiso first studied with Isan Isan one day he was working in the rice shack and Isan came in and said gifts from donors shouldn't be thrown away the rice was always donated to the monastery and Sikiso said I'm not throwing it away Isan bent down and picked up a grain of rice off the floor and said you aren't throwing it away where did this come from and Sikiso had no reply then Isan said don't take this one grain lightly hundreds of thousands of grain come from this one grain and Sikiso said then where does this one grain come from Isan laughed and returned to his room and that evening he went up to the high seat and said people there's an insect in the rice where does this one grain come from what is the source of this one grain what is the source of the one what is the source of the absolute basis of reality later Sikiso went and studied with Dogo and then finally succeeded Dogo and you may remember last weekend last Sunday I gave a talk where Tozan mounted the high seat and he said at the beginning of the fall and the end of the summer your brothers may go east or west but you must go where there's not an inch of grass for 10,000 miles how can you go in this case grass is phenomenon not an inch of grass absolute Sikiso said going out the gate already it's grass just just to move to take action already it's phenomenon already it's the 10,000 things the monk related this to Tozan who said these are the words of the teacher of 1,500 people he approved of them in other words and later Sikiso did become the teacher of 1,500 people his congregation was huge and they sat without lying down erect tree stumps his students the name of his Zendo was the dead tree hall because of this powerful sitting so the monk asking about getting rid of the dust to see the Buddha and the way that was dealt with is exactly the same as the koan we dealt with last week grass and no grass one side phenomena the other side principle one side absolute the other side relative one side good the other side evil one side cause the other side effect grass no grass buddha no buddha blind the has it has not remember Hogan and the monks he gestured to the window two monks got up and rolled up the blinds identically and he said one has it and one has not or Yakujo and the fox the old man said he does not fall into causation for that he was made to live the life of a fox Yakujo said he does not ignore causation and he freed the man from the fox body falling into causation not falling into causation all these dualities one old master said is there no one with two faces on one die one teacher shows the absolute the other teacher shows relative one teacher enters a principle the other functions in phenomena master says isn't there anyone that knows how to merge these two things is there a way to merge these two things if so how when you see that you see the merging and the functioning of all dualities we're not talking about some kind of theoretical thing here absolute and relative we're talking about life we're talking about all of the dualities that we encounter in life you see it here with the absolute and relative you'll see it with the ten thousand things that's where it counts that's where it's got the function the verse the star brushing sword the army washing weather settling disorder deferring the merit who else is it one morning the haze of dust clears over the four seas robes hanging down the imperial rule is naturally effortless star brushing sword just speaks of the far reaching power of that sword of wisdom the sword of wisdom not only kills it also gives life kills is the death of the ego giving life is to be born as the ten thousand things itself that is to realize the ten thousand things themselves army washing weather is a reference to an old legend Chinese about as a general was preparing for war suddenly a great storm came started raining for days and the general said isn't this a disaster to the king and the king says no it's heaven washing the troops this is a reference to the way that same point was turned around in the koan settling disorder deferring the merit who else is it who indeed is it who is it that settles disorder who is it that can go beyond the merit kasan sakiso sakiso sakiso sakiso sakiso the Buddha just to even mention that you should cover up your ears and run away who else is it robes hanging down the imperial rule is effortless this is a reference to the book of changes and a kind of metaphor that's in the book of changes it refers to the effortless rule was in force without command robes hanging down is that image in other words everything just as it is perfect and complete lacking nothing all the grunting and groaning is unnecessary there is no creature on the face of this great earth that fails to cover the ground upon which they stand that's why when you meet the Buddha kill the Buddha the diamond sword kills the Buddhas and ancestors cuts the vines and entanglements and breaks up all the nests one master said the subtle essence fundamentally has no location throughout the body where else is the source of its traces i ask who is it that's asking it's because of inequity that the sword is drawn from its precious scabbard the teacher says because of inequity no balance the Buddha way is the middle way and we've got all this extra attached to it we fall into one side or the other good bad heaven earth up down samsara enlightenment cut away the extra that's what the sword is for seeing the Buddha is extra don't see Buddha see yourself it's to treat disease that medicine has taken from the golden jar disease the loss of ease we need medicine to restore it to that point of balance but we should appreciate the fact that the extra that the sword is cutting and the sword cut each other when you get through using that sword to cut away the extra you still got the sword they need to cut each other they need to dissolve each other they need to both disappear extra and the sword the same with medicine and sickness medicine and sickness must of necessity heal each other where do you find the self that's what makes the difference in how you understand medicine and sickness heal each other the sword and the extra cut each other where do you find the self if you say nowhere then I ask you who then is answering who is it that says nowhere what is it that feels what is it that thinks what is it that lives keep in mind that the truth that has been transmitted mind to mind generation to generation for 2,500 years cannot be found in either of those extremes neither self nor not a self and what is the truth can you show me can you live it that's the great matter of the buddhas and ancestors everything else is extra everything else is part of the process for seeing and realizing that truth for oneself see it and you make it it
