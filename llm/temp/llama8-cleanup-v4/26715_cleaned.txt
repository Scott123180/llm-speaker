Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:

The great way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, in heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinions for or against anything. To set up what you like against what you dislike is the disease of the mind.

When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail. If any of you were expecting Dido here today, you're not alone. I think there was some karma in him talking about the vomiting dwarf yesterday because he's got the disease but bad and is, for the first time in ten years, knocked down in the middle of a session. It occurred to me it was a little bit like Vimalakirti being sick because all sentient beings are sick, but I think Dido's sick because he's been in the interview room with the whole sangha this week. And it sounds like most of us are sick, so it got him.

Since I wasn't expecting to give a talk, I thought I'd give a talk on expectation and come from the heart of where I was. I thought it was, in a way, a wonderful opportunity, in a way, a wonderful opportunity to look at expectation because of also what Dido she alluded to yesterday as a kind of sangha phenomena that we tend to have a lot of expectations about what the teacher should do, what the practice should look like, students feeling like they're not getting their money's worth if there's not interview every time they're here. And his working with that in himself and with the sangha.

And I thought we should do some of that work on our own together. So I thought we could look at expectation in terms of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the sangha. Buddha, as everyone's heard, means the one that wakes up, the enlightened one. It also, in Zen, is used to refer to the teacher, the one who is the manifested form of the one that wakes up. And, by extension, ourselves, the kind of embodiment of the one that wakes up, the person. And practice, in a sense, is to realize that person as oneself, to realize the teacher as oneself, the Buddha as oneself.

So what do we expect of the Buddha, of the teacher? It occurred to me that usually the questions and expectations around this area are kind of indirect. They're kind of questions underneath questions. One of the most popular ones around here is, Why does Dido smoke? And what's implied in that, if you look at it, is a question underneath. You know, is he free? Or is he bound? And if he's bound, then does this training work? And, does this training work means, will it work for me? Will I be able to get free doing this? Does, why does Dido smoke?

This weekend, last weekend at the Zen training weekend, a woman who was just the first time encountering Zen, but a really kind of hot mind, really asking, at the group discussion period said, how come, you know, they say that Zen has kind of penetrated the culture of Japan? You know, that the Zen way is so coupled with the Japanese way that they're almost indistinguishable. And yet, to my eye, she says, you know, Japanese culture has a lot of problems, a lot of serious problems with competitiveness and aggression. And she had this whole laundry list of how bad the Japanese were. Excuse me.

And if Zen is there, then why is that there? Or in other words, you know, does it work? If I do this, will I end up competitive, aggressive, and screwed up, or will I be free? You know, I don't want to, before I put my 20 years in, 30 years in, I want to know what the outcome's going to be. It's been there for a long time. I don't like what I see.

And it really struck me when she was talking. It felt like a very familiar kind of asking in my life because that's the way I encountered Christianity with that looking at it and saying, you know, I don't see anyone whose life I would want to completely identify with. And it's, you know, it's a teaching, very, you know, chauvinistic. And how can they base a tradition on that kind of love and exclude half the human race? Obviously there's something wrong with this tradition.

And it was a revolution to me that when this woman asked the question at the workshop, suddenly I was vehemently responding to her that there's no tradition. You know, there's nothing that says because you put on a raksu that you're a Buddhist, because you live in a Zen culture that you practice, that it is rare. It's probably rare throughout time that people actually do what they say in religious practice. So who knows what could be if a whole culture did Zazen every day, looked at their lives, looked at how they moved and intermingled one among each other.

I think that's our opportunity here as a Sangha to explore that. But I wanted to point it out just to look at how the questions get asked and what we expect from Buddhism and Zen and from that one. In a sense, a lot of the koan questions are expectations. You know, if all things are one, then why are there special things we do? Special robes, special places, special practices. Why do we have to do anything if everything is one?

It's the same question as who am I? What should I do with my life? If it's perfect, if that's what I'm being told and taught, then what do I do? What do I express? In Zen, as you all know, especially after this week, those questions always get bounced right back. If all things are one, why do we have to practice? Sit still. Look to yourself. Drop the thought. Have no preferences.

It seems like they emerge constantly. The moment we notice it, we've separated from it. The moment we notice the teacher, the practice, life, the raindrops, that distance has appeared. And suddenly, with that distance, comes like and dislike and all the problems that pursue from that. When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.

Daito, she talks about intimate practice a lot. It's kind of the key word, in a sense, of his teaching, intimate. Be intimate with yourself, with your life, with your barriers. And still, you know, we hear it, and we still look outside. You know, we make this commitment to be students. And we enter kind of a honeymoon period where we like Daito. You know, he's a nice guy. He's funny. And he's a wonderful speaker. And he's a compassionate teacher. And he's got a lot to give in a certain way.

And then the honeymoon one day is over. And he does something that strikes us as unfair, either with us or with someone else. Usually it's with someone else. He treated them wrongly. And we get defensive and begin looking at it in a very distant kind of way. And in a sense, that's necessary. You know, the honeymoon shouldn't last forever. Or the relationship never grows up. In a way, you have to leave home before you can come home.

And it goes through all sorts of kind of rangy times for most of us. It can be over any issue. Usually it's some issue that we have difficulty with. For me, it was anger. However, I considered Daito, she a very angry man. And his way of expressing himself as just kind of over that line a lot. And it took a long time to begin to not just say the good student things. Well, this is obviously part of the teaching and he's really working on this. But to be able to feel it as what it was.

So we move slowly, I think, into a more mature, real commitment. Where it continues to get tested. You know, in a sense, the expectations help us. Because they express our faith in a way that something can happen. It's possible. Like Shugan said this morning. Many have gone before us. And they've used this way. They've accomplished themselves. It's possible. That's the faith mind. It's possible. Like the third noble truth. It's possible to put an end to suffering.

Actual people have realized their lives. And then there's the doubt that begins to clarify that faith. It, I think, passes us by sometimes that that's necessary. That when we don't let those things come up. When we don't acknowledge our questions. That we miss an opportunity to really see what that question is. To see the question underneath the question.

It's also not a stupid kind of devotion in Zen. There's simply a shifting concentration that takes place. You know, when you ask completely and it penetrates every cell in your being it penetrates your karma it's there moment after moment you don't have to hold on to it it's there it's how you lift your hand brush the hair out of your eyes blink your eyes that's it that's letting go you're not holding on to anything anymore that's when the pebble strikes bamboo.

Sangston ends his poem with a beautiful bunch of lines that I'll read and end with. But before I do that I wanted to encourage all of us to look at what we're expecting. Look at what we're expecting from this day from Dido from each other from our lives. You know it's such a subtle thing and it takes such a fine determination to work with it.

There's a very deep sitting happening today in this endo. I don't think I've ever felt it quite so strong. There's a definite possibility for anything to happen. To not expect but to do completely is how a body heals. If you've ever done any healing visualization that's one of the first things you work with is to do it with complete commitment with no expectation of any set result you just do it you just trust the doing it.

The most powerful thing I could probably do is shut up. Which I'll do very shortly because we've each got exactly what our teacher's been telling us we've got for years the power to do what we need to do everything we need to do. He doesn't expect to give us anything. I don't expect to have anything to teach or give any of the people I'm sitting with except my own practice because that's what I received and that's what I receive every moment we sit together.

I hope and I commit the rest of this day the rest of this session to the kind of practice that Daito Sensei this Dharma and this Sangha is all about. That's my vow. One thing all things move among and intermingle without distinction. To live in this realization is to be without anxiety about non-perfection. To live in this faith is the road to non-duality because the non-dual is one with the trusting mind.

Words the way is beyond language for in it there is no yesterday no tomorrow and no today. I I I I I I I I I I I I I
