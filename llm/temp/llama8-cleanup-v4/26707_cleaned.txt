The Book of Equanimity, Case 57, Gonyo's Thing, Preface to the Assembly. Playing with reflections, struggling for the form, you don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection. Raising your voice to stop an echo, you don't know that the voice is the root of the echo. If it's not riding an ox, looking for an ox, then it's using a wedge to remove a wedge. How can you avoid these extremes? The main case.

The Venerable Gonyo asked Joshu, when not a single thing is brought, then what? Joshu said, put it down. Then, Gonyo said, if I don't bring a single thing, what should I put down? Joshu said, then carry it out.

The verse. Not prepared for meticulous action, he loses the first to move. Realizing himself, the coarseness of his mind, he is embarrassed at bumping his head. When the game is ended, the axe handles rotted at his side. Clean and purify the ordinary bones to play with the immortals.

And this koan addresses the business of the baggage and blinders that we carry with us all the time. And how it restricts what we can see and how we can function and what our capacity is. It really addresses the question of how to be free. We fill ourselves with ideas, opinions, positions, or it's with fear, anxiety, greed, or anger. Or after many years of practice, we fill ourselves with understanding, with spirituality, with clarity, with accomplishment. Or we fill ourselves with attachment, or non-attachment, or sacredness, or profaneness. All of these things, all of these things, fill the cup. All of these things make it impossible to be open, to be receptive, to receive, to truly see, hear, taste, touch, feel. They're all based on separation. They're all based on the mind moving, grabbing onto things.

This week and this weekend, we did two workshops. One of the workshops was a hermitage workshop. At the heart of that workshop was sacred space. Well, I ask you, how do you recognize sacred space? What is sacred space? What is profane space? What is sacred inner space? And is inner space and outer space different? If so, how is it different? If not, why not?

We did a workshop also on the mind of movement. I've asked four people who did that workshop. What is the mind of movement? No one was able to answer me. Where is it? What is it? Can you bring it to me? There's a mind of movement. There must be a mind of stillness. What is that? Are they the same or are they different?

It's very easy to get caught up in all of the ideas that describe practice and to miss in the process the practice itself. We're always busily accomplishing something, chasing something. And while we're doing that, while we fill ourselves with our preoccupations and expectations, we miss the place upon which we stand. And yet there's not a one of us that ever fails to fill that space completely.

In the introduction, this is playing with reflections, struggling for form. You don't recognize that the form is the source of the reflection. By preoccupying ourselves with the ideas that describe reality, we miss the reality. The ideas of the reflection of that reality. The ideas of the words and concepts that we use to describe that. But what's the reality itself? It's easy to draw pictures. It's easy to talk about it. But unless you see for yourself personally what it is, it doesn't impart any strength.

Raising your voice to stop an echo, you don't know the voice is the root of the echo. It doesn't matter what we attach to. The result is the same. Whether you're attaching to a Mercedes or to Buddhism or to enlightenment, the delusion is just as deep. And the delusion doesn't have to do with Mercedes being profane and enlightenment being sacred. Neither of them are profane or sacred. It's got to do with attachment. It's got to do with holding on.

In order to hold on, you need a holder. And the thing that the holder is holding, that's two. The reality realized and actualized by all of the Buddhas and sages and enlightened ones is not two. So the question is how do you transcend that duality of this and that, self and other, of sacred and profane, of mind and no mind, how can you avoid these extremes?

The venerable Gonyo asked Joshu, when not a single thing is brought, then what? Joshu said, put it down. What's he talking about? If there's not a single thing, what is there to put down? Another monk once asked, Master Hoji, when feelings arise, wisdom is blocked. When characteristics change, the body differs. How is it when feelings haven't arisen? The master said, blocked. The monk said, if feelings haven't arisen, what can they block?

This is exactly the same question that this question is in this coin. The master commenting on this said, brash fellows are much the same. Joshu said to him, then put it, then carry it out. You can't put it down, carry it out, carry it with you. Gonyo said, if I don't bring a single thing, what should I put down? If I have nothing, what is there to get rid of? I have nothing is something. It's a big something. It's what we call the sickness of having no sickness whatsoever.

The master wrote a verse on this coin. He said, not bringing a single thing, both shoulders can't bear it up. That's how big it is, not a single thing. It's so heavy, he can barely carry it. At the words, he suddenly knows his error. In his heart, his boundless joy. Since from poisonous ill, he forgot what was on his mind. Snakes and tigers have been his intimates. Empty and still for a thousand years, the pure breeze still hasn't stopped.

Somehow, when we talk about things, and it's the basic method of communication that we have, it doesn't get through. It doesn't seem to register. I mean, we say again and again and again. Every one of these koans is presenting the truth. Every talk, every sutra, every verse is constantly pointing to it. And nobody sees it.

In this koan itself, Ganyo, when Joshua said, then carry it out, Ganyo was enlightened. All of you are hearing the same thing. So we should have a mass kensho. Why doesn't it happen? Why is it that sometimes the words connect and other times they don't connect?

In that building of the hermitage. Where was the teaching? I have a student that's been practicing here for about six years. That's what she asks me every time she comes to Doksan. She describes some event that happened and then she says, where was the teaching? Where is the teaching? Sometimes it's hard to see.

There's a classic story of, I forget who it is, either Milarepa or Naropa, one or two or the other or both of them maybe. One was the master, one was the disciple. The disciple was a great builder, a carpenter, an expert, a professional. Those are the most difficult to deal with, experts and professionals. And particularly when you're dealing with them in your own field of expertise and professionalism.

It's as if the door will close, there's nothing else to learn and definitely nothing to learn from someone who is not a fellow, professional, or expert in that field. And so, such was the case in this disciple who came to the master and said, please teach me. The master said, you're a builder, aren't you? He said, yes. He said, then please build me a house. Build a large house, four stories high and so many feet wide and so many feet deep and he described how he wanted it and he said, and I want it here.

So, the builder set to work on it. If he would build this house, he would receive the teachings. He worked on it for three years and finally it was complete. He told the master, here it is, just like you asked. What are the teachings? The master said, I didn't tell you to build it there. I said, build it over there. So, take it down and build it over there and he took it down and you rebuilt it over there.

Three years later when it was complete, he came back and said, the house is finished. Where are the teachings? He said, that's not where I said to build it. I wanted it over there. Take it down and move it. Build it over there. Down came the house, up it went and the next place. Halfway through it he realized himself. He realized the teachings. He understood what was going on.

So, what is it that's going on in the building? Where is the teaching? Is it the finished building? Is it the sacred place? Is it the design? The discussions? What is the teaching in Zazen? You just sit there doing nothing. Where is the teachings in the service, in the chanting, in the bowing? Where is the teachings in the work? If you wait for someone to give it to you, you waste your time. It can't be given. If you wait to receive it from someone or somewhere, you waste your time. It can't be received.

Ten thousand Buddhas couldn't give it to you. Not a single one of them has ever received it. Then what is this marvelous teaching that can't be given and can't be received? I remember a very similar thing happening to me when I went to study with Minor White. Minor White was a professor of photography at MIT. He was also known as the Eastern Guru of photography because of his unusual ways of teaching.

I had admired his photography and I had admired his work for many, many years and finally an opportunity came to go and study with him for ten days of intensive study. How intensive I hadn't even dreamed of. And I had a very large sum of money which took a long time to gather. And finally I got to the workshop and immediately first day four o'clock in the morning were all out in the field 60 of us dancing. The teacher that I'd spent a thousand dollars to study with was dancing in the line with us.

There was a strange woman up in front of us showing us how to move. And then after we danced we did meditation. Then we did yoga. Then I had to be a camera while someone led me around with my eyes closed. Then I had to dance with a tree. Four days. I never touched my camera. We didn't take a picture. Where is the teaching? I asked. And the old man smiled.

And before that ten days was finished my whole life. was turned upside down. He had opened my eyes by ripping the eyelids off. I went there filled with expectation on what a photography teacher has to do. What does it mean to study photography? What does it mean to know the difference between looking and seeing? Filled with all of those expectations and ideas there was no room for anything else.

That kind of blindness prevents us from hearing seeing receiving touching tasting. When not a single thing is brought then what? This monk Gonyo was convinced he didn't have a single thing. just that idea itself is a burden that's totally unbearable. It just crushes you into the earth, smothers you, covers you, blinds you, deafens you, numbs you.

That's why Joshua said put it down. If I don't bring the single thing, what should I put down? Someone that's not carrying a single thing doesn't ask that kind of question. He persisted in believing that he didn't have a single thing. So Joshua said, then carry it out. There's nothing you can do with someone like this. completely closed, completely full.

One of the things that we run into all the time is not having a question. Eakin Roshi talks about it in his book Taking the Path of Zen. He describes it in terms of when he was a school teacher. He said, when he was a school teacher, the student that threw a piece of chalk at him when his back was turned, he was able to do something with. There was a possibility for communication.

But the one that did nothing was hopeless. There was nothing that could be done. So many people don't have a question. if if when everyone else panics you remain calm perhaps you don't understand the problem. So is that possibility. Without a question a person is either dull, dim witted, or a dead horse.

Buddha talked about the four kinds of horses. A horse that moves at the shadow of a whip. The horse that only moves when the whip touches its skin. The horse that only moves when the whip cuts its skin. And he always compared that to a kind of student. One that moves at the shadow of the whip. You don't even need to say anything. It knows and it goes.

He never mentioned the dead horse. The dead horse is my own classification. There's nothing you can do with a dead horse except a nice memorial service perhaps. Bury it before it stinks. So either of those three things usually smothers any kind of question. But also some people are forgetful. That is their mind keeps bouncing from thing to thing.

So the question never materializes itself. It never crystallizes into something. Or they have a full house that is a full deck or a full cup. There's no room for any questions. Or sometimes they're frightened. That's very similar to forgetful. That creates a lot of scattered energy and it's hard to bring it all to a point.

And there's always the possibility that the person is enlightened. Someone who has realized themselves, someone who is clear that rhinoceros horn of doubt is completely shattered. It's always very easy to tell these different types apart. So we reveal it every time. With every movement we reveal it. With every word that we say we reveal it. With every breath we take we reveal it.

The last line says, clean and purify the ordinary bones to play with the immortals. And what he's saying is that each one of us, just as we are, just as we are, contains all of the clarity, all of the possibilities of the sages, the wise ones, the enlightened ones, but it's buried.

We can't see it, we can't feel it, in that simple, direct practice of zazen. Just being with the breath, breath after breath, without anything extra, just watching the flow of your thoughts, without any outside help, within that is the power to take the darkness out of the night. Within that is the power to see beyond the light of day.

Then you will realize for yourself that the truth, that the way, has nothing to do with either lightness or darkness, either absoluteness or relativeness, neither sacredness or profaneness, moving mind, still mind, heavenly mind, earthly mind. The ordinary bones are the bones of the immortals. The ordinary bones, your bones and my bones, are the bones of the sages and wise ones.

It's just that it's so hard to see it because of all that activity, because of all of that conditioning, because of all the things we hold on to. It's truly nothing special what we're speaking of. It's truly the ordinary life of each one of us, easy to talk about, very difficult to see.

I only wish is that you take back from this week of study or this weekend of study, just a little bit of that zazen, bring it into your life, start each day with it, end each day with it, ten minutes, just that much time out of your day, give it an opportunity to work, but really do it. Don't just sit there, engage it, work with it, be the breath, breath after breath, forget the self.

When you forget the self, there's nothing to hang on to, there's no one to do the hanging, empty and still for a thousand years, the pure breeze still hasn't stopped. That pure breeze is the life of each one of us, present every day, every moment, from before we were born, to continue long after we're born. it's only a matter of seeing it for yourself. Thank you.
