The Gateless Gate Murillo Soju's Poems on Oryo's Three Barriers

The Three Barriers is a koan that Master Oryo always used in questioning his disciples. Master Murillo Soju made a poem on each one of these three barriers and added one of his own at the end, offering these poems as a way of thanking Master Mumon, who had been kind enough to come and give tesho on the 48 koans.

Master Murillo

Why is my hand like Buddha's hand? I could feel the pillow at my back, and involuntarily I gave a great laugh. In truth, the whole body is the hand.

Why is my leg like a donkey's leg? Even before taking a step I have already arrived. Freely I pass over the four seas just as I wish. I ride backward on yogi's three-legged donkey.

Everyone has his own cause of birth. Each has realized his antecedent determinant. Nanta broke his bones and returned them to his father. Did the fifth patriarch ever rely on any paternal relation? Buddha's hand, donkey's leg, and the cause of birth. They are neither Buddha, nor Tao, nor Zen. Do not wonder why gateless barriers are so difficult. They have aroused the monk's intense animosity.

Mumon was lately at Zyugan. Settling down in the Zen seat, he criticized koan, old and new. He cut off the ways for both the wise and the ordinary. A number of dragons in hiding may stir up a peal of thunder. Master Mumon has been invited as the leading monk. I thank him with this humble poem.

Late Spring of the Third Year of Jyotai, 1230. Written by Murillo Soju.

Some of you may not be familiar with Mumonkan. Mumonkan is a collection of 48 koans that are part of the koan system that we used here at Doshinji. We start off with a first koan, which can be any one of three or four first koans. Usually it's mu, sometimes it's not. And after completing that first koan, the students then work on 200 miscellaneous koans.

The 200 miscellaneous koans are koans that are used to refine one's understanding of mu, the first koan. And by the completion of that sequence of koans, the students should be in what we call the fourth stage of training, or the fourth ox-herding picture. Should be beginning it. The first stage of training is working with the breath. Second stage of training is working with the koan, mu. Third stage of training is working with the 200.

So in the fourth stage of training, the student begins these 48 koans of Master Mumon. In the fifth stage, we work with the 100 koans of the Blue Cliff Record. In the sixth stage, we work with the 100 koans of the Book of Equanimity. In the seventh stage, we work with the koans of the transmission of the lamp. In the eighth stage, we work with the five ranks of Master Tozan. And in the ninth stage, the koans of the Precepts.

So for the students doing that track of training using koans, it's a very comprehensive overview of both, not only understanding, one's understanding of these koans, but also the historical context. You get a lot of Buddhist history, philosophy, and education in general by working through each of the koans. They total about 700.

The Master Mumon, the name of the collection, we loosely translate as the gateless gate, but it's actually not an accurate translation. Mumon is the name of the author and also the name of the book. Master Mumon. Mu means no, and mon means gate. So, his name, Mumon, meant no gate. And kan means barrier. So, Mumon kan means the no gate barrier, or the barrier that has no gate.

And when you really look at it, that's what this dharma is, the gateless barrier, a barrier with no gate. And the reason it has no gate is because there's no way to enter it. It reaches everywhere. It's like a fish in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean looking for the gate to enter the Atlantic Ocean. He's already in the midst of it. And all of these koans are that reality. We're already in the midst of it.

And the only reason it becomes a koan, and the only reason that everyday life koans become koans, is because we've put ourselves outside of them. And they become a barrier. And that's why we say whatever the barrier is, the only way through it is to be it. When you are the barrier, how can you speak of a barrier? It reaches everywhere. It permeates to ten directions. And it's the same as no barrier at all.

You see, there's no place to stand to look at it. and there's no place to look at it. And there's no place to look at it. Now, Mooman, at the end of the collection of his 48 koans, there are some additional koans that we work with, too. The last of Mooman's koans is Kempos' One Way. And then there's a Mooman's Postscript and Zen Warnings, which we treat as a koan here also.

A student has to deal with that. And following that are these three poems on Orio's Three Barriers and then Amban's 49th talk. And we do each of these as a koan.

Now, to get a sense of how all of this interrelates, these koans are part of the Rinzai school's way of teaching. And of course, our practice here includes both Rinzai and Soto school methods of teaching. And in fact, the deeper you get into Zen, the more you realize that it's kind of ridiculous to talk about Rinzai school and Soto school, particularly in this country.

So those divisions have pretty much dissolved, and particularly here in our practice. Now, Master Rinzai, the Rinzai school was one of the five great schools of Zen in Tang Dynasty. And the only two that survived were the Rinzai school and the Soto school down to the present day. The other three schools have died away.

And then the Rinzai school at one point around, during the Sung Dynasty, in a period of about 1000 AD to 1100 AD, it split into two schools. One school was the Yogi school and the other school was the Oryo school. And the Oryo school was the school that Master Dogen was first transmitted to.

He, after leaving Mount Tendai, went to study at Isai's monastery and completed koan study under Master Myozen there and received the transmission of the Rinzai school. That was the Oryo school. That school later died out in Japan. And actually the only place that that school remains is in the Dogen lineages.

And then the other school, the Yogi school, also was transmitted to Japan. That's the school of Master Hakuin again. And that's the school that survives today in Japan. All of the Rinzai temples of Japan are part of the Yogi school. And the Yogi school later after Master Hakuin again split into two schools.

One is the Takuju and the other is the Ngaku schools. Now in the Takuju school was Harada Roshi and Yastani Roshi which is one part of our lineage that comes to us through Maizumi Roshi. In the Ngaku school is Kori Roshi. which is also part of our lineage.

So we represent basically the teachings as received in three Zen lineages. The two existing Rinzai schools and the Soto school have all come down and are part of the training. Like those 200 koans are 200 koans that are used in the Ngaku school, not in the Takuju school.

Yet the other koans of the Blue Cliff record, for example, are koans that are used in the Takuju school. The school and the koans of the Book of Equanimity and the precepts are used in the Soto school. So by combining all of those it kind of makes a very, very complete training representing all of the major living lineages of Zen.

Now, Master Soju was a contemporary of Master Muman. And evidently he was in charge of a monastery and invited the name of the monastery was Zui Ganji. And this is what Master Soju said.

Recently Master Muman stayed at my temple, Zui Ganji, and settled down in his Zen seat. He criticized old and new without reserve, cut off ways for both saints and ordinary people alike. There was no holding him back.

Now, that position of head monk, basically, is what he was. and in those days head monk was the equivalent of what we call goto today. In a big monastery, the abbot usually doesn't do the teaching. The abbot is basically kind of an administrator and spiritual leader of the community, but not necessarily the teacher.

It's the same in Christian monasteries. The abbot has more of an administrative responsibility. And the teaching in Zen monasteries is usually done by the goto. And usually the goto and the abbot are old teachers of equivalent understanding and experience.

And so Muman was invited by Soju, they were both equivalent contemporaries, to be the head monk and to teach at his monastery. And so in his teaching, these 48 koans came out. What he did is he selected koans that he thought were important for the training of those monks at that time.

And then later someone collected them and published them and it became handed down from generation to generation. And so as a way of appreciating Master Muman, Soju who invited him in the first place, took up these three barriers of Master Uriyo.

Now Uriyo, you remember, is one of the lines of Zen, the one in particular that was transmitted by Isai to Myozen and then to Dogen. So he was a famous master, Master Uriyo. And he would show his hand to the monks and say, Why is my hand like the Buddha's hand?

The first thing we need to not get confused about is such words as Buddha's hand or donkey's leg. The truth needs to be seen immediately without getting caught up in the words. What is Buddha? What is donkey? Again, what can be said about the hand? Can be said about the leg.

When the whole body and mind is the leg. The whole universe is the leg. There's nothing outside of the leg. So even before taking a step, I've already arrived. Just like the fish in the middle of the Atlantic looking for gaining entrance to the water, before he moves, he's arrived.

just like each of us searching for the way, before we move, we've arrived. When the leg fills the whole universe, it's the same as no leg. How can we speak then of taking a step or not taking a step? obviously he can step over the four seas without lifting a leg.

And that last line, I ride backward on yogi's three-legged donkey. Once a monk asked Master Yogi, what is Buddha? A three-legged donkey goes by clattering his hooves, answered Master Yogi. three-legged donkey is another name for the one who has transcended their leg. Or it's another name for the true self, the Buddha nature.

But Soju says that he rides backward on that three-legged donkey. And to ride backwards on that three-legged donkey is obviously someone with a lot of experience in donkey riding. What is it it expresses is absolute freedom. Absolute freedom.

It's based on the true self of no form. No form means it reaches everywhere. No form means it's all form, every form. that the skin bag is not who we are. It's the smallest part of who we are. Now this leg and this hand it's come up many times in different ways.

hand of Oryu, Gutai's finger, Rinzai's fist, Buddha's flower. Are they the same or are they different? See, the Dharmakaya we sometimes think of, the Dharmakaya is the great void. and in fact it is, no form. But it's also the nature of the self, true nature, Buddha nature, the nature of all things.

Here's another poem for you to contemplate. This miraculous hand clutching and letting go. Reaching into heaven it plucks the angel's wings. Penetrating into hell it smothers the inferno. Nothing remains to compare it to. How can it be called Buddha's hand?

And what do you call it? how is this hand like the Buddha's hand? How is this leg like the donkey's leg? How is your body the body of the Buddha? Find out if you don't know. in the very process of that find out you give life to the Buddha. You save all sentient beings.

Not in the goal in the process you give life to the Buddha. And sometimes the deeper our practice goes and the closer we get to the edge of the cliff. The closer the more resistance begins to come up. That resistance takes many, many forms. Going unconscious, getting sick, getting angry.

I don't need this. Thank you, I understand enough. Thank you, but I've got other things to do. All kinds of ways to avoid studying the self. The biggest thing we need is determination, intimacy, faith, faith in yourself. Trusting yourself, knowing you can do it, knowing you will do it, not I'll try, I will do it.

And that determination is each time you go off, you acknowledge it and bring it back. You go off, you bring it back. And working with the breath, or working with the koan, working with mu, be it with the whole body and mind. What that means is to make it physical, tactile, tangible, feel the breath, feel mu, make it mental, hold it in your mind, make it spiritual, experience it with the whole body and mind, make it personal, make it intimate, be the breath, be mu, forget the self.

And most of all, throw away expectations, be ready for anything. We're very fortunate to have the opportunity to practice the Buddha way. been over a million years of human evolution and we look back on our history. Basically, it sucks. It's a history of war, aggression. We're slowly destroying our planet.

We're still locked into the patterns of ego behavior that our primordial ancestors needed in order to survive the environment and the saber-toothed tiger. That same syndrome is still functioning. And the power that that syndrome provided that made us survive is available without the syndrome.

I used to wonder why someone hasn't figured it out. Well, a long time people have figured it out. For 2,500 years people have been practicing it. Hundreds of thousands of men and women have passed through that gateless barrier to freedom, to clarity.

And now here we sit on this mountain face to face with the opportunity of a lifetime. What we do is finally up to each one of us. Our karma brings us to this point. But we still can choose to go forward or to turn and go the other way. Either way is okay. Ultimately, it's your ballgame.

It's not easy to die the great death, the death of the ego. It's the most difficult thing any of us will ever have to do. But when you die once, you can never die again. To realize itself, the self takes one moment in time. It gives us the opportunity to realize for ourselves, for each one of us, that human potential that we're born with.

And that is the ability to live this life to its fullest in peace, in harmony, and alive and vital. That's what life is. Peaceful, harmonious, alive and vital. every day is a good day. When there's no vain thought, the cloud of mine.

But don't believe a single word that I say. Find out for yourself. will continue tomorrow. Thank you.
