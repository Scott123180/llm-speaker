The Gateless Gate Case 47 Tosotsu's Three Barriers

Master Tosotsu made three barriers to test his monks to inquire after truth. Groping your way through the underbrush is for the purpose of seeing into your nature. Hear now, where is your nature, venerable monk? If you realize your own nature, you are certainly free from life and death.

When your eyes are closed, how can you be free from life and death? If you are free from life and death, you know where you will go. When the four elements are decomposed, where do you go?

Master Mumman's commentary: If you can rightly give three turning words here, you will be the master, wherever you may be, and live up to the Dharma, no matter how varied the circumstances. If however, you are unable to give them, I warn you, you'll get tired of food that you have bolted, and well-chewed food keeps hunger away.

Master Mumman's poem: This one instant as it is, is an infinite number of kalpas. An infinite number of kalpas are at the same time. This one instant. If you see into this fact, if you see into this fact, the true self which is seeing has been seen into.

Buddha's own search, his own religious quest, began with the question of life and death. A student's entry into training here at Zen Mountain Monastery is based on the question of life and death. As the students stand in that Gaitan, asking permission to enter, they say, "I come here realizing the question of life and death is a vital matter. I wish to enter training in this monastery." And then they enter.

Each evening at the end of the day's sitting, the Jikido chants the evening gatha: "Let me respectfully remind you, life and death is a vital matter. Time passes swiftly, and opportunity is lost. Each of us should strive to awaken. Awaken, take heed. Do not squander your life."

So clearly, that question of life and death is a fundamental matter that must be addressed by this practice. A question: who are you? Who are you is that first question that Tosotsu asked here now, where is your nature, venerable monk? What is your true nature? What is your original face? That's the same question: is who are you? What is truth? Where do you come from? Where will you go? What is reality? What is life and what is death?

Then, in a sense, that first question here now, where is your true nature, venerable monk, to have resolved that question clearly is to have resolved all three of them clearly. And this koan is one of very famous koans in Rinzai school. It's used as one of the final koans toward the end of training.

The whole point of the person's training is to see their true nature. It's what we call kensho or realization. And at the end of the training, this teacher asks his monk: right now, show me where is this true nature? And if you've seen the true nature, then you are certainly free from life and death.

When you're breathing your last breath, how can you be free of life and death? And if you are free of life and death, then you clearly know where you will go. When the four elements decompose, where do you go? The four elements, and this koan goes back to the year 1000. At that time, they believed that everything was composed of these four elements.

We can say, when all of your cells and atoms and molecules have completely disintegrated, then where are you? Where is your true nature? It's the same question: what is life? What is it that's born? We call life. The unborn in Buddhism, what does that mean? Life is the unborn. What is death? What is it that dies? We say that death is the unextinguished in Buddhism, what does that mean?

There are all kinds of ways religion of necessity must deal with these questions, and different religions deal with them quite differently, particularly quite differently than Buddhism does. In Buddhism, there is no soul. We talked about that several times during this weekend.

What is the self? We say to study the Buddha way is to study the self, and to study the self is to forget the self. And what is the self? Well, for most of us, the self is this skin bag. Everything inside the skin bag is me, and everything outside is the rest of the universe. That's the conclusion we come to very early on in life.

Immediately, everything we need and want and desire is outside, and that separation is the first premise, and everything follows. I mentioned earlier, you ask yourself the question, what is the self? What you come up with is a list of aggregates: my body, my mind, my thoughts, my feelings, my ideas. Those are aggregates.

What's the self? Don't evade the question. What's a room? Walls, ceiling, floor, windows, doors. Those are aggregates. What's roomness itself? Western philosophy says you take the aggregates away, and what you've got is an essence. Essence of a room, essence of a chair, essence of a person. And the essence of a person is a soul. That's the Judeo-Christian way of seeing it, but it's not the Buddhist way of seeing it.

In Buddhism, when you remove the aggregates, what remains is nothing, vast emptiness. And it's because of that emptiness that the ten thousand things exist. We take the self to be who we are, the self is an idea from a Buddhist point of view. That's what's realized, that's what it means to study the self is to forget the self.

And when the self is forgotten, what remains? What happens to you? What is it that's left when there's no longer a self? Everything, the whole phenomenal universe, past, present, and future. It's just that there's no longer an idea that separates you from that.

I ask you again, what is it that's born? What is it that dies? That question has plagued me very, very young, ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old. I was very interested in science, very interested in astronomy and biology, and I wanted to know what is it that's life.

When you look at something that's one moment alive and the next moment dead, everything is still intact, and yet we say it's dead, but we say it's alive. There are miracles, both of them, the miracle of life and the miracle of death.

Those questions led me to finally go into science, and one of my major preoccupations during seventeen years of doing scientific research was about the origin of life. It's kind of interesting that I've always regarded Einstein's theory of relativity as a religious experience, equal to that of any saint or any Buddha. Kind of almost a revelation: E equals MC square. What an extraordinary statement that energy and mass are interconvertible.

There's a dynamic relationship that exists between those two. It's marvelous, still incomplete, but marvelous. You can imagine a universe that's just energy, nothing else. When there's just energy, there's no way to know that we measure energy by its interaction on matter. It's a relativistic thing to know that it's present, but there's just energy, and yet that energy has the potential to manifest itself as mass.

E equals M, mass times the speed of light squared. That's the relationship between the two. So energy can become mass, mass can become energy. It's the whole basis of atomic energy. A small amount of matter, this tremendous force of energy is produced.

If you've got a universe that's just energy, ultimately, you're going to have mass, you're going to have atoms, molecules, proteins. I mean, the minute you create molecules, they have inherent characteristics, they want to couple, they want to form. If the conditions are right, they come together, they come together in very specific ways, there are certain affinities.

So you can see this evolution beginning to take place. The moment you've got energy, you're going to have mass. The moment you have mass, it's inevitable that life has got to happen. Those molecules will arrange themselves. Some beautiful work has been done on that subject many years ago, 30 years ago, showing that if you put together very simple atoms in a reducing atmosphere, that you can produce amino acids by electrical bombardment, like lightning storms.

And here's this huge universe of particles, and the minute those particles appear, they begin to coalesce and attract each other. The closer they come, the more compact they come, the more energy is compacted, and then they burst and explode. And some of these particles flying into the cooler parts of outer space begin to cool down.

They find themselves orbiting around a central mass, the sun. As they cool down, a crust forms on the surface. As that cooling continues, towards the center, condensation vapors of ammonia and so on can form on the surface. And then the clouds part, and light comes, energy, and these atoms and molecules begin to come together, and primitive forms of life happen.

And time evolves, and more and more complex forms of life. And one day, one of them crawls out of the soup up onto dry land, and the evolution continues. Life, what a marvelous gift. Death, what a marvelous gift. We can think of all of this in terms of heaven and hell. We can think of life and death in terms of reincarnation. Hundreds of different ways of doing it.

But from the point of view of Buddhism, from the point of view of Zen, what is the self? I had a teacher that during Zazen used to go up and down the aisles saying, "Die, die." On your pillow, when you die once, you can never die again. I thought he was insane during those days, but I came through the years to understand what he was talking about.

The death of the ego, the death of the idea that encapsulates us in this bag of skin that we call me, I self, ego. If you look at it, just look at it, you know who you are. You're the same bag of skin that you were when you were nine months old. Of course not. You're constantly changing.

You're the same bag of skin now that you'll be when you're 80. Of course not. You're constantly changing. Five years ago, who you were, every molecule, every atom that was there five years ago was no longer in your body. That's even scientifically verifiable.

We're in a constant state of equilibrium with our environment. The same air we breathe today is the air that Buddha was breathing, and Jesus was breathing. We assimilate this great earth. We take into our bodies its nourishment, the water, the minerals, the elements, and we assimilate it. And we also produce a waste that returns to the great earth.

I've told many of you about that little cartoon that we were going to do in LA. In LA, they used to have this evening sermonette, and they always had a minister, a rabbi, or a priest. And we figured the Buddhists should be given a break. There are a lot of Buddhists in LA.

So we went to the radio, to the television station, and said, "You know how about giving us a chance?" And they were going to do it. So we decided we didn't want to add another talking head, you know, that was going to say something very spiritual. Instead, we started working on this cartoon called impermanence.

I wish we had finished it. We had never finished it. It would be a great cartoon, maybe someday. But this cartoon starts with an egg and a sperm in vast space, and suddenly they find each other. These two things, and when they touch, bing, sound and light, and suddenly the reproduction starts.

And this thing becomes more and more complex, and becomes an embryo, becomes a fetus, and then the next thing you know, it's moving. It's moving through time and space. The umbilical cord falls away, and it's crawling along on the ground.

And after a while, it gets up on two feet, and it's kind of wobbly and teetering. And there it goes. And as it walks, the walk becomes stronger, the body becomes stronger, it begins to fill out, and the walk becomes kind of a stride, and the body becomes very beautiful and round.

And it keeps striding through time and space, while this whole thing is going on, there's this huge cornucopia of life that's pouring food, life into one end of this creature that's walking. And in its wake, there's waste that's being deposited. So there's a wake behind it.

I actually calculated it once. It comes out to about 16 tons by the time you're about 40 years old of waste that you've produced. And I often ask the questions: who are you? The 16 tons or the 150 or 80 pounds that you carry around inside the skin bag?

It's an interesting question. But anyway, you continue through time and space, and gradually the process begins to reverse itself. The stride becomes a little slower, a little more steady, and the body becomes a little smaller, and bends over a little bit.

The walk becomes slower, and bending over is a little bit more, and gradually we begin to kind of shrivel up, and walk very, very, very slowly. It's very difficult to walk. And then all of a sudden, bing, it's gone. In permanence.

Who are you? All that cornucopia that came into you? All of that waste that went out of you? All of the different forms of that skin bag as it changed through time and space? None of it, some of it, all of it? Who are you?

What does it mean to see into one's own nature? We talk about the ground of being underneath all of the layers of conditioning. And all of us are conditioned. Conditioned by our parents, and by our teachers, conditioned by our culture, and by our nation, conditioned by our education, and by our peers, programmed, programmed to view ourselves in the universe in a particular way.

And we respond by the time we're adults like robots to circumstances. We do what we should do or supposed to do. Well, what practice is about, what realization is about, is getting underneath all of that program, peeling it back layer by layer, getting to that ground of being, realizing that ground of being.

Because underneath all of that stuff is a person, and realizing that, and learning to live one's life out of that realization, not what you're told or not what you should believe or not what I say or what the Buddha said or anybody else said, but out of your own direct and immediate experience.

And it is that an experience. It has nothing to do with the words and ideas that describe it. It's the reality itself. It has nothing to do with understanding. It has nothing to do with believing. It's an experience, and that experience is transformative.

Only you can settle it. It's not something someone can give you. You need to empower yourself to put it to rest. And the way to do it is the Dharma gate of liberation, Zazen. To study the self is to forget the self, and to forget the self is Zazen.

Whole body and mind Zazen. It's right there that the question comes, and it's right there that the question is put to rest. The answers are to be found on this mountain. This mountain is you. This mountain is your life.

But it's not an easy climb. The way is covered with boulders and steep cliffs, all of the barriers, all of the baggage, the mist is heavy, and its exact location is unknown. You must trust yourself in order to find it.

Your determination and doubt must also be strong. Takes those three things: great faith, great doubt, and great determination to do it. And keep in mind, whatever you discover along the way, just simply acknowledge it, and let it go, throw it away, and keep going.

And when you finally find out what it is that you're seeking, acknowledge that too, throw it away, and keep going. The journey is endless, but it's a wonderful journey. Bon voyage.
