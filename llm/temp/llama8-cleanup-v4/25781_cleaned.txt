Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:

The God does true meaning. Good morning, everyone. And Adeshi mentioned last night that he could use some time to get all of his camping equipment, all ten pounds of it into the five-pound sack, so you have me today rather than him.

Planting flowers on a smooth river rock. Or now what will you do? Yaoshan says to Shitao, I comprehend the basic sutras that clarify all manifestation, yet I long to receive the radical transmission by which the master points directly to mind, allowing the disciple to realize mind's nature and thereby become a living Buddha.

Shitao says, No step-by-step understanding will work. The sudden approach won't work either, nor will any combination of the two. Now what are you going to do? Stunned, Yaoshan stands speechless for a few moments. Before he can gather any thoughts whatsoever, the uncompromising Shitao sternly sends him to visit the mountain of Master Ma.

Entering the more gentle atmosphere, it's said, of Matsu, the aspirant once again requests direct pointing to mind. Master Ma replies, Only the one mind raises these eyebrows and blinks these eyelids. Sometimes gestures occur, sometimes not. It makes no difference. Now what are you going to do?

This translator then says, Flooded suddenly with omniconscious light, the potential successor melts into a deep bow. Master Ma says, What glimpse have you received that causes you to bow so profoundly? Yaoshan says, When standing before Shitao, it felt completely different, like a mosquito attempting to bite an iron ox.

Master Ma said, Through the wonderful kindness of Shitao, you are awakened, but you must refine it. Those of you who were here for my Shusa Hosen know that I have a particular relationship with that line, like a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. It's part of the ceremony of becoming a senior student when you give your first talk.

After you do so, you basically apologize for the mess you've made. And part of your apology is to say, It felt like a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. I felt like that. I was so nervous, I said, I felt like an iron bull trying to bite a mosquito. Which had the same feeling of impossibility.

So, Shitao is the prime teacher here. The original teacher. He's basically answering Yaoshan's question. Saying there's nothing you can do. Or not do. Nothing will get you there. Nothing works. Nothing will open it. You can go slow. You can go fast. You can go gradually. You can go completely. Hopefully, you'll never arrive.

In one sense, a way to understand what's happening with Shitao is he's pointing out the absoluteness of relativity. That if what you're seeking is the absolute, the true essence, the ultimate, you're entering into an impossible activity because every experience is relative by its nature. If you experience it, it's relative. It didn't exist. It did. And eventually, it won't. It's an experience.

So, any experience is relative. In some sense, this is often called the father energy in Zen. The absolute, the kind of massive, what Thurman calls the massive facticity of the mountain. You know, that you can't quite reach it. There's no way there. There's no one. And the frustration of that impenetrability, that inability to find connection, to find entry.

It reminded me of, in the last weekend's introduction to Zen, we deal with the moral and ethical teachings, the precepts. And one of the students who was attending at the group session at the end, which is a little less formal, and people tend to really say more what's in their guts, you know, like what's bothering them.

And this one man raised his hand and said, but this killing thing, you know, you say no killing. And yet, you know, I've been here on Sundays. You guys serve meat. You know, what is this precept on non-killing? How do you understand that? And in a way, it was such a beautiful reflection of that process we all go through, that moment of really looking at what is it to commit yourself to truth, to living in a way that's clear.

And he's taking up the implications of that commitment. And, you know, one way of answering it is to explain different perspectives on the precept, which are obvious. You know, you can say the precept of not killing means don't kill. That's the truth of it. Just don't kill. That's the heart of the matter.

And then there's another perspective that says, but there's a time when the only way to keep that precept is when out of compassion and reverence for all life, you do kill. And Ida, she often gives the example of, you know, you're hiking deep in the woods. You're alone and you're distant and you come upon a wounded animal that is suffering greatly, just calling out in its pain.

And it's obvious it's going to die, it's going to pass. And in its meeting with you, it's clear, you know, to your spinal column, clear, that what's called for is to relieve this suffering, that whatever is, you know, mental that could be learned from this process of dying, that it's a clear message. It's time to alleviate the suffering here.

And if out of some kind of selfish withdrawing into not wanting to deal with this issue or it seems icky or you know you can just walk away, you don't respond to that suffering by killing this animal, then you've broken the precept, the heart of the precept, do not kill. So out of compassion and reverence for life, realize do not kill.

And then there's another perspective, the wholeness, in which who could possibly kill what? There's nothing outside you. There's no one to kill anything. Killing is impossible. Why? And what's the implication, the deep, living Buddha life, of manifesting that precept? We each take that on when we enter consciously into a life that we call practice.

Do we become a vegetarian? Do we protest abortion or support it? Do we, you know, how do we respond to a war that seems just, is in response to some horrendous suffering? How do we deal with that? Or as Shitao and Baso, Matsu said, now what will you do? It's one thing to understand. But what will you do?

And this is where the koan begins to come to life. Master Ma's position in this, Baso, Master Matsu, is basically saying, you know, everything functions, everything reveals the truth. How could it be otherwise? It's the great dance, our Dharma cousin, Lex Hickson calls it, the great dance of eyebrows, stars, branches, and banners in the bright wind.

And if it's all one, then there's no action, no thing, no place, no one that isn't the truth. There's no escaping reality. It's everything seen, felt, touched, tasted. Sometimes gestures occur, sometimes not. It makes no difference. So on the one hand, you have Shitao. You stand before the great iron ox of nothing works.

And in that, we say, the student becomes already enlightened. Nothing needed. This is the Buddha's statement of original perfection. And it's in response to this that Kazon says, even though he wasn't aware of it, Yao Shen became a true human being at that moment. When he realized Shitao's point.

And then the second point, through the eyebrows and the humorous blinking of the eyes of Master Mao, that original perfection, that wakefulness beginning to move, take expression, refining him into someone fluid, alive, expressing everywhere, every way, the father of ineffable mind, the mother gracious expression of mind.

Is it one or is it two? And what do you do? It's not a poem. It's not out there. It's not someone else's issue. Sometimes father, sometimes mother, no difference. There are teachings in some schools of Buddhism that have always struck me as really peculiar that describe training, Buddhist training, as kind of sneaking up on reality.

If you go directly, you know, you're going to, it's like trying to catch the feather with the fan or calm the water by, you know, putting your hand down on it just makes more waves. But if you kind of sneak up, you know, and from the side, peek in on reality, you know, then you'll see it. And suddenly awaken.

But it's still an experience. So what are you going to do? Yaoshin in this poem, Yakuza, for those of you who know the Japanese names, was an ardent monk, it said. He got ordained at the age of 16. And he was a very sensitive scholar of the sutras.

It said that his feel for the teaching was like someone who could, you know, put their hand up and know the wind, its current, its direction, its strength, its consequence. That he was, he was that committed and awake in his intelligence and his heart.

And a very careful practitioner of the discipline, the kind of monos, the monastic discipline. There was no other agenda in his life. And so whatever form was given him with the intention to awaken, that he would take it up with that same ardent commitment.

Which is, you know, I think in one way part of what this lineage is trying to create in this country. That capacity to commit to a form. You know, it's like, sure, it can be anything. And because it can be anything, let's do this. And really do it thoroughly.

Because we're so used to not making that commitment. But even though he was, you know, ardent and sensitive and careful, he was still in the middle of a spiritual crisis by the time he got to these teachers. And the crisis was basically, he felt no direct, conscious connection to Buddha nature, to the essence of his own mind.

There was still a sense of distance, of being a stranger in this life. But after having received this very direct teaching from these two teachers, he was cooking. And he's unusual in that most of the traditional stories contain those two elements, the mother and father, or the killing and giving life element in one teacher.

In Yasham's life, it was embodied in two distinct teachers. So he, after these meetings, then became the attendant for a while of Master Ma, several years. And it's said that after three years of that, Master Ma sensed that something had shifted, that he was clearer in what he'd already realized.

And he asked him about his daily awareness. And Yasham said, I'm the snake that shed its skin. That only one bright, clear reality remains. Like those locust shells that you find on the tree. The old body, all the self-idea has been released. Only one bright, clear reality remains.

But what is that? What's he doing? How can you speak without creating another locust shell? Regardless, Master Ma said, joyfully confirms this to be the refinement he'd been waiting for. And that joyfully confirms is for me, whenever a phrase like that appears in colon study, something that kind of winces my heart.

You know, it's like, sure, it can be anything. And because it can be anything, let's do this. And really do it thoroughly. Because we're so used to not making that commitment. But even though he was, you know, ardent and sensitive and careful, he was still in the middle of a spiritual crisis by the time he got to these teachers.

And the crisis was basically, he felt no direct, conscious connection to Buddha nature, to the essence of his own mind. There was still a sense of distance, of being a stranger in this life. But after having received this very direct teaching from these two teachers, he was cooking.

The interviewer asked Mizumi Roshi about this kind of cooking process, this encountering of the stone. And he says that he had been reading something by D.T. Suzuki that morning. Said that Suzuki said that the crisis in which transformation or insight is made possible is like boiling oil over a blazing fire.

The interviewer then says that sounds a little dramatic, but there is this crisis in one form or another in all traditions that precedes enlightenment, certainly in the Buddha's own life, is that part of the natural flowering. And then Roshi says, in a way there is a crisis, but it seems to me crisis is a little too strong a term.

It's not necessary to have a crisis, but instead a total devotion of the heart to the way. In the Soto School we would rather emphasize the natural flowering than having a crisis of pushing yourself into a hard position where you have to leap out from ordinary happenings.

It's better to have a strong, definite faith in yourself, to identify yourself with Zazen, with wisdom itself. Then somehow, then somehow, we go on and when the right time comes by any chance, that awareness just takes place, so to speak.

Or rather, you are suddenly, totally convinced of what is true. And then he refers to something the interviewer had mentioned earlier. He says, you mentioned humor, and that is a kind of natural occurrence too, since truth is such an obvious thing.

This whole way of working is part of this particular cluster of teachers at that time. Many of us have dealt in our formal Cohen study with the piece on the visiting monk coming to Master Ma, Basso's monastery, who's apparently not always regarded as having a gentler mountain.

So this visiting monk comes to Master Ma and says, beyond all the propositions and all the negations about reality, and that's that via negativa, it's not this and it's not that, and it's not going suddenly, and it's not going gradually, it's not absolute, and it's not relative, it's beyond all that negation, and beyond all the constructions of expressed truth, please show me the direct meaning of Bodhidharma arriving in the country, or the meaning of Buddhism, meaning of truth.

And Matsu says, I just don't feel like explaining it today, go ask the head monk, this visiting monk, go find the head monk, and says, can you show me this direct pointing to the meaning of Buddhism, and the head monk says, God, I've got a headache today, why don't you go ask the cook.

And the man's wanders through the monastery, comes to the kitchen, finds the cook, and says, okay, I'm looking for direct pointing at the meaning of Buddhism, can you do this, and the cook says, I used to know that, I used to know it, but I've forgotten, but I do make a really good soup, would you like some soup.

And the monk says, no, your head monk's a sick man, your cook can't even think anymore, he has some Alzheimer's thing, what kind of monastery is this, and he leaps, and Father Ken in Basa then says, the head monk's head is white, and the cook's head is black.

And the monk, having now missed five direct presentations of the meaning of Buddhism, kind of wanders off still looking for it, and Father Kennedy, another of our Dharma cousins, writes in his recent book, he says he likes to imagine later that evening after dinner, the three of them are sitting around sipping a little rice wine.

And the head monk says to Basa, so did that visiting monk find the meaning of Buddhism? Basa says, I don't think so, he seemed very disappointed with us, and the cook says, yeah, and he didn't even taste the soup.

How do we stay on target? This is my segue to Kudo weekend without knowing, and thus being apart from the target, without disbanding all motivation, is how can we not be motivated? Even in the statement of realization, go teach, Basa says, ultimate truth is not a part from those who are suffering.

How can we not be motivated? We want to put an end to our spiritual crisis, that sense of being a stranger, of being apart. Most of us feel, I've discovered, that we're somehow unique in that motivation. Everybody else is really part of this one thing, and somehow we're outside.

They all know what's going on, they all love each other, and somehow we're just like this chink that arrived from outer space, you know, and it's foreign matter in the body of being. And so we look for it and we want to enter.

Another. But we miss it because we keep waiting for it to be explained. We want an answer. And we confuse that answer for what we're really seeking. We want to live in communion. We want to be completely at home.

And yet our conditioning is to step back, pick up the pack of everything we understand that has in some way made us feel moderately safe, or at least familiar with our shit, and carry it with us. And because it's so heavy, the cocks are back and we can't see the step that's right in front of us.

All of the teachers through antiquity have basically said one thing. Put down the pack, sit down, trust yourself. Trust yourself as wisdom itself. You want direct experience of reality, experience reality.

Mary Oliver who I've been Mary Oliver to me is a poet who feels like someone who is able to hold the fire fly for a moment without killing it. She's able to present that wonder with a kind of grace that's unusual.

And I wanted to read a poem that she writes similar to this teaching. She calls it wild geese and begins you don't have to be good. You don't have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.

You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. Tell me about your despair and I will tell you mine. Meanwhile the world goes on. Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes over the prairies and the deep trees the mountains and the rivers.

Meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air are heading home again. Whoever you are no matter how lonely the world offers itself to your imagination calls to you like wild geese harsh and exciting over and over announcing your place as a great truth.

As we end this time of training together this weekend this morning of sitting I'd like to encourage all of us to really go to that question to face what seems impossible to ask the question as deeply as clearly as sincerely as you can and to be willing to encounter that stone because through that the flower blossoms blossoms never been not present it's nothing other than our life but what will you do to ask the question is the stupidest thing because it pulls back and yet to not ask is to sit in idleness without clarity so what will you do what will each of us do at the very least we should not ignore the possibility of that flowering please take care of all the ten thousand things dogan said to study the mind to really ask is to study the self and to study the self is to forget the self and to forget the self is to be right so I ng I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
