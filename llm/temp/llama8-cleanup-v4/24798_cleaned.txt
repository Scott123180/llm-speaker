Satsang with Mooji

In the book of Equanimity, I always admire the novel devices of Unman. All his life he pulled out the nails and wedges for people. Why did he sometimes open the door and set out a bowl of glue? Or dig a pitfall in the middle of the road? Try to understand this.

The main case: A monk asked Unman, "When not producing a single thought, is there any fault or not?"

Not producing a single thought, Unman's gift of teaching is not stingy in intent. If you come with acceptance, he imparts it with both hands. If you go on doubting, it's so high you can't get a hold.

The blue ocean is wide, the white clouds are peaceful. Don't put so much as the tip of a hair in there. A phony cock crow can hardly fool me. I still won't agree to let you pass.

The preface: The Great Master. Very novel. And Unman and Joshu are both known for what's called "lips and mouth zen." Where their words kept going to see Unman. And it was kind of like getting the door slammed into space.

He decided to make a move. So when the door opened, so Unman did an occasion. His life was a pretty remarkable one. He's a successor of Master Seppo. So he's in that Seppo lineage. And he's in the same bloodline.

After his study with... It's kind of interesting. It shows all. He finally ended up with Master Seppo. And at that time, Seppo had a huge monastery. And several great masters. So Unman's Dharma brothers were all very well known to us.

There were people like Gensha Kyose, Choke, Hofoku, Zui Gan. All of whom one way or another made a name for themselves with their teachings. And thousands of monks and lay practitioners studying at Seppo's monastery.

One of the characteristics of that group of Dharma siblings is that they would always work with each other. Also, Unman taught. Took over a monastery that he was the head monk for. And the head of that monastery had a nice relationship with the emperor.

And then when the old man died, Unman took over. The emperor took a liking to Unman and gave him all kinds of things for a while. But the monastery had been... Because of all this recognition by the emperor, a lot of people started coming there. And there was a steady stream of visitors.

And so the emperor led him. And at one point, the emperor called him to the palace. The emperor said, "What's Zen all about?" And Unman said, "Your majesty has the question." The emperor said, "What answer?" And Unman said, "I request your majesty to..."

The emperor kind of liked it and said, "I know your personal precepts, and I have respected them for a long time." And he appointed him the Office of the Inspector of Monks of the Capital. That was his title.

And when he announced that to Unman, Unman didn't say anything. And that was the path he's not likely to enjoy. The emperor said, "Shall we let you return to your mountain?" And at that, from his silence, absolute silence, Unman jumped up and down and shouted three times in joy.

So the emperor gave him all kinds of goods from the treasury and incense and medicinal herbs and donations. And gave him another title called "genuine truth." And let him go back to his monastery. And from then on, in was a patron.

And so his life went on. He had many successes. He had taught for... I forget how many years. He was in his slate. He was 79. And there's a stone inscription that gives the account of his death.

When the attendant offered him a hot broth, the master handed the bowl back and said, "First, first, I'm fine. Second, you're fine." And be sure to write a letter to request my leave from the emperor. And then he himself wrote a document with his...

The reason I'm telling you this stuff is that the joy of studying these records of the ancient masters, these koans, which is after all... Person cleared their throat or gestured their personal stuff is what I have a sense of. And it's so much reflected in the way they teach.

Because every one of these people taught very, very differently. And their personality came out in their teaching. And the more you get a sense of a person, so it's a valuable thing to have a sense of their personality, a feel for their lives, what their life was like.

So he wrote this little admission for posterity, which went something like... After my death, I permit neither the wearing of mourning clothes in conformity with worldly custom nor wailing and holding a ceremony with a funeral carriage. This would be a violation of the Buddhist precepts and a source of trouble for the Zen school.

He then transmitted the Dharma to one of his successors. And oh, the boat of compassion having been destroyed, Samsara will not attain the shore of salvation. The Dharma mountain having crumbled, they followed his instructions and left him in the sitting position and entombed him in his quarters. That was his request. Don't be reclining.

The congregation was left, and one hid their faces in their collars and stood around crying. So later, and seventy, seventy years later, some emperor or magistrate, Umman appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to open the doors to this place where he was by now mummified.

Seventy, seventy, and it said that when it was opened, the master's body was found unchanged except that its hair and fingernails and toenails had grown longer. The eyes, the eyes were half-open and glistened like pearls. The teeth sparkled. Eyelids still, he grinned with his eyes open and long fingernails.

And I'm sure a glow filled the room. You know. So everybody got excited, and they brought the mummy to the capital so all people could see it. And everything. And then finally, when everybody had their fill of it, they sent it back to the monastery. And it was kept there for over a thousand years.

And in 1970, so old Umman, why did he sometimes... Oh, gets stuck. And the pit. Compassionate. When not producing a single thought, is there any fault or not? And what the monk is saying. And one of the things that that's tough with Umman is because so much of what he says is based like Dogen is based on his use of language.

It becomes very critical in how the translators translate. And this book I enjoyed very much. And I have no way of evaluating the translator other than the fact that the translations seem consistent with the other translations of the koans. I don't particularly care very much for his interpretation. It's wrong. It's just that it's very intellectual.

And there's a whole other dimension to Umman's teaching. So not a fault or no fault is what this monk is bringing up. We're not producing a single thought, of course. When the mind is very quiet, still focused. No mind, still point is reached. No activity. And the question the monk wants to know is there any fault or not? Is this good or is it bad?

Supposedly, it reaches the heavens and covers the earth. And all kinds of wonderful stories about Mount Sumeru. The national teacher commenting on this is this case is debated everywhere. Some say as soon as one questions in this way, already this is raising a thought. And of course, that's true. That's the first thing that you see.

This monk comes, says we're not producing a single thought, is there any fault or not? Well, he's producing a stream of thoughts. But Joshu once responded to a similar thing with the monk, the monk says, "How is it when there are no thoughts?" Some say as soon as one questions this way, already this is raising a thought. A fault as big as Mount Sumeru.

Some say it is like Mount Sumeru, unmoved by the eight winds. These are different ways of looking at this. But the national teacher says such assessments have not yet comprehended Umman's meaning. Only if the bottom of the bucket has fallen out and the red thread is broken off. The red thread is referred to sometimes as the red thread of passion or the red thread of delusion.

So we get entangled with cut the thread, you cut that loose. So only then will you realize it's not true that this is the way of understanding Umman's teaching. And then he goes on to say, "Haven't you heard it said that three phrases illuminate one phrase? The one phrase illuminates the three phrases. Three and one do not intermingle distinctly clear the road going beyond."

There's often a mention of Umman's three phrases. It's said that every teaching of Umman, every phrase that he uttered, always contained three phrases. One is it touches, reaches the heaven and encompasses the earth. That is the phrase. The single phrase immediately presents the absolute basis of reality.

The second is it follows the way. So not only does it encompass heaven and cover the earth, it responds to the need of the student appropriately. And the third is it cuts off the myriad streams of thought that you can't take hold of it intellectually. And it's true if you look at Umman's phrases, all three of those are always present.

It always reveals the absolute basis of reality. It always is appropriate to the particular questioner in the koan. And it always is incomprehensible. That's what it means, cuts off the myriad streams of thoughts means you can't grasp it intellectually. It's not an idea. It's not about the words and ideas that describe reality. It's the direct reality itself.

So this is no different from Mount Sumeru. Another master said Umman's answer has provoked conscious feelings in many people. I say he uses conscious feelings to get rid of conscious feelings. If he did not help people in a great way, he would be unable to do anything at all. So he uses conscious feelings to get rid of conscious feelings.

That is, he uses words to dispel words. Seeing the cage, he builds a cage. So this Mount Sumeru that he says can can can be covered by the heavens by the sky. Earth cannot support it. Fills the universe. Wind blowing cannot enter it. Water pour on it cannot wet it. Only the diamond eye can see it at a glance.

To wrote a poem about it and he says, "Mount Sumeru, it fills the universe. Even the ten thousand armed great compassionate one cannot see through it." If you know on your own how to ride an ox backward, you'll never stick facing the direction that the ox is moving in.

And this image of riding the ox backward in the phrase usually goes riding the ox backward into the Buddha hall. The hall of Buddhas is an expression of freedom of being able to manifest any which way in accordance with the circumstances. And if you can do that, that is if you're free, you'll never and in the verse to this koan it says, "Not producing a single thought, Mount Sumeru."

Footnote to that line says, "Finish in one line right there in that poem in that verse, not producing a single thought, Mount Sumeru says the whole thing finishes the corn." Umman's gift of teaching is not stingy in fact, he's given everything. He's held back absolutely nothing.

And then the next couple lines tell you what's necessary in order to appreciate it. If you come with acceptance, he imparts it with both hands. Footnote to that says, "I'm only afraid you can't take it on." What's he giving you? The whole universe is what he's given you. The whole universe is what he's given in that one phrase, Mount Sumeru.

If you go on doubting, it's so high you can't take hold of it. So when you separate yourself in the doubting, there's separation, there's you and it. Then it's in the phrase if you go on doubting, it's so high you can't get hold of it. The footnote to that says, "It's a wasted effort. Floods the heavens, bades the sun. It's so wide that it has no shoreline. It reaches everywhere. The white clouds are peaceful. Follow the wind. Don't put so much as the tip of a hair in there."

The moment you add anything extra to it, the moment you try to name it, the moment you define it. If you come with acceptance, he imparts it with both hands. An old master said, "Wait until... to the koan student, to the teacher, koan to the teacher, teacher to the student. All has to do with developing intimacy, getting to that when the student sees the koan, the student meets themselves.

And at that very moment, the teacher meets themselves. And at that very moment, the teacher meets the student. I still won't agree to let you pass through the gate in confusion. And the phony cock crow is about to do with an old story about a couple of people sneaking out of the kingdom in order to get through the gate.

The pass they were only allowed to pass through when the cock crow and all the hens responded. And when not producing a single thought, is there any fault or not? The commentary says, "A fellow whose words are pure but whose conduct is impure. The words sound good, but there's nothing underneath it. It's one thing to be able to say it and quite another to be able to be it."

So down further, the phony cock crow can hardly fool me. Is that student look like a rooster and crow like a rooster and waddle like a rooster? But he's not a rooster. And then the last line, I still want to be able to nourish yourself and to nourish others. If you come with acceptance, he imparts it with both hands.

If you come with the whole body and mind, you'll immediately realize he's got nothing to give. Good advice for working on any form, go to it with the whole body and mind, and you'll receive it with both hands. Without any in go on thinking, and it becomes a gigantic barrier that touches the whole body and mind. You become the barrier.

That collected Hong Ji that collected made this collection shared that reality. In one of the person that added the commentary, the comments same thing. What what is that reality? Joshua said, "Cypress tree in the garden." Oman said, "Rice cakes." Another time he said, "The flowering hedge." Rinzai last night it would keep in mind how different people see things.

How different people may see the same thing is different. But is that because or that the same thing appears differently to different people? There are many ways of seeing these koans. That's why the whole notion of an answer to a koan book that appeared some years ago is ridiculous.

As if there were an answer. There are a hundred ways, two hundred ways of seeing any one koan. And there are many levels of it. And different teachers will point out different aspects of it according to whatever the circumstances are that they're using it in teaching.

Many times Umman would take up a koan of another master and give a whole different side to it. It wasn't that what the master said was wrong and the Oman said was right. It was just another way of seeing exactly the same thing. Sometimes right within the same teacher, they would give two different answers.

But the same truth was functioning. We need to appreciate that fact and not get hooked on the right answer to a koan. The right answer in a very deliberate way, it's always covered in the mist so that you stumble and find your way. And it's not only important to ascend that mountain.

When people ask me what does this sitting have to do with my life and the problems I have at the office and stuff like that or what do koans have to do with life? I don't know whether that we're involved in a process that touches every aspect of our life. But you got to make the connection yourself in your life.

All these hassles in the world, well, we do our best to create hassles for you here so that you have the opportunity to see how to work your way through it. Well, all kinds of anger at work. Well, we try to do that here. And it's much easier and safer to work it out in the button.

Get a book that hasn't been written. You're writing it as you practice. And if you're not connecting it with your life, if you're spending all this time sitting and working with koans and studying and you're not connecting it with your life, you're...
