Four, five, six, seven. Once you have achieved peaceful stillness of body and mind, you must make earnest effort. Do not immediately settle down in peaceful stillness. In the teachings, this is called the deep pit of liberation. Much to be feared.

You must make yourself turn freely, like a gourd floating on the water, independent and free, not subject to restraints, entering purity and impurity without being obstructed or sinking down. Only then do you have a little familiarity with the school of the patch-robed monks. If you just manage to cradle the un-crying child in your arms, what's the use?

This is from the collected letters, teaching letters of Master Da Wei, who was one of the successors of Master Ingo back in the 11th, 12th century China. Ingo is the compiler of the Blue Cliff Record, and Da Wei, one of his most prominent students. And he taught a lot of, he was the teacher in the abbot of a monastery, but he also taught a lot of lay people. And a lot of that teaching happened through letters.

Once you have achieved perfect stillness of body and mind. We talk a lot about stillness in Zen. And there are different ways to understand and experience this stillness. Yasutani Roshi talked about there being five different kinds of Zen. In a sense, he was talking about five different aspirations for practicing Zen.

He said the first had nothing to do really with religious practice. It was just wanting to improve our mental health, our sort of our general sense of well-being. And so using Zazen is just a form of meditation to do that, to quiet the mind. And through that, to get in touch with ourself a bit and just sort of calm down.

He said the second kind was a kind of Zen that was outside of Buddhism. In other words, it had religious content in that it was a way of practicing that was part of a process of self-inquiry. But it had nothing to do with Buddhist teachings. So yogic meditation or practice, Christian contemplation, all these would be part of this kind of Zen.

He said there was another kind that was concerned with the experience of emptiness. With the experience of stillness of body and mind. A complete stillness. A thorough, utter kind of stopping. But that's all. It's just really about that. This is the kind of practice that we associate with the Theravadan school, where that realization of the emptiness of all things is what the focal point is.

And he said there, then, is a kind of Zen that has to do with awakening to our true nature. Specifically meaning realizing that Zazen is a process of actualizing that true nature. That realizing the self is empty is, from this way of seeing things, incomplete. And then finally, the fifth rank of Master Tozan, to realize that the process and the goal have always been the same thing, are inherently unified.

So when we talk about stillness, in a sense we have to get clear on what we mean by that. Once you have achieved perfect stillness of body and mind. Is he just talking about quieting down? Being able to get to ten? Or is he talking about something else?

He says, don't immediately settle down in this peaceful stillness. In the teachings, this is called the deep pit of liberation. One of the interesting things, you know, Dardash has said on several occasions how we have to remember, we have to always remember that the teachings that we read and hear about always occurred within a very specific point in time.

And that the teacher was always, you know, it wasn't a general teaching. It wasn't for general consumption. It was very specific. That teacher was talking to a selected group of people that were sitting in front of them. Or on the other end of a letter, in this case. And it was the teacher's understanding of that group of people or that person that determined what the teaching was.

And so when we take those teachings out of context and put them in a book and separate them by hundreds or a thousand years and cultures and time and space, it's very easy to read them in a general way. And with that issue is mentioned that we have to understand that a lot of these teachings were being geared towards people, monks and nuns, who were in monastic training and were stuck in the experience of emptiness.

Because the danger of not understanding that is that we can read something like this and think that the message is basically, you know, drop that experience of stillness. That that's not what it's about. It's about being free and independent within the day-to-day functioning of our life. That it's about being active, which is, of course, true.

But, you know, if we really read this, he says, once you have achieved peaceful stillness. So he's talking to somebody who's already experienced an essential dropping away of body and mind. So he's not saying it's not important. He's simply saying once you have experienced that, then you must really make effort to not settle down there, to not get caught in that.

And that's really critical because without that experience, really, there is no Buddhist practice. That's what practice is all about. That's, in a sense, where it really begins. When we say that the questions, and that our questions and our answers come from the same place, the question is, where is that place? We say deep within each one of us, but where? Where within each one of us?

Where is that wisdom seed that we're tapping into? Well, it comes out of this experience of stillness, of the falling away of body and mind. And it's kind of interesting because not only is that where the answers, but that's where we resolve our questions. But that's where the questions come from, too.

And one of the aspects of practice is that in the beginning, one of the reasons that our reasons for practicing can be so confused or so obscured is because our mind is obscured and confused. So many of us enter into practice just responding. I mean, every time we have guardian council meetings with people applying to be students, we're reminded of this, you know, how difficult it is to really be able to get in touch with, to feel, to be able to articulate why we're doing this thing.

But once we've really gone deep to that place, to that peaceful stillness, the questions become very, very clear. Because there's nothing in the way. There's no obstruction. So as the mind becomes attuned or unified, the depth, our ability to really inquire, to probe, to examine, takes on a whole different kind of potential.

And that's why when, sometimes when we begin a koan practice, like the question, what is moved? A lot of times the first question is, what the hell does that mean? I mean, I don't even understand what the question is. So how do I work with this question when I've got a question about the question? I don't even know where to start.

Well, that's part of the beauty of Mu, is that it's fresh, it's clean, it has no history. As opposed to sitting with something like, what is truth? You know, we bring dictionaries and encyclopedias encyclopedias of meaning about that into our city. But Mu is just what? But as we practice and through the practice of Mu get into that place of no mind, of no thinking, of thinking no thought, what Mu is becomes abundantly apparent.

What the question, what is Mu is, becomes very clear. So it's for this reason that we can't, we can't practice koans without, with an agitated mind. Because we can't even get to the question. Or if we do, it's just a kind of intellectual thing. So that stillness of mind is not just critical to the penetration of that koan, but to the koan itself, to the questioning itself.

Which of course makes sense because the whole thing is about intimacy. And that's why a lot of times the experience or the feeling is that, you know, to really enter on the path to really move along, it gets worse before it gets better. Because what we're doing is we're getting closer and closer to the real heart of the problem.

So this is why it's so important to really investigate our own practice, particularly in Zazen. You know, are we just sitting on the surface? Are we going deep within ourself? Are we, you know, there are a hundred thousand ways to back away from that still point. You know, over the years I've seen it again and again.

Sometimes, you know, sitting with people regularly, suddenly, you know, I started to become aware that every single period of Zazen this person calls, clears their throat. You know, and usually when I begin to really see that it's a pattern, I'll go up to them and say, do you know that you're doing this? Most of the time they're completely unaware that it's happening.

But what that means is every single period of Zazen, there's that backing away. So it's really a matter of dropping in, dropping down, and seeing the ways from which we prevent ourself from doing that. You know, that's one of the vital aspects of just sitting in one place. Of being able to stay in one place. Both within a single moment in time and also over time.

You know, that's why this practice really only works if we carry it through over time. Because through that process there's a natural maturation, just like there is with anything. Any relationship, any discipline, any endeavor. You know, we don't really begin to see what it has to offer, what the potential is, until we've just been there a while.

That desire to really throw away, to let drop that agitated, constantly moving mind, and it takes some sincerity. It takes some real desire to do that. You know, we have to want to do that. Which basically just comes down to really trusting that. Trusting that process. Trusting ourself.

And then what? As Dawe said, then we have to increase our effort even more. We have to turn freely like a gourd floating on the water, independent and free. Not subject to restraints. Entering purity and impurity without obstruction. If we can only cradle the un-crying child, what's the use?

Indeed. In the Lankavatara Sutra, the Buddha said the same thing this way. He said, having attained this exalted and blissful condition of self-realization is realized by the Saravikas, which are people who have pursued this experience of emptiness, of dropping away body and mind.

He says, bodhisattvas may not enjoy by themselves the bliss of cessation, the bliss of samadhi, but should think compassionately of other beings and keep ever fresh their original vows. That is, the vows to save all sentient beings. So he's saying, having realized this still point, this stillness of body and mind, you can't just sit there and enjoy it.

You have to remember there's a world out there. There's a crying child in addition to the one that's not crying. The way Daudishy says it, if that's all we do is enter into that emptiness, what the hell good is it if it's not functioning, if it's not a part of our life?

So how do we do this earnest effort? In another letter, Thawai says, I see that you're unremitting in your conduct, that you're not carried away by the press of your official duties, that in the midst of swift flowing streams, you vigorously examine yourself.

Far from being lax, your aspiration to the path grows ever more firm as time goes on. That's what it's about. In the midst of swift flowing streams, you vigorously examine yourself. That's why it's so important. That's why it's so essential to be able to do that examination with nothing, with no stimulation.

Coming out of that place of stillness, because if we can't do it there, we sure as hell aren't going to be able to do it when we're in the middle of a tornado. Things are happening too quickly. The mind is moving too fast. We can't see it. We get lost.

That's why we press on all the details of training. That's what training is. That's why we take something very ordinary like eating a meal and say don't miss a single thing. Notice how you pick up the spoon. Notice how you put it down. Notice how you lay out the claw.

Because if we can't do that, then we won't be able to do it in an ordinary situation. So we train in a very sort of specialized environment that leads up to a completely free, uncontrolled situation. It's kind of interesting though.

If self-nature, if our true nature is empty, then why isn't it enough just to sit there and enjoy the stillness? Why do we have to go out and deal with all the craziness of the world? Well, that argument about why do it is really kind of nonsense.

You know, it's like a parent saying, you know, no matter what I do, matter how much I give myself to the raising of my child, they're still going to have problems. And I'm going to be a part of those problems. But nobody thinks, well, then I'll just bag it. It's no point in trying.

Of course not. There's anything that's important to us that we really want to give our life to. Present in that first moment of having entered into that particular area is the fact that we'll never complete it, we'll never finish. But that doesn't stop us.

So, you know, these vows are not just about, not just capturing the spirit and the reality of the Buddha Dharma, but they're expressing the reality of life. You know, it's just a matter of us, we usually don't look at it quite so directly.

You know, and really, when you see someone who's mastered something, it's because what they're studying and pursuing is unattainable, and they've dedicated themselves to it wholeheartedly. It makes them a master.

It always says, right in the midst of the hubbub, you mustn't forget the business of the bamboo chair and the reed cushion. That means the zafu, the zabata. Usually, to meditate, you set your mind on a still concentration point, but you must be able to use it right in the midst of the commotion.

If you have no strength there, after all, it's as if you never made any effort in stillness at all. If you consider quietude right and commotion wrong, then this is seeking the real aspect by destroying the worldly, seeking nirvana, the piece of extinction, apart from birth and death.

When you like the quiet and hate the hubbub, this is just the time to apply effort. Suddenly, when in the midst of all of that craziness, you topple the scene of quietude, that power surpasses the meditation seat and cushion by a million, billion times.

In a sense, this is all that our practice is, is first giving us a container, a way, to enter into this stillness, which is simply our self. Clean, naked, fresh. And then, it presents us with the commotion, with the chaos, with the confusion.

Whether we're training here or whether we're training somewhere else. It's the same chaos, it's the same commotion, it's the same practice. In a sense, that's all we're doing with our training, our programs. This weekend we do haiku and shakuhachi. In a sense, that's a part, an element of that is creating, introducing complications.

And Dawei is saying, in the midst of that, in the moment, where it's all spiraling out of control, don't forget. Don't forget your cushion. And what he means is, don't forget what zazen is, don't forget practice. Don't forget the business of your cushion.

Don't forget the work that you do there, don't forget what that's really all about, which is that very moment that's spiraling into craziness. And this, to me, seems in many ways the key thing, not forgetting.

I was thinking about this last seshin. I mean, you know, seshin is a situation where every single thing that happens is deliberately designed to, in a sense, help us to remember, to practice, and to get us to practice. And I don't know how many times during the course of the week, during an interview, basically what I was saying is, remember zazen? Remember counting the breath?

You know, one person is working on a book. That they've been stuck with for a few years. Suddenly, they have a creative impulse. Everything becomes clear. The chapters just roll out. And that's their practice of seshin.

Somebody else is taking, you know, counting the breath, and is suddenly drawing pictures in the sky, numbers in the sand. You know, there's a little MGM production. Just remembering to practice. Not forgetting the business of the cushion.

And that's really it. To remember in the midst of the commotion. And having the strength, having the resource of that stillness. Because if we don't, then what happens in that moment of craziness is, well, we do the best we can. But when we've experienced that, then the wisdom that comes directly out of that is present, is applicable.

And the whole question of what's the relevance between one thing and another. You know, what's the, how do you integrate that stillness and the functioning? It's clear, it's abundant. It doesn't always mean we can do it. But what needs to be done is obvious.

Sometimes we may just not choose to. And sometimes maybe that conditioning is just a little bit stronger. But there's the, there's the real clear sense of what practice is in that moment.

So remembering simply to practice, remembering that life is swiftly passing by. This is the Bodhi Mind being raised again and again and again. I mean, when does our practice when do we become lost? When do we become estranged from it?

When that Bodhi Mind has become lost and estranged. Remembering that everything we do affects everyone around us. Remembering not to put it off until it's too late. I was talking to my father recently who was got cancer and is dealing with a terminal illness and he's never really been involved in any kind of spiritual practice and he said, you know, if I was young again I think I would like to practice then.

I said, it has nothing to do with being young or old. I said, this is the perfect time. In fact, what I said was you couldn't have done it before. I don't think you weren't ready. You're ready now. Remembering that vow to attain it. As we constantly bump into the reality that it's unattainable, vowing to attain it.

Though there be the purity of the autumn waters extending to the horizon. That's our true nature. That's the nature of each one of us. When it's just the purity of the autumn waters, it's not yet realized its potential. We've not yet realized our potential.

How can it compare with the haziness of a spring night's moon?
