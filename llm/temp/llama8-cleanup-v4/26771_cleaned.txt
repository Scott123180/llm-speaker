Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:

Discovering the Footprints Along the riverbank, under the trees, I discover footprints. Even under the fragrant grass, I see his prints. Deep and remote mountains, they are found. These traces no more can be hidden than one's nose, looking heavenward.

Yesterday, Myotai gave a talk on the first stage of training. And as we agreed, I'm doing the second stage. These stages of training, it's important to understand, are kind of artificial in a sense. One teacher talking about them said, Something that is in reality, nothing, is organized into ten stages and commented on with many words. It's really just simply a way of giving some definition to something which is ultimately without definition, without any form.

And as Dada Shi has mentioned many times, normally, traditionally, a student would just come into training and begin and then just continue and go on and on and on, having no sense whatsoever of where they were until they were finished. And hundreds of years ago, these stages of training or the ox herding pictures, as they're depicted, came into existence. And there are different versions, one that has ten, the one that we use and has been the most lasting, another that used six, and I think a couple of others.

But really, it's a way of just helping students have a sense of progression, which, even though it can be a very deep pit that we fall into looking for progress, it can also be helpful. It can be a way of giving us a way of giving us a sense of accomplishment, of change, of development. And what the stages tend to do is, in a sense, describe something that we ultimately experience for ourselves.

So, in the beginning, when you go down there and look at those pictures and read the poems, it's poetry. But it begins to take on a whole nother meaning as we begin and then continue through our practice. Now, what Myotai spoke about yesterday was basically getting started, beginning, and what that involves. And one of the things she emphasized was not complicating what we're doing, not making it more complicated.

I was about to say that it already is. It's not complicated. It's not. It's basically very straightforward, very simple, very direct. And all of the complications and obstacles and barriers that we encounter along the way are not inherently part of the process, not inherently part of the path. It's something that we bring into it. And that, of course, is why people experience the practice differently, because we each bring different things into it, depending on karma, on our history, on age, on all kinds of things.

And whatever we bring into it is what we're going to encounter along the way. And the heavier that burden is, the harder it is going to be to let it go, the longer it may take to let it go. In a sense, it really doesn't matter, because once we begin, once we enter the path, the goal has been realized. The goal is being manifested as we practice. We will eventually come to see that, and that's important, but the fact remains the same.

And in that first stage, really what's happening is we're meeting ourselves for the first time, for most of us. For the first time, we're deliberately and consciously entering into something where what we encounter is ourself, what we encounter is who we are, and that that happens in a very naked kind of way. The problem in the beginning is that the mind doesn't allow us to see it yet, because it's so active, it's so busy.

It's like the door isn't open yet, and so we begin zazen. And really that's what's happening with zazen, is just clearing away some of the debris, so that we can just even get in, get the foot in, and begin to see what needs to be done. And one of the inevitabilities, I guess, about practice is that we begin not only with our own karmic load, our own baggage, whatever that may be, but we also begin with a whole inventory of ideas about what it is we're getting ready to begin.

And that is natural, in a sense. I mean, I don't think any of us come in here totally ignorant about the process. Almost everyone has read something, heard something. And all of that begins to fertilize a seed, which bears fruit when we enter into training, because at that point, what we're basically doing is practicing those ideas. We're practicing our imagination about what sin is.

As I was thinking about this, I was thinking about how powerful that is, and how powerful being, we talk about being romantic, having romantic ideas about the practice, and how difficult that can be, and how powerful. And as I was sitting there, I thought, well, what does romantic really mean? And I looked it up, and of course, it just means imaginary. It means something based on either imagination or an emotional kind of appeal.

And that's very much, for many of us, what this is in the beginning. And consequently, that's what we practice, because that's our understanding. And so it becomes imperative that we engage zazen, because that's the only thing that's going to cut through all of that and actually show us what's really happening, rather than what we think is.

It made me think of a moment a long time ago. I had done a master class with a very, very well-known concert pianist, and was hearing a performance of his that evening, and it was extraordinary, and the guy was unbelievable. And I was talking to someone afterwards, and they said, God, you know, he's so wonderful. I'd love to be able to do that.

And instantly, in my mind, what I saw was this man as a young boy coming home from school, and he's got his violin case, and he's walking up the stairs, and he's got his music, and he's got his practice, and he's got his dedication. And I thought, that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about.

And that's what we're doing here. We're not just sitting on a cushion, we're not just practicing a technique, we're not just trying to achieve some kind of spiritual state. We're actually, in a very real way, changing our lives. We're changing the way we see the world, we're changing the way we relate to others, we're changing the way we relate to ourselves.

And it's not easy. It's not easy to let go of our old ways of thinking, our old ways of being. It's not easy to take on this new way of life, this new way of being. But it's worth it. It's worth it because it's the only way we can truly be free.

Now, in the second stage of training, things start to get a little more complicated. We start to see the footprints of the ox, we start to see the traces of the self. And it's not just a matter of seeing them, it's a matter of understanding them, of making sense of them.

We start to realize that our old ways of thinking, our old ways of being, are not just obstacles to be overcome, but are actually the very things that are holding us back. We start to see that our attachment to our ego, our attachment to our identity, is what's keeping us from truly being free.

And it's a very confrontive time in our practice. It's a time of testing, when many very fundamental things that are required for practice are tested, are put to the test. We have to really, we are challenged to see what's driving us. All of those ideas and dreams and stories and tales that helped us in practice in the beginning that guided us, that informed what it was we were doing don't work anymore.

It's like we're running out of tricks. The things that we did in the beginning no longer work. And what tends to happen with us when we come into training is it's a bad analogy but it's kind of like being on a leash. And early on when students enter into training the leash is really long and it's kind of like that bag of tricks that we walk in with to a certain extent is okay, is allowed, will function.

What happens though as our commitment and our intention deepens is that that leash kind of gets pulled in and we begin to be held accountable for those things that have been informing our practice. So that in a sense this practice of ideas that was the beginning now becomes a practice of practice the practice of the self the practice of just moment to moment doing what we're now able to do in a different way because the mind will allow us that because we have learned how to allow the mind to do that.

And it's a very critical time because it can be a time when we stop because in a sense at this time our priorities are what will determine what we do. It's always been seemed kind of immensely ironic that we come into practice and we clearly say yes this is what I want to do. I want to engage this training. I want to forget the self. I want to forget the idea that I exist separate and distinct from the rest of the universe and I want help in that.

And then what we immediately do is we go out and we buy truckloads of brick and we start building up the wall to fortress ourselves against that from happening. So it's like this kind of push me, pull me kind of thing that begins where we're doing what we've said we want to do and we're fighting it. We're resisting it. We're challenging it.

But in a way, this moment is exactly what we've been preparing for all along. And the trap is, as Mirotai pointed out yesterday, that we tend to see the first stage as kind of what you have to do to get on to the real thing. And that's not true. Sitting in the first stage of training is exactly the same as the second stage and the third stage and the fourth stage. It's exactly the same. It's Azen.

The potential for forgetting the self is exactly the same if you're working with a breath or if you're sitting with Mu or doing Shikantaza. It's not different. And yet, working in a different way does put us in a position, does put us in a place where the potential tends to become more real.

And as our practice develops, we tend to enter into a state of mind where we can really begin to do what it is we've come out to do. Incredible that moment because we're warned about this from day one. We hear it all the time, practice is difficult. When people come into guardian council to petition to become students, we generally usually tell people pretty straightforwardly what to expect.

Yes, Dada, she is nice right now. He's very supportive. But that's not going to last. if you want to do what you're coming here to do. It's not going to last. And we always say, are you ready for this? And we've never yet heard anyone say, I don't think so. No, I don't want to do that. Of course, everyone says they're ready. I'm ready. I want that.

And yet, the gap between that and between being in the middle of it, it's no longer an idea. It's real. And the gap between that is sometimes unfathomable. It's so unfathomable that when it's happening, we don't realize it's happening, even intellectually. Even intellectually, sometimes we can't kind of extricate ourselves and say, oh yes, this is training, and this is what they've been telling me was going to happen.

We become blind. Because if it's really working, what's happening is that something's being taken away. And again, we're building our walls so that that doesn't happen. We want to give it up, but we don't want to give it up. We've asked this person to steal ourself from us, and we hate them for stealing that, for taking that precious thing away.

So one of the things that gets tested very deeply is being a student. And I don't mean being a formal student, I mean just being a student, hearing, trusting, practicing, just basic stuff, nothing high and lofty. And it tends to get harder to do that because the investment is deeper. We put in more time, we put in a lot of energy, and we're looking for something back. We want some yield.

And it can become more and more difficult to still be a student if we don't feel like we're getting back what we deserve. Sometimes being a student just begins with seeing that we're actually stuck. Sometimes we can't even see that. All we can see is that the world is crashing down, that there are too many demands, that something has gone wrong, that someone has gone wrong, and we just can't even see that we're just simply stuck.

That the practice is working beautifully, that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, that this is the moment we've been waiting for. We can't see it. And motivation becomes very important at that time. Why. If there's an alternative, we'll do that. If there's something better, something easier, something quicker, and the motivation isn't fundamental, then some time will come and we'll just shift.

And in a sense, that's okay. Our commitment gets tested, our determination. We've seen students who are very committed, who have great questioning, great doubt. They really want to know, but they just can't do it. They just can't work. They can't put their ass on the safo and sit. Trust.

Maybe I can't do this after all. Suddenly becomes a thought. Because there's a tension here. There's a tension that begins to build and develop. That's a tension between our grasp on reality and what we're beginning to see. The footprints, the traces of the ox.

So there's what we've led our life to believe all along is true, and then suddenly there's something else and it doesn't make sense. It's not we can't intellectualize it in a way that really works. And somehow there's a problem. And so we have to do something with that tension.

The thing we need to do is put it into practice. It's to put it into the heart. But sometimes that doubt, that confusion gets very, very strong. Maybe I can't do it. Maybe this isn't the practice for me.

You know what I mentioned yesterday? Maybe the practice is what isn't quite right. And one thing that we oftentimes start to do is look for guarantees. Because the stakes are getting higher and we want to know. Tell me if I do this, will I realize myself? There's no guarantee.

If I realize myself, will I make the right choices, do the right things? There's no guarantee. If I realize the precepts, will my life naturally, immediately, spontaneously, come out of those precepts? There's no guarantee. And what is that that we want? It's kind of crazy.

I mean, if you walked into practice and somebody said, okay, you're going to do this, and at a certain point, this is going to happen, and you're not really going to have any choice. And then another time, this is going to happen, and from that time on, your life is going to be this way, and you won't have any choice. That's not what we want. And that's not freedom.

Being free is being free to make a choice, to act, to make a mistake, to take a risk. Of course, practice, seeing the self, realizing the self, changes it. But there's no guarantee. Thank God.

We had a fellow call a couple weeks ago, last week, I think he was a college student at Vassar, doing a senior thesis on something like, I don't know, meditation around the world. It was some kind of outrageous thing, and he wanted to do part of it on Zen, and so we did a little phone interview.

And at the end of it, he said, well, tell me this, what has your practice done for your life? And I said, you know, I really hate this kind of question. I hate it because there's nothing I can say. There's nothing I can say that will answer that question. If we started now and went for the rest of time, I couldn't say it. What hasn't changed because of practice?

Practice. And he said, okay, okay, well then, what's the most important thing, the most powerful thing? This happened because of your practice. And before I knew it, I said responsibility. And I really have been thinking about that because my answer really took me by surprise.

And yet it's true. And that's what's happening here. That's what's happening in this time of practice is we're beginning to take responsibility. We have to begin to take responsibility for what we're doing. That's the only way it happens. And we take responsibility for all of it.

And that means that sometimes we fail, sometimes we succeed. And that's the reason the teacher is so important in this because the teacher is willing to take that risk. The teacher is willing to fail or succeed, to live or die so that we can realize ourselves. They're willing to do that long before we are.

They're willing to do that the day we walk in and say, I want to do it. From that point the teacher is ready and willing and waiting for the opportunity. Unfortunately all of this is making something that is really very straightforward complicated. It's making something which is very clean dirty.

We don't need to know about any of this. We don't need to understand any of it. We don't need to have heard any of it. It can help. It can hinder us. The only thing we have to do is abandon ourselves to it.

Years ago I was at a junction in my life where I was deciding what to do. It was a very scary time for me. The choice was basically whether to commit myself to becoming a professional musician. There were a lot of reasons why I shouldn't have done that. That's what made it frightening.

I was talking to a friend of mine who was a musician we were living in New York City. I was talking to him about it and he said as soon as you make the choice to do it at that instant things begin to change simply by virtue of having made the choice. I said I don't know. He said right. You don't know.

You can't see that until you've made that choice, until you've made that decision. Only then will you see things in that way. And he was absolutely right. Absolutely right. And that's absolutely the way this works.

It does not work being half in and half out. Half intent and half waiting, watching. We can practice that way. We may even see progress, but we can't take it to full distance. It takes everything. And all we have to do is make that decision. That we're going to do it.

And to then begin doing it. If we just do that, everything else takes care of itself. But it's just doing that that does come so uneasily. It's an incredible journey. For which we don't have to take anything. We have everything we need.

How long does it take? Depends on when we start. Depends on how we start. Depends on what happens the moment after we start and the moment after that. It's not safe. Trungpa Rinpoche said, it's better not even to begin because the danger of beginning is that if you get to the point where you see those footprints, where you see that there's something real, there's something to be had, and there's something to do, then how can you turn back?

We could. People do it. You can just forget about it. Forget about the outrageous claim. That it's possible to put an end to suffering. That it's possible to realize freedom. We can forget about that. Or maybe we can't.

Practice and verification. That's what's happening in stage two. That's what's happening in session. It's what's happening every single moment that we're practicing. It's exactly that. Practice and verification. Practice and verification. Seeing. Not the Buddha's words. Not the words of Rinzai, Dogen, Dado Sensei. Your words. Your mind.

It's real. It's real. It's extraordinary to be in this place, in this time. To be somewhere where it's just there. All we have to do is reach. It's not easy, but it is. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy. It's easy.
