Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:


the morning is full of the cloud gate on all sides I see his waste of fog who can say if that sound echoing is bell or bird our desire rests so snug and sure in these vast arms of transparent stone this morning because many of the residents seem to be living in a kind of murky January post-strohatsu December fog funk

I thought we would enter the cloud gate cloud gate is actually the name of Master Unman that's his mountain name and his personal name when he became a teacher taking the name of the mountain and on all sides I see his waste of fog waste as in the body fog is actually a phrase from a poem by Pablo Neruda that points in a sense to the ungraspability of all that surrounds us and what is surrounded why is it ungraspable becomes the question

it's easy to answer because it's not outside it's not other than us how does the hand grasp itself how does the eye see itself but the cloud gate koans of Master Unman ask us to do more than just rest in some pretty phrases so today's koan is one that's familiar to many of us it's the koan that's actually used as a prerequisite for someone becoming ordained in the mountains and rivers in order to enter monastic training as a life vow one has to engage and realize this koan bell sound in priest's robe

it's called Unman said look this world is vast and wide why when the bell rings do you put on your priest's robe Master Unman is one of my favorite of the Zen masters that we encounter in Zen training he's considered by many one of the last great geniuses of Zen I don't know if there were minor geniuses that followed or why they're often assumed to have stopped but that's often you'll see in the writings one of the last great Zen teachers and he lived from 864 to 949 and he's known for his passion it was a kick your feet out from under you take it all away everything you're assuming everything that's stopping you put it on the line drop it give it all

and he's known also for his keenness of wit and the sharpness of his intellect so in addition to being kind of a physical teacher a full body teacher he also utilized the full scope of human intellect and humor in his teaching which makes him a good January teacher as well seems to be one of the things that gets forgotten often by those surviving January rather than practicing it that we must laugh at ourselves and Unman tends to encourage that rather vitally but he doesn't do it in a trite way

one of the comments about his teaching that I love is when read when you read his words and you can feel the passion in them it's described as when read they scorch your eyeballs heard they just make your ears drop off so in other words beware watch out Mr. Unman's teachers in a sense set him up to be this kind of a dynamo and it's especially to the residents I wanted to mention one of the factors that contributed to Unman's teaching style was that his first teacher was an absolute rebel he did the whole shtick he did monastic training he was the head monk in this monastery where Rinzai trained under Huang Po and then he was done with that he quit monasticism he quit being a monk he dropped all the forms and just did what he needed to do

and the word that's often used in the descriptions of him is flinty you know it's like it's hard to bump into this guy but when you do there's a spark and when Unman did there was a definite spark and there was actually a crunching of bones this is the teacher that for those of you who are familiar with the story when Unman got to the place where this guy was trying to just live his life and peace and you know receive as necessary give as necessary there was always a line wanting to go into the room with him to see if that spark could be ignited in one's own heart and mind and Unman finally got to the door and the story that's often told is about him being repeatedly sent away by Mu Chao until finally he is being dismissed and he sticks his leg in the door and Mu Chao just slams it full out and as Unman's leg is sorely crunched he realizes the nature of the universe in himself and goes forth fully sparked and free

and there's always the caveat this is not the only way but taking full advantage of whatever the situation is the teacher teaches but you get a sense of part of what Unman dealt with what made him the teacher he became he was not permanently crippled by his training as most of us are not but it often feels like it might he walked on and found his next teacher to further refine his understanding with who was the fifth in the lineage of Shittau who many are familiar with and was also regarded as kind of a tough old bird so Unman went on to become known as a teacher that was kind of the nuts and bolts teacher rather than the kind obvious feeding and nourishing of students he would feed by taking away and nourish by insisting on self-reliance self-realization so he wasn't an easy guy and yet his heart was unmistakable

one of the teachings of Unman I wanted to read and we're also very lucky with Unman's teachings because there were very good records kept and so you get a lot of the very vital picture of those who crowded around him and how their training happened one of Unman's teachings says in reality and as you hear his teaching it's important to hear alive where is he talking about in reality there's not the slightest thing that could be the source of understanding or doubt for you rather you have the one thing that matters each and every one of you it's the great fun it's great function manifests without the slightest effort on your part you're no different from the ancestor Buddha's but since the root of your faith has always been shallow and the influence of your selfish actions massive you find yourselves all of a sudden wearing many horns

that's an expression used in Buddhism like finding yourself deep in the weeds finding yourself with horns growing out of your heads when you're an animal that doesn't need horns you're in a deluded way hiding yourself from what's real acting in a way that's inappropriate and needlessly awkward you're heavy headed and bumping into things suddenly wearing many horns you're carrying your bowl bags far and wide these are the begging bowls that a monk carries you're carrying your bowl bags your few possessions far and wide through thousands of villages and myriads of hamlets what's the point of so victimizing yourself is there something you're lacking which one of you full-fledged fellows hasn't got his share though you may accept what I'm saying for yourself you're still in bad shape there's more required than just believing this

you must neither fall for the tricks of others nor simply accept their directives the instant you see an old monk open her mouth you tend to stuff those big rocks right into yours and when you cluster in little groups to discuss the words you're exactly like those green flies on shit that struggle back to back to gobble it all up what a shame the old masters could not help using up their whole lifetime for the sake of you all so they dropped a word here and half a phrase there to give you a hint you may have understood these things put them aside and make some effort for yourselves and you will certainly become a bit familiar with them

I love that it's not that you will astonish the heaven and shake the earth and realize the end to all suffering and flowers will flow out of the palms of your hands but you may become familiar a bit with this reading hurry up hurry up time doesn't wait for anyone and breathing out is no guarantee for breathing in again or do you have a spare body and mind to fritter away you absolutely must pay close attention take care so this kind of nuts and bolts kick your butt teacher also has a few sweet morsels as well it's not abusive in the sense that many people often misconstrues in it's just right to the bone take care hurry up unless you happen to have a spare

the gritter away that phrase that's often used in literature that describes the nourishing grandmother aspect as a grandmother always confused me because my background was very different my grandfather was the one whose eyes were always twinkling and would give me as much time as the universe had he was actually a clockmaker and he would take apart clocks and took me up in a big clock in halifax to show me what a minute looked like on a cog and just was never short of time or love or giving whereas my grandmother was much more the other way of bringing someone into the world and what it takes to live anything you'd say around my grandmother you were liable to get the response now why do you think that what does that got to do

and in Unmon in a sense we get that combination of the mother and the father very much alive and we also get a sense to see in this part of what's evident in any really great spiritual teacher when he says the old masters could not help using up their whole lifetime for the sake of you it really brought to my mind the image that's been on the news lately of Mother Teresa in the hospital what is she 205 or something which is like oh and it's given so exhaustively and she's you know often quoted in these stories as kind of telling the doctors who are saying sorry your kidneys don't work and your lungs don't work and your heart's broken and your blood isn't good you know not sure the blinking mechanism will continue to function tomorrow and she's kind of like I've got an ordination I've got to get back to you know she's got work to do she's got life to give she's not seeing the shortages she's using up her whole lifetime

so here we are with our koan look the world is vast and wide why and that's the first point people often go directly to why are you doing this why are you doing that but there's a reason that phrase is included as the first point you go on the world is big each moment is complete instantly new changing there's no way to see the end anything is possible the world the universe by definition has no end your relationship to it can't be defined in terms of limit the world is vast unbounded for us unbounded and to enter the koan is in a sense to be pressed to see that wideness to acknowledge personally not as a theoretical exercise but is that true as my grandmother would say why would you say that what is the universe what is this world that's so vast where is it where is this in reality

that he began that other teaching and in order to even begin to get a direct sense of that we're required to see who's looking to not simply and habitually fix where we are and who we are and what this is what is any bit of it and if that's too cosmic a question we tend to not really engage you is there a habitual way of seeing understanding knowing that that you use to learn is it true what you usually tell yourself in response to that is it in reality what is this daida she in his zen of seeing retreats go off and take one of these photographs that's you know just blocks of color bits of texture light color and ask the participant to see it enter some part of it that they're drawn to to feel what they're feeling rather than look at it and go oh that's an old mailbox leaning towards the dirt path on a country road in August to really see and not know it in advance what is a mailbox what is purple what is anything

and to begin to open to the what happens when we don't do that and it sometimes really gets to me a lot of the ways that zen stories are repeated in literature now enrages me and I just feel so frustrated it's like I want to take off my robes and skulk away and never use the word zen again because anyone would bother with real spiritual practice it's just another set of rules and a change of clothing and some interesting stories and so you hear and one of the ones that was so poignant was the pursued person enjoying the woods rain on the pine needles dropping just being in that space walking breathing crunching whatever just being there and suddenly there's danger there's someone after her gang of God pursuing and she races looking for safety she does what she can to fight she uses what's around and it's clear that the best option is to run like hell and she runs like hell until she comes to a cliff edge and the only way to proceed is to go down the cliff edge and she's down there hanging from a bit of corded root without much strength left pursuers taunting her

when she notices that down below her the only other way is a hungry bunch of animals tigers bears lions and tigers and bears she's like what am I supposed to do now and then she says I'll just take care of myself be myself take care of the suffering of all sentient beings it's not other than take care of yourself but if that seems too large if the world seems too vast and just start the vast arms of the transparent poem hymn hymn o' hymn hymn ない 度 痴
