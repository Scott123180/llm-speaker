Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:

So welcome to part two of the three pillars of practice. Today we're going to do the great faith koan. And I wanted first to read from the Faith Mind Sutra, the beginning lines. The great way is not difficult. It only avoids picking and choosing. When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth, then hold no opinion for or against anything. To set up what you like against what you dislike is a disease of the mind.

When the deep meaning of things is not understood, the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail. The way is perfect like vast space, where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess. Indeed, it's due to our choosing to accept or reject that we don't see the true nature of things. Live neither in the entanglements of outer things nor in inner feelings of emptiness. Be serene in the oneness of things, and such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.

To deny the reality of things is to miss their reality. To assert the emptiness of things is to miss their reality. The more you talk and think about it, the farther astray you wander from the truth. Stop talking and thinking, and there's nothing that you'll not be able to know. And on that note, I'm going to talk about it for a while.

When we decided to do this series that Daito was going to be gone for three days, and there were three of us doing the session, and we'd do the three pillars of practice, as Yasutani Roshi outlined, no one jumped at great faith. I think there's a kind of quiet quality to great faith, whereas great doubt has this kind of cavernous, screaming drama to it. And at least to me, great determination is kind of this fang-toothed, bloody-eyed, I'll-do-it-dammit, you know, fierceness. Whereas great faith has kind of this fluffy pillar quality to it.

And I thought it would be a good challenge for me to kind of go into that and see what's there that I've not appreciated before. In a sense, it is so intimate, and we use that word so much that it tends to get lost in our hearts. But it is so close that faith is almost impossible to talk about. And because of that, I'm going to tell a fish story. It's one of the ancient teaching stories, and it always seemed very much like Zen training at this monastery to me, because there's this young, very philosophical fish who turns to another fish in philosophy class and says, you know, I hear so much about this water, this ocean that we live in, this, I guess it's kind of their ground of being, their water of being. I would love to meet this water, know this ocean.

And the other philosophical fish go, oh, yes, that would be very interesting. And they go to the old sage, Tuna Fish, who says to them, we are all of one ocean. There is no other ocean than this. We are born ocean. We live ocean. We die ocean. And the fish, the young philosophical fish, now have a philosophy to go with, and they have faith in it, and they believe it. And this is a lot like the talking Zen that we all get into in the first few years of Zen training. We can say it all and believe it beautifully, because it's nice. We are all of one water. We are all of the same stuff, different yet the same.

And on occasions when we're pressed to say what we believe, we may come out with this kind of stuff. Well, there's no self. All things are one. And, you know, and you do your Zen rap. And this is fish faith and not great faith. And the only place I've ever seen great faith at all done visually was in the New Yorker cartoon that Sensei's spoken of many times, in which, I don't know if they're the same fish or different fish, but there are two fish leaping out of the water. And one turns to the other and says, see, that's what I was telling you about.

And this reminds me of an expression of Dogen's that he uses very frequently and very vibrantly, which is emptiness leaping out of itself. And it kind of embodies that intrinsic contradiction of how can you see yourself? You're the one doing the seeing. And in the sutra that I just read, I encountered that same kind of dilemma on the part of the translators. And it was interesting to see how different ones of them dealt with it. The whole sutra is about non-duality. That's its point, if there is a point.

It expressed itself even in the title. Some of the translators would call it the Faith in Mind Sutra, which is a definite interpretation. Others would call it the Faith Mind Sutra. They couldn't take it apart. But when you look at that Faith in Mind for just a moment, you encounter that same kind of what's-going-on-here feeling to just ask, whose faith? In whose mind? If it's mind's faith in mind, then it has a kind of internal redundancy. And what's going on there? What does it mean to see into your own nature, to see into your own mind?

And it's very difficult to talk about it. It requires a leap of a sort. And that's Dogen's leaping out of oneself, out of emptiness. It is impossible. And that's our job. But this is all kind of airy talk. I know that, as I see many of you fade away as I start talking about internal contradictions. And that's not what this talk will be about.

For me, it started coming up, it's more the grit bones of the great faith koan that Daito-shi earlier in the week was talking about when he was saying, you know, I say, practice with your whole body and mind and it becomes abstruse to people. What I mean is practice with your life, with your junk, with your stuff, with what's going on for you. And it occurred to me that the grit bones, great faith koan is one I've heard expressed so many times and done myself over and over and over again.

And it goes something like, if the instruction is to trust myself, that's my resource. It's to constantly be thrown back on myself. And myself is this deluded, stupid, selfish, weird thing. How will I ever find this great way that's beyond picking and choosing? It doesn't, I don't, what do I, and you get into that. And you find that you're constantly questioning, like Gion was saying yesterday, the kind of the source of your own motivation, the source of your own actions, what's underneath, the underneath, the underneath, of why you do, what you do, when you do, how you do.

And it's very easy to become stymied. And the leap practice becomes necessary. Because it's not about knowing. And it's not something that can be figured out. And if you go to the Zen master, if that's your avenue of resources, and you do this great faith koan in front of him, and you say, I don't understand how to do it. What, what, you know, I don't have what it takes. I, my life is so confused. I'm not very smart. I'm not really a, kind of a spiritual whiz kid. And I don't understand your dharma talks. I don't, I, you know, I, I really feel lost.

And he'll, in the midst of your drama, say, trust yourself. Which starts you again with, what do you mean, trust myself? Myself, you told me, didn't exist. And here you are, I'm supposed to trust it. And you get in this loop. And it's very dramatic and very painful. And it recurs periodically. And it's basically coming from the same point that this sutra started with of no choice, no picking and choosing. How do you get out of the loop of picking and choosing?

And the monk who long ago asked that of Joshu experienced a kind of leap that is interesting to look at when he said to his teacher, what is it to not pick or choose? How do you get outside a choice? How do you really make that leap? And Joshu said, between heaven and earth, I alone am the Holy One. He swallowed it all up. It was just him. Nothing outside. He could only nod to himself, as the phrase goes. It was no, it was no one else's problem, as Sensei said the other day in his talk.

But the monk didn't leap with him. Stood outside of it. And from standing outside of it, that's choosing. And so the monk says, well that's a choice. That was, you just chose to say I alone. I mean, what do you mean? That's choosing. And Joshu turns to him and says, asshole, where's the picking and choosing? Where's the choice? He flips it around. He says, I'm both one, alone between heaven and earth, and I'm duality. You're over there, you're an asshole.

And he does it to shock, to shake the monk up. That switching back and forth, that ability to walk in both sides at once, is a place of freedom that only comes through that deep faith. I'm not going to go in any great depth into the koan. It's only given as an example of the frequency of the question and the way that the response can reveal the way out of that loop. How do you get out of the loop? Of this and that, of up and down, of me and you, of I don't know what to do.

It's all so complicated and I am not enough to choose. I alone, I'm the only one. It all comes back to this spot. And in this spot, in this one place that contains everything, it also contains choice. It's neither choice nor not choice. But that can get very intellectual. The question is how to do it, how to begin to even deal with the question. And that's what we usually carry in or carry around when we're in that muddle of great doubt and the great faith that arises with it.

And that's something that I think often goes unrecognized. I know on, on my part, when I came into training, I was very conscious of doubt. That fanged place was the way I walked around. I didn't understand. I was angry is not the word. But very much aware that things were not working. Not so aware that just the fact of deciding to practice was an act of great faith, was a leap that made all the difference in the world.

The rareness of that in the world is something that I think we also need to appreciate among those who make the commitment to practice so that we can appreciate one another better. There's a phrase in Dogen's writings where he's talking about the necessities for those who will receive a monastic education similar to the three pillars of faith. But he says that the first one is that those who have the thought of enlightenment, those who've allowed it to come up, come forward, and when there's that, regardless of intellectual ability or anything else, there's the possible probability of authentic practice, just the thought, just the fact that it comes up is enough, contains the whole spectrum of what practice can be, of what enlightenment can be.

And that was very moving to me because it was much easier for me to admit that I could have that thought than it was to imagine possibly being able to do something called attain realization, which didn't make much sense, considering my limited resources. It also, in his requirements, mentions the necessity that those who undertake monastic education or Zen training have the willingness to let go of personal satisfactions in order to serve others, which was something I'd never seen phrased before in Zen.

It sounded more like a Christian ideal in some way, and yet it was also very obvious when you looked at what a Zen student does in terms of letting themselves be made uncomfortable, whether you call it serving others or serving yourself and getting yourself out of misery. There's inevitably an element of service intrinsic to it, that you're not simply eating, sleeping, and drinking your way to death. There's a movement, a direction towards freedom and that movement can eventually become a vow, and that vow, which is so evident here, is enough to break open the sky.

It began to occur to me when I was kind of letting deep faith mull around in my horror as a talk topic that one of the things that many of us share is an intolerance or a dislike for that kind of fish faith or the false faith that is very prevalent in the world. It is very difficult to describe the difference between someone who is really living out of deep faith and one who's not.

It was obvious to me recently in Arlington when I went to my dad's funeral. And there was a wonderful ceremony going on. An honor guard firing guns and folding flags and doing all of this fal-de-rah ritual which was very powerful. It came to a point in the ceremony where the base chaplain was to speak and he had on all the religious stuff, the white gloves and the uniform and the shiny shoes and the band across his chest and he read from the Bible and he read beautiful words.

It was very much about letting go and a teaching and leading a good life. But in his eyes and in his presence you could feel nothing but fear and discomfort and I felt so sad for him to have this job where day after day, hour after hour, people came in states of grief and turned to him and he was frightened. And I wasn't going to talk about this but I guess because I've brought it up, I'll mention because so many of the sangha did reach out to me when my dad died that one of the things that was most surprising to me about this period of time was the intensity of the emotion that I felt.

And I mentioned it to Dido Sensei and he said, well, you're not used to it. And I said, no, I'm not. And he said, well, that's okay. It's a good thing. And I thought, yeah, it is. It's a good thing. And I think that's one of the things that we often miss in our practice, is the intensity of the emotion. We're so used to being numb, or being detached, or being in some way not fully present, that when we do come across something that really touches us, it's like, wow.

And I think that's one of the things that great faith is about, is being willing to be touched, being willing to be moved, being willing to be affected by the world around us. And it's not just about being affected by the world around us, it's also about being affected by our own lives. It's about being willing to look at ourselves, to look at our own emotions, to look at our own thoughts, and to see where we're stuck, where we're numb, where we're not fully present.

And I think that's one of the things that's so beautiful about this practice, is that it's not just about achieving some kind of state or some kind of goal, it's about being willing to be with ourselves, to be with our own lives, in all of their complexity and all of their beauty. And I think that's what great faith is about, is being willing to be with ourselves, to be with our own lives, in all of their complexity and all of their beauty.

When Yasutani Roshi first talked about these pillars of faith, he did his number on faith itself. Three pillars of practice, he did his number on faith and one of the students in the room said, so basically great faith is just believing like everything as it is is Buddha nature right like the willow is green and the carnation is red and you're tall and I'm small right and Yasutani said, yeah.

He explained he didn't really present an answer to her but he did come back and he said, you know isn't that absurd isn't the fallacy of that self-evident if you don't in that faith also question why is there greed why is there conflict if all things are perfect and complete lacking nothing why is there conflict how does that arise and that faith and doubt working together you don't ask the question if you don't somehow feel there is a question you just accept shit happens and that's the way it's supposed to be and I'm part of it and so I'm shit and forget it.

And you may curl up in a ball or you may create more of it if there's anything subtly operating that tells you there's another way to live then great faith is operating and that's kind of the mutual co-arising of the two together. The thing that Mizumi Roshi said about great faith that I liked was that great faith functions as a steering wheel for determination that if you simply let determination be the foot on the gas pedal you just go all over the place banging into things unless there's some sensibility that what this is about is enlightenment and that that informs the beginning of your practice then it just bangs around.

What I see this breakdown into in the zendo and in our training is basically a sense of courage and attentiveness that every moment is important and every moment is the koan so that regardless of what's coming up whether your knee is breaking or your koan is stupid or the windows open and your neck is cold it's your life and that faith empowers what you do it is your koan it comes home to you.

One of the problems with fish faith or the kind of fluffy faith is that it leaves you the option to say if my life were different then I would practice if I only had a better body and that didn't keep breaking if I only lived in a warmer climate then I would really sit strong. Great faith kind of swallows that up and it's a very simple ordinary thing we often rebel against the word faith because it sounds kind of special and very religious.

And I've heard examples given of well you have faith in turning on the electric switch that the light will come on you don't think about it you just do it and in a very simplified slightly off way that's the action of great faith but it's more subtle than that and we all know that because it takes that very minute giving to your practice of everything of the pain and the joy else elsewhere in the faith mind sutra so zan says to live in this faith is the road to the non dual because the non dual is one with a trusting mind.

Let's this last evening of session explore that trusting mind together. When you trust yourself when I trust myself that swallows the whole universe that is standing alone whether we realize it or not trusting the moment trusting our practice I don't have any magic up here I don't even have much force today and I apologize for that but I do have great faith that together with this trusting mind the Buddha way and our lives can't be split apart.

I think that I shouldn't talk much more but I'd like to encourage everyone here to use this last bit of time to really trust it. One of the things we tend to do on the last day is vacillate between feeling I'm really going to eke everything out of this time nothing will stop me and seeing well it's almost over I'll go to bed early. It's a real important time to trust your capabilities there's nothing any of us lacks if it were a party after a long hard week none of us would bat an eye if it were a good party to stay up till one or two in the morning we'd enjoy it we'd take it as our right our payoff this night is the party and we can do it we can go so deep into ourselves on this last day please let's trust each other and what we can do.
