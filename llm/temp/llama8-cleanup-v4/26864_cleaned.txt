the book of equanimity case for world-honored one points to the ground preface to the assembly as soon as a single moat of dust arises the whole earth is contained therein with a single horse in a single land the land is extended who is this person that can be master in any place and meet the source in everything

the main case as the world-honored one was walking with the congregation he pointed to the ground with his finger and said this spot is good to build the sanctuary Indra Emperor of the gods took a blade of grass stuck it in the ground and said the sanctuary is built the world-honored one smiled the verse the boundless spring on the hundred plants picking up what comes to hand he uses it knowingly the 16-foot tall golden body a collection of virtuous qualities casually leads him by the hand into the red dust able to master in the dusts from outside creation the guest shows up everywhere life is sufficient in its way no matter if one is not clever as clever as others this corn kind of found me I I'm not quite sure where I'm going to go with it yet although I have some sense of it and the first thing I wanted to point to and say something about is in the preface to the assembly well there are three sentences in there soon soon as a single moat of dust arises the whole earth is contained therein and that we've heard before that even in a speck of dust the ten thousand things reside complete and that's of course the diamond net of Indra the total interpenetration of all things from the most gigantic to the tiniest completely coexisting interpenetrated mutual causality you affect one and you affect the totality of the universe then the second line with a single horse and a single lance the lands extended a lot of these phrases come up in these Chinese collections China was a land that there was just continual battles and I think the three or four classes of people were the merchants the generals the scholars and the monks and then of course the Emperor and so a lot of what people read a lot of what they heard a lot of what they talked about was about war in generals and I think it's about time we put an end to that shit and not translate it into English into English as our example these are just examples of single actions and the results of it I'd prefer for example because of a single wire the whole city is in darkness and I think that has a multiplicity of ways of seeing it a single seed and the plum trees fragrance fills the ten erections who is this person who is this person who can master who can be master in any place and meet the source in everything who indeed as the world honored one was walking with this congregation he pointed to the ground with his finger and said this spot is good to build a monastery in an Indra emperor of the gods took a blade of grass stuck it in the ground and said the monastery in the ground and said the monastery is built the world on it once smiled and some of you are familiar with the use of the blade of grass in several different places in the sutras Buddha once asked Manjushri to please find him something that was not medicine in the whole universe Manjushri said he couldn't find anything that wasn't medicine everything was medicine so Buddha says then bring me something that is medicine and Manjushri brought a blade picked up a blade of grass and handed it to him the Buddha held up that blade of grass and said this is the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha the Buddha manifested in a pile of shit and rubbish Dogen asks the chief cook of his monastery to be able to manifest the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha with a cabbage leaf the sixteen foot golden body of the Buddha is the physical body of the Buddha manifested in the phenomenal world in other words the teachings of wisdom and compassion in this life in this world of phenomena among the ten thousand things amid the pain and the grief the suffering the war and the peace the joy the peacefulness some of you may remember the living room discussion of the Pong family they were all sitting around the living room and those of you that don't know the Pongs the Pongs lived during the Tang dynasty layman Pong studied with Master Basso and succeeded him although he never became a monk remained a layman his wife was also enlightened and had studied with Passo and several of the other masters and their daughter is said to be the clearest of the three of them they also had a son but he wasn't into Buddhism so there's not much is known about him but the three of them were sitting around the living room one day having you know everyday conversation that families have and Laman Pong got up off the couch and said difficult difficult difficult like finding a needle in a pile of millet seed and his wife got up from her chair and said easy easy easy easy like the feet touching the ground when getting up from bed and the daughter said neither difficult nor easy the ancestors meaning on the tips of a hundred thousand grasses of course the layman showed one side the mother showed the other side and the daughter showed the total merging of both that was neither this week this past this month and the month that's coming there are several things that have been going on one is that have all kind of been running through my head as I was working with this the diamond net of Indra classes that we did a couple weekends ago the eight gates workshop that was that was I think a week ago I lost track of what was when teachings of the insentient that are going to be happening this coming weekend the white plum meeting that's going to happen in Japan well I'm gone for a couple of weeks there are a lot of things that are happening there that it's so karmically related to to this sangha and to what's going on here in the country the white plum of course is the original white plum and school in the white plum of course is Milyansian L.A. And out of that lineage came we're now in the so Roshi was the first generation second generation third generation there's third generation already from that in the past 25 years that happened also I'm going to be visiting Sedo Sedo Sa's temple and the purpose of the visit is to dedicate his temple it's very old maybe 500 years old it's been there for a long time but it's never had a zendo in 500 years people don't do zazen didn't do zazen there and Sedo's visit to this country like Dosho's visit to this country before him Dosho spent two years here practicing with us and Sedo spent two years practicing with us and both of them were incredible teachers for this sangha both of them were totally incredibly nourished by this sangha and in turn nourished them I mean we talk about examples of ultimate in work practice both of them were extraordinary and in their zazen they were extraordinary and just their being they were extraordinary but they both learned something very powerful they learned about lay practitioners they never knew about lay practitioners in Japan lay practitioners don't sit monks don't sit they went back to their respective temples and each of them built a Western style zendo not even not even their kind of zendo but a Western style zendo which altar at one end of the room and sitting on the floor with rows of things usually they have raised tans with the altar in the center cowboys then they brought back and he's he's having an opening he's got priests from all over Japan coming and his intent is to reach out the lay practitioners in Japan and encourage them to come and practice there we'll be doing an exchange program where students go there and those students come here also so that's pretty significant that's the result of the karma of of this place of this mountain of this sangha the people here so Bayan Hakujin sent it out it rattled around and now it's gone back and it's going to spread there just as it's spreading here so it's a very auspicious kind of thing and of course we're also going to visit the head temples Dogen's temple of Ehiji and Kezan Sojiji and Soen Roshi's grave who was my first teacher and a real reconnection with a lot of the karmic links and an opportunity to appreciate what those teachers did I mean you know there's no big bucks in it doing it this way in this country coming here I mean Mizumi Roshi's brothers are very very wealthy he's a pauper pauper by comparison he could be doing what they're doing but he chose to bring the Dharma to America and to stay here and to teach here and to die here he's an American citizen now so that's important it's coming up born as the Earth series that's happening the video that we're doing on World Peace and Harmony the art project Spine of the Goddess also kept coming up as I looked at all these things and this sanctuary that's being built here by Indra with the blade of grass what was he pointing to what is the sanctuary and at one of the first-generation teachers' meetings one of the teachers there was telling the group how he used the blade of grass in his teaching and I said well that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the fact that the blade of grass can kill or give life it depends on how we use it and that's what the teachings of the insentient are all about it's not just the gurgle of the valley stream it's the hum of the vacuum cleaner too some wonderful things can be possible when the insentient are used skillfully but our tendency is to use them greedily and unskillfully our tendency is to let money dominate moral and ethical values and that's what screws it up this assistant that was here with Alan Ginsberg told me an incredible story incredible story Graham Nash I don't know many of you youngins know Graham Nash from Crosby Stills Nash & Young well Graham Nash is an extraordinary human being he's not just a singer and if you've ever listened to him talk and if you've ever listened to the words of his music you see what an extraordinary being he is and recently he's had a TV show where he's the host and he interviews people it's just incredible what he was putting on there and also the work that he did for his buddy one of the band members who was really almost killed himself with drugs and how he was part of getting him rehabilitated and out of prison and so on he interviewed him on the program but anyway Graham grew up in England and his father was a photographer and the dark room was in his bedroom so from the time he was a little kid he watched his father develop pictures and he developed a real interest in photography so he became a collector of course he made a lot of money as a musician and he invested it in photographs and finally he had thousands and thousands of photographs and his house was filled with it and his wife finally had it she didn't want them around the house anymore so he sold this collection for I don't know how much 10 15 million dollars or something it was an enormous collection he took the money you have to have already had exhibits before they'll exhibit you of course nobody wants to be the first one to give you the exhibit so you know new photographers new artists have a hard time getting started and then he endowed a few colleges for art education and so on but the biggest thing he did is he bought this gigantic computer that can digitize images and this enormous 40,000 I'm sorry 250,000 Jet Ink Printer huge that prints huge sheets you know mural size and he can produce images photographic images as perfect as a photographing emulsion no silver none of the toxins none of the chemicals some of the most obnoxious chemicals on the face of this earth that are totally destructive to the environment are in the process of photographic processing and the silver compounds that go into the emulsion it's one of the great guilt trips that I've had at doing that when I had my own photographic laboratory I used to do this excessive neutralization and chromatography absorption columns so that I wouldn't be sending that stuff down into the sewers and into the Hudson River and down into the ocean but still there it is I mean it's still toxic some of it can be recovered but and it's very costly and but it continues and why does it continue guess I mean Eastman Kodak's enormous and it's endowed a college a university it would be very difficult to do anything about it but this machine will produce perfect photographic prints with a full scale of tones and it will do it in color and it will do it in black and white and color chemicals that are in color even worse that's only half the story one of the things that this guy didn't mention to me is that the next obvious thing is a camera that will make the photograph that doesn't have to go on a piece of film see what they're doing right now is they're taking the film making a print digitizing it putting it on a computer and then making the prints from that so they're saving all of the silvering chemicals from the printing process but it's still involved in the original negative but a camera can be made it's just a computer a little piece of a computer that will make an image that will not destroy the environment that will be imperfect of paper paper and carbon is what will be involved in it it's just an incredible possibility using it knowingly using it in a self-centered way without any consideration for the rest of the universe without any consideration for a neighbor that's in disharmony with the universe that's what creates pain and suffering that's what creates wars how to create harmony and we do it we do it when we push somebody on a bus we do it when we're impatient and honk honk honk the horn when the traffic's not moving we do it when we're noisy in a library where somebody else is trying to study yet we come to the monastery and everybody bows to each other and we're very nice to each other and the minute we walk out the gate it starts in you know when we dig out and hit that highway behind that 200 horsepower and nobody gets in our way all of these devices can kill or give life just like that blade of grass can kill or give life it depends on how we use it it depends on how knowingly we use it and when you realize that this great earth and everything in it is nothing but yourself and that what you do to all of it every bit of it you do to yourself then your way of dealing with the 10,000 things a way of dealing with each other is completely transformed everything is the same nothing's going to get wonderful because you realize yourself but what will happen is you will be able to function in a way that is at peace in harmony with the 10,000 things and by doing that you'll be in peace and harmony with yourself there's a lot to be said for right livelihood how you make your living makes a big difference in how you feel about yourself it's a tremendous change that happens when you feel that what your actions are doing are nourishing somebody rather than poisoning somebody or hurting somebody picking up what comes to hand he uses it knowingly the 16 foot Golden body of the Buddha a collection of virtuous qualities casually leading by the hand into the red dust and the red dust is the pain and confusion red dust is the pollution the red dust is war the red dust is greed anger and ignorance able to master able to be master in the dust how do you master the dust that's the manifestation of the 10,000 hands and arms and eyes of Kannon Bodhisattva that's the great heart of compassion it's there I mean if it's in my computer it must be in you right but you got to realize it I realize it I see it's in you but unless you realize it you won't use it you won't manifest it you'll just manifest your life out of the program out of habit out of conditioning out of what you've been told what you've been what you heard rather than what you've experienced of your own being in your own life from outside creation a guest shows up from outside of creation beyond creation unborn everywhere life is sufficient in its way somehow we always find it lacking we always find ourselves lacking and yet it's abundant it's abundant it's abundant it's abundant in all sorts of things it's abundant in evil and it's abundant in good and it's abundant in that which is neither good nor evil moon in the dew drop formless form in a single chip computer chip everywhere everywhere life life is sufficient in its own way pain and joy notwithstanding everywhere the marvelous mind of nirvana endlessly teaching do you hear it do you see it do you feel it if so then that's the place of entry right there you enter the way
