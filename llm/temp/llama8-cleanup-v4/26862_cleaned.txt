Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:

The Book of Equanimity, Case 33, Sun Cheng's Golden Fish, Preface to the Assembly. Meeting the strong, be weak. Meeting the soft, be hard. If both are hard and hit each other, there will surely be one damaged. But tell me, how do you interchange the main case? Sun Cheng asked Xuefeng, the golden fish that's passed through the net, what does it use for food?

Xuan Feng said, when you come out of the net, I'll tell you. Xuan Cheng said, the teacher of 1,500 people and yet you don't even know a saying? Xuan Feng said, my tasks as abbot are many.

The verse. When first ascending the tears of waves, clouds and thunder accompany. Leaping up magnificently, look at the great function. With burnt tail, he clearly crosses the gate of you. The beautiful fish won't agree to be sunk in a pickle jar. An old, mature man does not startle the crowd. Someone used to facing great adversary has no fear from the start.

Floating, floating, just as light as five ounces. Massive, massive, heavier than even a thousand tons. San Cheng's, exalted fame over the four seas. Who again was his peer? Shen Feng stands alone. The eight winds blowing do not move him.

We're in our third full day of Se Shin now. Third day on is part of Se Shin. It gets lighter and lighter. After all the extra begins to fall away. It's reminded me of, I think it was Michelangelo, who said that, when asked about his sculpture, creating his sculpture, and he said he doesn't create it. He just exposes the image that's already inside the stone right from the beginning. He discovers the image. She chips away the extra that hides the image.

Se Shin are about. In the beginning of Se Shin is all that turmoil that we usually bring to it. Little by little each day, the stuff falls away. In the beginning, we get closer and closer to that image inside of each of us. The good of nature. The unborn. The un-extinguished. But on the surface, all of it keeps changing. Up one day, down the next day. Un-extinguished. Un-permanent. Constantly. In a state of becoming. Nothing fixed. It's what we call the cycle of life and death.

Being caught in that cycle of life and death is due to ignorance. Ignorance of a true nature. Once you begin the process, and really put yourself into it, begins to appear, as it's always been. It's always been there. It's hidden. Sometimes it's confusing. On one side, we talk about impermanence. The constant state of becoming. And on the other hand, we say that when the world is destroyed, it is not destroyed. What is it that survives the destruction of the universe?

Basically, what we're talking about is this golden carp. A golden carp is a big goldfish, is what it is. It's the ones that are held in very high regard by the Japanese. But they're basically a carp. And the gold one is the golden carp. And the golden carp is kind of like the student. And somewhere along the journey, and it goes back to an old Chinese legend, it said that King Yu, there was a gate called King Yu's Gate, and it was a triple-tiered falls, waterfalls, quite high, that the carp would come up that river in the third month to come to this Yu Gate, or Dragon Gate, it's called.

And of course, what they have to do is swim upstream against the current. And once they get to the falls, they have to leap the falls. And the ones that manage to leap the falls are transformed into dragons. The way they're transformed into dragons, as they leap into the air, the bolt of lightning comes and singes their tail. And at that moment, they're transformed into dragons. And of course, the dragon is an enlightened being. And immediately, the dragon follows the wind and rides the clouds, free, in the ten directions.

And that struggle up the river is what our practice is all about. I don't know if you've ever seen the salmon do it, the shad do it. In a couple of weeks, we'll see blossoming. I saw this morning, yesterday was the first day of springs. This morning, when I was going back, there were the robins. I need to follow the calendar. They weren't here the day before. They're here today. And in a few weeks, we'll see the shad trees along this mountain, along the river, begin to bloom.

They have white blossoms. When those shad trees begin to bloom, the shad begin running up the rivers. They've returned now, even to the Hudson River. For years, they were gone because of the pollution. They just didn't come. And I think after 20 years, they cleaned up the river. And suddenly, the shad are coming. But how do they know that? And it's always the same ones. They always return to their place of birth.

So, the ones coming up to Hudson are several generations removed. More than several. I mean, 20 years. 20 generations removed. And the ones that would come wouldn't be able to get up the river in 20 years, I don't know where they went. But now, they're coming back up the river. Many times, canoeing down the Delaware River, when you hit the shallow parts of the river, and sometimes you have to walk the canoe, you see the shad coming up.

And they're a pretty good-sized fish. Foot and a half long, some of them two feet. All torn to pieces by the current. I mean, they go through incredible rapids. And when they go through the shallows, sometimes it's not deep enough for them to swim in. So, basically, what they're doing is crawling over rocks. Half of their bodies are out of the water. And they're leaping and crawling. Their skin is shredded and bleeding.

And all along the way, you'll see some that don't make it. They're just declining. You get up close to the top of the river. You see them coming. I mean, just. They have to get up there to lay these eggs. After they do that, they die. And then the next generation takes off. Kind of a very powerful image. You see that incredible force of nature fulfilling one's karma. And the karma of all sentient beings and all sentient beings is realization. It's to realize ourselves. It's to transform ourselves.

That's what it's about. The possibility exists, but millions of people don't even know live their life of pain and suffering and go to their graves that way and usually transmit it to the next generation, their children, who follow the same course. Somebody breaks out of that, answers the call of that inherent. Whenever any of us come to practice, we don't know. It's all intuition. There's a deep feeling somewhere deep inside that there's a way out of the confusion and craziness begin to look.

And we discover it. We wouldn't be sitting here if we didn't have complete faith in the Buddhist ancestors that are climbing that triple-tiered falls. There's no easy matter. This is not an easy practice. No question about it. All of them that have preceded us, all of them, have gone through the same struggle that each of us goes through. Many of them, much, much worse.

The difficulties in entering and maintaining the practice in the 20th century in America, it's really no big deal. It's a little inconvenient. You've got to rearrange your schedule. You hop a plane, or go to where a monastery is. You know where they are. It's published. There are maps and addresses and everything is nice and logically arranged.

But these monks would hear of a master somewhere a thousand miles across the mountains and off they would go. And that's what we're talking about. That's what Se Shin is all about. It's not just sitting in a room, it's not just sitting on a cushion. It's a journey up the river. It's a journey to the top of the falls. It's a journey to the other side.

Now, let's talk about Xuyang Feng and Yinshan Feng. Xuyang Feng said, when you come out of the net, I'll tell you. Yinshan Feng said, teacher of fifteen hundred monks and yet you don't have anything to say? It's the best you can do? And Xuyang Feng said, I have many duties as an abbot. I'm very busy.

No, this is kind of an interesting dialogue that's going on. Here are two equally matched adepts. But how do you know that? And why did he say, when you come out of the net, then I'll tell you? In other words, when you're enlightened, I'll let you know.

One master said, Shenfeng at first is thirty steps away watching you looking in yourself and drawing out yourself. And then he said, wait until you come out of the net and I'll tell you. Then he compares it to a national champion playing chess, seeing the whole thing, many, many moves ahead, seeing the whole thing at once, not being just stuck in that one place, 360 degree awareness, watching you looking in yourself and drawing yourself out.

The fact is that there's no place to hide. We constantly reveal ourselves in every action. We speak of samadhi. Samadhi is not something that you can hide. A person who has experienced even the edges of samadhi, it shows immediately. And it doesn't just appear and vanish, it shows.

And particularly when you take it all into account, the whole 24 hours, and see it in that context. The same with the koan. We reveal always what our understanding is. You can, many students over the years now, particularly lately, there's a constant stream of students that come from other centers. Some of them have actually completed their studies. Others are very mature students.

One koan is all it takes to see exactly, precisely where their understanding is. Any koan, doesn't matter what it is. The beginning koan, middle koan, end koan, any one of them can be seen in a hundred different ways, from a very, very gross seeing of it to a very, very subtle interworking games. So we play.

It's kind of interesting. A few years in a row, we've done softball games in the summer and I videotaped it. Sometimes I sit and look at that videotape and you can see precisely the way people practice by how they play softball. Exactly how they practice, exactly how their life goes, by how much goes into the game, by how much they put themselves out there, how much they're willing to take a risk, how much they're willing to damage themselves.

Fish, and even resting, eating, service, study, asking questions and making answers, how we deal with pain, how we deal with pressure. You know, I mean, I've said it before and I'll say it again a hundred times, people come to a monastery thinking they're coming to a sanctuary and I asked the Guardian Council constantly to make sure people are clear, particularly people that come to a weekend.

They come here with some idea that it's going to be a place of bliss and they find out they've got to sit and it's all hell for them. They've been spending their lives avoiding it themselves and suddenly they have to confront themselves. It's not a sanctuary, it's a furnace. furnace, it's specifically designed to be a furnace, every aspect of it is a furnace, every aspect of practice is a furnace.

People come thinking Zazen is going to be tranquility. Zazen is a gigantic, monstrous, huge cosmic enema. Its function is to wash away all traces. When you come out of the net, I'll tell you, if there was a speck of doubt in Shansheng, he would immediately have disintegrated. He didn't. Bounced right back.

One lets go, the other holds back. The other lets go, the other holds back. It was like a beautiful dance. Teacher of 1500 people, yet you don't even know a saying. My tasks as abbot are many. Beautifully.

Old master said, when contending, there's not enough. When conceding, there's always extra. Other master said, the golden fish that's passed through the net, what does it have for food? His teacher said, dry dung. Another teacher said, thanks for the offering.

When first ascending, the tear of waves, clouds and thunder accompany. Leaping up magnificently, look at the great function. The great function is the truth. True self. The reality. That's the life of each one of us. Buried under conditioning. We never get a chance to really live out of that reality. We tend to live out of the conditioning. We live out of the program.

With a burdened tail, it clearly crosses the gate of you, being transformed into a dragon. The beautiful fish won't agree to be sunk in a pickle jar. That's kind of interesting. I think it was Rinzai who said he was seeing one of his students off. And he said, in the school of Rinzai, there's a red fin carp who wags his head and swishes his tail and heads south.

In whose house will it die immersed in a pickle jar? That pickle jar is a dead fish whose pickle jar we find ourselves in. The whole point of practice is to not end up in a pickle jar, but rather to be a live dragon rather than a dead fish.

An old mature man does not startle the crowd. That's a well, the first one, burnt tail, he clearly crosses the gate of you. The beautiful fish wouldn't agree to be stuck in a pickle jar. That's speaking of course Sancho praising him.

The next two lines, an old mature man does not startle the crowd, is a way of appreciating, eulogizing seppo. But that doesn't seem like much of a praise. An old mature man doesn't startle the crowd. But it's the most highest kind of praise that can be heaped on someone.

He's exactly like his old master Tokusan was. Remember when Tokusan came down and he said, oh man, where are you going? The bell hasn't rung, the drum hasn't sounded. And Tokusan just meekly turned around and went back to his room like he was a novice. That was his absolute maturity.

The wind blows from the east, leaves gather in the west. And so it is with seppo. There's nothing startling about him. I've got lots of work to do as the abbot. And yet, right through the heart. The food of the dragon. Fifteen courses laid out.

Next line says, someone used to facing a great adversary has no fear from the start. I mean, you know, Tokusan was probably the greatest adversary anybody would ever face. Seppo survived Tokusan. But me worry? There's no one to think about Tokusan.

The tougher, the training is, the tougher the teacher is, the more prepared for the world, for the practice, for life. The more free the successor is. And it's the same all through nature. There is a species that doesn't have that working point.

Floating, floating, just as light as five ounces. Massive, massive, heavier than even a thousand tons. Sen Shang exalted fame over the four seas. Who again was his peer? Tremendous master. Both of these were around the same age. Both of them the same lineage, I mean the same generation.

Two different lineages. Seppo stands alone, the eight winds blowing, do not move him. The eight winds blowing, the eight winds of profit, decline, slander, fame, praise, censure, pain, pleasure. One side or the other side. Profit or decline, slander or fame, praise or blame, pain or pleasure.

Completely unaffected. They're like a breeze passing by his ear. One master says you see his jowls, the jowls on his head from behind. That's an indication of a very powerful person looking at him from behind. His jowls are so big you can see them from the back of his head hanging out the sides.

And about his standing alone and the eight winds blowing, do not move him. The master said it's just as if it never happened. So what's it all about? It's about that journey up the river. So it seems. It seems to be a struggle. It doesn't need to be a struggle.

Life is only a struggle because of all the extra. I mean, it's not only that we're swimming up the river but we're dragging along with us all this baggage and spend a lot of time trying to avoid engaging. To engage your life is to engage your practice. That means to give yourself up to it. To allow it to be. To remove from it all the preconceived notions about it.

All the expectations about it. Just allow it to be. It means to give up ideas, positions, postures. When we're finally holding on to nothing, it's streamlined. Then the great way of the ancestors is without hindrance. Then the struggle is over. Just like that fifth ox-herding picture. Doesn't mean you need to go all the way to the end. Still halfway along.

Struggle is over. It's like spring itself. There's nothing that can be done about spring. When it arrives, it's truly here. Put up with an H-year's life. Just get rid of the extra. You know you're holding on to something. There's even a speck. That's all it means to begin.

No one to hold on. Nothing to hold on to. Simple zazen of shikantaza. simple zazen of following the breath. It's not complicated. The first step to reaching there is samadhi. You need to trust yourself to let it happen. You need to trust the process of practice.

It really is simple. We make it complicated. We make it complicated because of our fears or anxieties or greed or ignorance all of which are based on holding on that called Buddhism itself that called enlightenment and then the ten thousand things return to the self where they've always been right from the beginning. There's nothing to gain but a whole universe.
