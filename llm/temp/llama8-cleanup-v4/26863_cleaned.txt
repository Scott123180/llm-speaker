The Book of Equanimity, Case 50, Shui Feng's What Is It, Preface to the Assembly. At the last word you finally reach the impenetrable barrier. Yen Tu is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother. Do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions? Or then again, is there a special operation?

The main case. When Shui Feng was living in a hut, two monks came to pay respects to him. Shui Feng, seeing them coming, opened the door, popped out and said, "What is it?" A monk also said, "What is it?" Shui Feng lowered his head and went back inside.

Later the monk came to Yen Tu. Yen Tu asked, "Where have you come from?" The monk said, "South of the range." Yen Tu said, "Did you ever go see Shui Feng?" The monk said, "Yes." Yen Tu asked, "What was said?" The monk recounted the preceding story.

Yen Tu said, "What did he say then?" The monk said, "He didn't say anything. He just lowered his head and went back inside." Yen Tu said, "Too bad I didn't tell him the last word before. If I had told him the last word, no one in the world could affect O Shui Feng."

At the end of the summer, the monk again brought up the story and inquired further about it. Yen Tu said, "Why didn't you ask about it earlier?" The monk said, "I didn't dare to." Take it lightly.

Yen Tu said, "Do Shui Feng is born of the same lineage as me. He doesn't die of the same lineage as me. If you want to know the last word, just this is it. The verse. Cutting, carving, polishing, grinding. Changing appearances with mixed dialect. The staff changed into a dragon in Lake Gibi. The shuttle hibernating in the Tao house. Born of the same lineage, there are numbers. Dying of the same lineage, there is no multitude."

The last word, just this is it. The wind boat, ferrying the moon, floats on the autumn waters. There's just one full day of the session remaining for us. Some of you have been struggling with pain that's come up as a result of the sitting. And it's kind of interesting how that pain, the physical pain, will also trigger lots of other stuff. And give you really an opportunity to work with the things that come up.

It's hard to keep them suppressed when the pain kind of routes them out. Pain has a way of bringing the stress points in our life into, up where we can see them. And in a sense, we can say that practice is a succession of barriers that need to be dealt with. At first, they're the obvious barriers that we know of. Then later they become, when you run out, any good training matrix will provide new ones for you.

And in the end, when training is finally finished, formal training is over, it's not that there are no more barriers. It's just that there's no hindrance. Muge. No hindrance. No hindrance in the mind.

Our tendency is to deal with barriers when they pop up in kind of conditioned ways. Different people deal with them differently. The more arrogant among us will get angry and fight. The more timid among us will have a tendency to withdraw or to run, to move away from them. Some of us just make ourselves numb. Others just simply deny it.

As if, in a lot of how we deal with the barriers in practice, it's a lot to do with how we deal with barriers in our life. And basically, usually, how we have been dealing with them all of our life. Of course, practice gives us a new way of approaching it. And that is to immediately and completely merge with the barrier. Be the barrier. Instead of running away from it to turn 180 degrees and become the barrier. So that it ultimately fills the whole universe.

When it does that, and you and the barrier are not separate, 10,000 things have returned to the self. Where they've always been. Right from the beginnings.

In this introduction, he talks about the impenetrable barrier. At the last word, you finally reach the impenetrable barrier. Yanto is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother. Do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions or then again, is this a special operation?

It's kind of an interesting little clue to the koan. The last word, you finally reach the impenetrable barrier. The impenetrable barrier we also call the killing sword. Myth has it in Zen circles that the most difficult koan is mu. That's not the case. The impenetrable barrier is the most difficult one.

The impenetrable barrier, the killing sword, will come up again and again. And if you're working with a single teacher, usually very early on in training, it becomes obvious where that sticking point is among miscellaneous koans. And it's kind of interesting that a student that will stick in a particular kind of koan among the miscellaneous koans, again and again throughout their koan study, that will keep coming up, and that is, provides the killing sword.

Ganto is so sure of himself that above he doesn't agree with his own teacher and below he doesn't concede to his Dharma brother. Yento is Ganto, and Shifong is the Chinese pronunciation of Seppo. There's a story in the history of these two monks, of Ganto and Seppo, and their teacher Toksan, and some of the skillful means that went on there. That's what he's alluding to here.

He says, do you think this is forcibly creating subdivisions, the fact that he doesn't agree with Seppo, his Dharma brother? They're both trained as a same master. Or then again, is this a special operation? They may be disagreeing, yet as far as I'm concerned, it's all dirt from the same hole. Toksan lineage.

There are all kinds of special operations. As I'm training, I've told many of you about one of the special operations that we used to have at ZCLA back in the days when I was training there, at the same time Gimpo was training there, was we had a special zendo, a separate zendo.

We had the main zendo where most people would go, and these were people who were basically studying with Roshi. And Tetsugen had already emerged as a teacher, and he would be doing doksan there, too. And then in the hotbox, Gimpo would be doing doksan, or interview. And I would be working with Gimpo as the head monk, kind of the pushing person.

And all the people who were working on Mu would go to the hotbox, voluntarily because everybody knew its reputation. It was a scathing furnace. We would sit, usually, all night long, pulsession. We'd sleep maybe two hours, three hours, and doksan would go on all night long. And we'd really push very hard.

The people that wanted to be pushed, the other ones, would stay in the other zendo and do it with Roshi, and his approach was much gentler. And basically, my job was, is when someone was very close, to squeeze them. And so the doksan room was outside of the, I think there were 50 or 60 people sitting there.

The line would form in the next room, and then there was a flight of stairs that went up the top of the stairs. There was a little room, and that was the doksan room. And people that were very close, we would know. It's obvious when somebody's very, very close to seeing you.

I would follow them up into the doksan room, and I'd wait outside the door for them. And I'd hear the campos saying, "Oh, deeper!" And he'd ring his bell, and then they'd come out the door, and I'd be standing there, and I'd say, "Did he pass you?" And they'd say, "No. Get back in there and show him!"

But I don't know what to do. Get back in there! And I'd throw him back in, and he'd fall down on the floor, and Gimpo would look at him and say, "You back again? What is it? What is it?" I don't know. Get out of here! And ring the bell.

And I would meet him outside, and we'd go through it again. And sometimes it would take a few rounds, but eventually they would get it. And when they got it, it was like a whole new world opened up for them.

There was one student who was particularly stubborn. He just couldn't seem to get it, no matter how many times he went through the doksan. I was getting a little frustrated with him, to be honest. But then one day, something just clicked, and he got it.

And when he got it, it was like a whole new world opened up for him. He was like a different person. And it was amazing to see the transformation that took place in him.

Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "This is all well and good, but what about the monk who came to see Seppo?" Well, let me tell you about that.

When the monk came to see Seppo, Seppo was not very welcoming. He just dropped his head and turned around and went back into the hut. The monk was confused. He didn't know what to make of it.

Later, the monk came to see Yen Tu, Seppo's Dharma brother. Yen Tu asked him, "Where have you come from?" The monk said, "South of the range." Yen Tu said, "Did you ever go see Seppo?"

The monk said, "Yes." Yen Tu asked, "What was said?" The monk recounted the story of his encounter with Seppo. Yen Tu said, "What did he say then?" The monk said, "He didn't say anything. He just lowered his head and went back inside."

Yen Tu said, "Too bad I didn't tell him the last word before. If I had told him the last word, no one in the world could affect Seppo." And that's when it hit me. That's when I realized that Seppo was not just being stubborn or difficult. He was being a true master.

He was showing the monk that the last word is not something that can be taught or explained. It's something that has to be experienced. And Seppo was giving the monk a chance to experience it for himself.

But the monk didn't get it. He didn't understand. And that's when I realized that the monk was not just a student, but also a teacher. He was teaching Seppo and Yen Tu about the importance of being open-minded and receptive.

And that's when it hit me. That's when I realized that the whole thing was not just about Seppo and the monk, but about all of us. We're all on this journey together, and we're all learning from each other.

So, let's take a deep breath and let go of our preconceptions. Let's be open-minded and receptive. Let's allow ourselves to be taught by each other. And let's see where this journey takes us.

It's almost like a game, isn't it? A game of hide and seek. We're all hiding behind our masks, our illusions. But the truth is, we're all just pretending. We're all just playing a role.

And the game is over when we finally see through the illusion. When we finally see the real person underneath. And that's when life begins.

It's almost kind of still silly. Dragons wearing dragon masks. So take it off. Take them all off. Take off the mundane masks. Take off the sacred masks. Take off the holy masks and the profane masks. Take off the timid masks. Take off the arrogant masks, the snake masks, and the dragon masks.

Underneath it all is the real thing just waiting to be discovered. After me.
