The Blue Cliff Record, Case 10, Bokushu's thieving phony, Master Engo's pointer. Like this, not like this. In dharma combat each occupies a pivotal position, that's why it is said, if you turn upwards then even Shakyamuni, Maitreya, Manjushri, Samantabhadra and the myriad sages together with all the masters in the world, all suck in their breath and swallow their voices. If you turn downwards, worms and maggots and everything that crawls, all sentient beings, each and every one admits great shining light, each and every one towers like a wall miles high. If on the other hand you neither face upwards nor downwards, how will you deal? If there is a principle, go by the principle. If there is no principle, go by the example. To test, I cite this. Listen. The main case. Bokushu asked the monk, where have you come from? The monk immediately shouted.

Bokushu said, I've been shouted at by you once. Again, the monk shouted. Bokushu said, after three or four shouts, then what? The monk had nothing to say. Bokushu hit him and said, what a thieving phony you are. Master Setcho's verse. Two shouts and a third shout. Adepts recognized the opportune moment to change. If you call that riding the tiger's head, the two of them would both turn out to be blind men. Who is a blind man? I bring it out for everyone to see.

This is our first full day of the session. The time that most people spend getting acclimated to the session environment. I begin quieting down. Settling the mind. Focusing the mind. Settling the body. And both the Shikantaza practice and the practice of concentration are both the practice of ultimately emptying out the mind. We're accustomed to occupying ourselves with a constant and steady stream of thoughts. And it's that steady stream of thoughts that reaffirms the illusion of I. It's kind of a way of bouncing off the idea of the self, reconfirming the idea of the self.

But when you begin to allow the thought process to slow down and then ultimately stop, a whole different reality begins to emerge. And it's amazing how deep the habit patterns go because for many of you, particularly those who have been practicing here for a number of years, every time we go into a session, the first couple of days is just a lot of mental activity. Usually by the third day, people's internal dialogue begins to settle down. And a whole different kind of communication begins to take place. And for the most part, the student doesn't even notice it. But to me, it's very, very clear.

I'm able to reveal things in a way that the student was blind to only a few short days before. Not only does a whole different kind of communication begin to evolve, but also a whole different kind of reality the student is beginning to see. And then usually that lingers for a few days after session or maybe even a week or two depending upon the student and depending upon how how much effort they put into their sitting. But sooner or later it disappears and it's as if session never happened, but actually something has taken place.

There's a different level that the student is functioning on. But then again, by the time the next session comes around, the whole process is repeated. And again, a couple of days need to go by and we reach that place. The communication happens a little bit more it's transmitted. A little bit more is assimilated. And again it slips away and that process is repeated again and again. And the thing that happens during the session and the thing that's lost after the session is essentially that mental activity.

Somehow in the sitting and in the form of session we come to trust not having to figure things out and allow our intuition to come forth. I've even seen students pass through the first barrier and have no sense of what was seen two weeks later, two weeks later. Actually in my own case it was the same thing. and it took constant seeing it again and again and again to make it clearer. So emptying the mind is one of the critical parts of our training. That's the way that we gain entrance to seeing what it means to be the breath. Seeing what it means to just sit to be the koan.

The minute the thought arises the separation occurs. There's the thinker and the thought. And that's what's going on here. In reference to that I received a letter recently from someone who is not a student of Zen but rather a subscriber to the Mountain Record and a well when I say not a student I mean not a practicing student. He reads lots of books on Zen and has a very good understanding of it. He could probably write one of those books himself. And he's a psychologist and enjoys the Mountain Record and wrote a letter and described his situation in working as a psychologist with I guess disturbed children and their parents and from his perspective he can see clearly what's needed but the parents don't necessarily see it and what he is perceiving is a lot of unnecessary pain and suffering their ways of dealing with this but there are all these barriers that are thrown up in his path and it frustrates him frustrates him to a point where he's now suffering from colitis which is I think a stress-related problem and so now he's on medication and diet and he said to me in the letter my mind understands all of this but my body won't go along with it it's a problem that anybody reading Zen will find it's very easy to acknowledge the stuff that's being said it makes sense but intellectualizing it doesn't help manifesting it in your life.

Obviously the one important thing that he needed to do that he hadn't done yet was Zen he thinks the mind and the body are separate when he realizes body-mind unity in the process of sitting when he learns how to let go and how do you learn how to let go you learn how to let go by practicing letting go well what does it mean to practice letting go it means that when a thought comes up and takes you away from your breath you acknowledge it let it go and come back to the breath that's to practice it and it comes up again and takes you away and you come back to the breath after you let it go that's learning to let go so the key is obviously not just understanding it in fact understanding sometimes even gets in the way I know lots of people that don't understand it at all who yet are able to practice it totally in their life understanding or not understanding is aside from the actual fact the fact is the direct experience itself.

Ingo in his point it says like this not like this each occupies a pivotal position in dharma combat there are several translations of that it's also said called yes is yes no is no another translation says so so not so not so but basically what they're saying is like this not like this and he says if you turn upwards then even Shakyamuni Maitreya Manjushri Samantabhadra and all the sages all of the masters can't say anything they suck in their breath and swallow their voices and that's the place that's neither eye ear nose tongue body or mind then if you turn downward worms maggots everything that crawls all sentient beings each and everyone emits a great shining light that's coming down off the mountain back into the world but what he's directing our attention to is if on the other hand you neither face upward nor downward how do you deal with things what is the truth of neither facing upward nor downward and then he cites his example bogus asked the monk where have you come from the monk immediately shouted bogus who said i've been shouted by you once again the monk shouted bogus who said after three or four shouts then what the monk had nothing to say bogus who hit him and said what a thieving phony you are bogus who is a successor in the same lineage as rinzai in fact he and rinzai were dharma brothers and they were both students of albaku and the use of the shout is something that first came from baso said that baso one day let out a great shout in response to a question of yakujo that left yakujo deaf for two or three days yakujo was the teacher of obaku and he on occasion used the shout obaku used it often and rinzai whole school was noted for the use of the shout the shout is kind of interesting because it's not a word and it has no meaning the word shout has a meaning but shout itself has no meaning and yet it's an expression often times it's used as an expression of the truth but it's not so simple as that to all different kinds of shouts just like there are all different kinds of hits so obaku shuhidam it could be an approval it could be a disapproval or it could be making a point of the dharma and it's the same with the shouts and the question here is what's going on does this monk have any understanding and it's kind of interesting there are two translations of this koan available that are published and even the names are different one of them it's titled bokushu's empty headed fool and the other it's titled bokushu's thieving phony and then in the main case itself there's an interesting difference bokushu asked the monk where are you from the monk gave a shout bokushu said this old monk has shouted down by you the monk shouted again bokushu said what about after the third and fourth shouts the monk stayed silent bokushu hit the monk and said you empty headed fool that translation could indicate that it was an approval he said the monk stayed stayed stayed silent as if the monk was showing silence in the clury translation it said the monk had nothing to say or the monk was speechless there's a big difference between being speechless and silent and then when he hit him and said you empty headed fool empty headed could be a compliment in fact the translator of that version calls it an instance of approving while seemingly to denigrate and that's only because the translator doesn't understand the koan hasn't seen the koan the other translation says what a thieving phony you are much clearer as a disapproval.

The question of course in this koan is after the first shout and Bokushu said I've been shouted down by you how do you respond and again after the second shout Bokushu said after three or four shouts then what how do you respond for the monk in order to avoid being called the thieving phony and ghost said here if you can discern survival and destruction and distinguish right and wrong if your feet tread the ground of reality you should be able to deal with it since this monk was speechless the case was decided by old Bokushu on the basis of the facts and that happens a lot that's part of the deal if you're going to confront the dharma and test yourself against a master like Bokushu you've got to be prepared for the consequences.

I remember I remember some years ago in fact it was in 1976 75 or 76 at Naropa when it first opened it was a gala spiritual circus people came from all over the country and from Europe South America to go to the big circus I think there were over 2,000 people there that summer and one of the big drawing cards was Ram Dass he was invited there by Trungpa Rinpoche and one night during one of the assemblies 2,000 people seated in the audience in Ram Dass and Rinpoche up in front of everybody when Ram Dass was talking or responding to questions or something Rinpoche turned to him and said you're an imposter and a lot of the people in the audience followers of Ram Dass were very very upset by that big controversy evolved nobody understood why he said that and he never never explained it to anyone either should he have said it was it right what did he see is he indeed an imposter later years he called himself an imposter himself and said that what he had been doing in those years is every time he would go out and give a talk that he was so terrified that when he was on the circuit spiritual circuit going from place to place he would get stoned he had to get high in order to reveal the truth and that was his own admission was that what Rinpoche saw and even if he did see it is it right to say it and it happens all the time was it right for Dogen to say what he said about the Hinayana teachings or the Rinzai masses to say what they say about the Soto teachings and on and on and on back and forth they say how can this be the teaching of wisdom and compassion when you put each other down the precepts even say don't elevate oneself and put down others why is he calling him a thieving phony that's putting down somebody you also have to understand for the purpose of the teachings teachers have thrown monks off bridges kasan you remember was held under water by tokuju drowning him bringing him right to the edge of his death then pulling him out and say what is it stick his head back down in there seem like really extraordinary lengths to go to bring someone to realization sometimes wonder how many have died in the process we don't hear about those is it worth it again it depends on the student and it depends on the teacher usually this doesn't happen unless there's an empowerment unless permission is given there's always a guest and a host in the dharma combat the question is here pretty clear that the guest is the monk and the host is bokashu but in the verse he says two shouts and a third shout adepts recognize the opportune moment to change if you call that riding the tiger's head the two of them would both turn out to be blind men who's blind I bring it out for everyone to see.

Let me remind you about the different kinds of blindness when that word is used there's the blindness of ignorance having no light not knowing what's real not yet realizing it there's the blindness of the heretic and there's also the blindness of enlightenment no eye ear nose tongue body mind no color sound smell taste touch phenomena well that blindness is usually used either it can be used in an approving way but it also can be used in a disapproving way because you can't do anything with no eye ear nose tongue body or mind that's what we call the field littered with skulls dead people making you living in a ghost cave then there's a fourth kind of blindness where you're stuck in enlightenment where you're holding on to enlightenment that's always put down then there's transcendent blindness or maturity in one's practice the blindness of a of a sage the blindness of an adept and sometimes that blindness is used as a word of approval such as in the case I've mentioned many times of Rinzai when he was dying his successor was standing there with him and Rinzai was breathing his last breath and looked up at the successor and said after I'm gone and people ask what is the teaching of Rinzai how will you answer them no he said please don't let my my dharma be extinguished it's the first thing he said and the successor said how could I let your dharma be extinguished which immediately shows this level of understanding how do you extinguish the dharma show me extinguish it then Rinzai said then what will you do when someone many years from now asks you what's the teaching of Rinzai and the successor said huh Rinzai said to think my dharma is in the hands of this blind ass and he died but that was approval the blindness that he was approving very different from the blindness of delusion or the blindness of being stuck in enlightenment.

Another master said I see all of you shouting in the east hall and shouting in the west hall don't shout at random even if you shout me up to the heavens break me to pieces and I fall back down again without even a trace of breath left in me wait for me to revive and I tell you it's still not enough why I have never set out real pearls for you inside the purple curtains inside the purple curtains is the doksan room as for all of you here what are you doing when you just go on with wild random shouting Rinzai himself said I've heard all of you imitate my shouting but I ask you if a monk comes from the east hall and another monk comes from the west hall and they both shout at once which one is the guest and which one is the host if you can't distinguish host and guest then you must not imitate me anymore after this that's actually one of the koans among the 200 so Setsho says in this verse adepts recognize the opportune moment to change although this monk was taken in by Bokushu still he could perceive the opportune moment to change do you see where he did this it also shows some perception some understanding the fact that he was able to do that an old master said of this monk one who knows the law fears it someone that has no idea at all couldn't be taken in by this dialogue with Bokushu this monk knew just enough but not enough enough to be thrown off by the dialogue but not enough not enough to have reached down and taken his meditation seat turned it upside down the master said when you reach an impasse change having changed then you get through well you can't change if you're locked into your ideas positions attitudes opinions force of will not because they're free of the idea of a self the self is non abiding it rests nowhere it takes up anything any place any time as its position time and place it's free to move about and do that sometimes it manifests as a dragon head sometimes it manifests as a demon always in accord with the circumstances always acting according to imperative.

So what was the monk's understanding how could you respond for the monk why does he say in his poem if you call that riding the tiger's head the two of them would both turn out to be blind men does focus you blind there are a couple of important points to be seen here but seeing the point still doesn't put it in your life but it ultimately boils down to is the question that that student asks in that letter basically he's asking how do you manifest in the world yet never having left the mountain how do you stay on the mountain and be in the world how do you transcend the dualities of absolute and relative that non abiding mind doesn't stick anywhere and the way you develop that non sticking non abiding mind is in the practice of zazen and the zazen is not just cross-legged zazen it's the zazen of activity the opportunity comes up all the time to acknowledge throw away and keep going to empty yourself of thoughts ideas positions likes dislikes love hate make yourself empty and when you're empty really empty get rid of that too the truth is in neither of the extremes the reason we make that statement is that form or the absolute are the same thing that the ten thousand things the world of samsara is identical to sunyata or what we say the void emptiness so it's not a big black hole it's not a state of despair it's full it's complete it contains everything it's the cornucopia of life itself they're not two things or three things there's not absolute and relative and neither absolute nor relative it's not a 50-50 mixture it's not black white and gray the persistent gentle rain the raging river and the great ocean itself are not three separate things.
