Master Dogen's 300 Koan Shobo Ginzo Case 20 Cheng Sha's Stop Illusory Thinking

The main case Priest Cheng Sha was once asked by the government secretary, Du: When you chop an earthworm into two pieces, both pieces keep moving. I wonder, in which piece is the Buddha nature?

Cheng Sha said, "Don't have illusory thoughts."

Du said, "How are we to understand that they are both moving?"

Cheng Sha said, "Understand that air and fire are not yet scattered."

Du said nothing.

Cheng Sha called out to him, "Secretary Du," and Du responded, "Yes."

Cheng Sha said, "Isn't this your true self?"

Du said, "Apart from my answering, is there another true self?"

Cheng Sha said, "I can't call you emperor."

Du said, "If so, would my not answering also be my true self?"

Cheng Sha said, "It's not a matter of answering me or not, but the question to answer or not has been since the beginningless Kalpa, the root of birth and death."

And then he recited a verse.

Students of the way don't know the truth. They only know their past consciousness. This is the basis of endless birth and death. They call it the original self.

Inconceivably wondrous is the Buddha nature. Buddha nature, exquisitely all-pervading, is no Buddha nature. It has nothing to do with cosmic consciousness or the divine self. Both Buddha nature and no Buddha nature exist in life and in death, as well as prior to life and death, and after life and death.

Before there ever was scattering and no scattering, movement and stillness, being and non-being, there has always been Buddha nature and no Buddha nature. It is not metaphor, images, or thoughts. Indeed, it is not like anything. Don't be deluded. It is nothing other than what you do morning and night.

The Capping Verse:

Bright day
Blue sky
In a dream
He tries to explain his dream
See
The myriad forms
Arising and vanishing
All abiding
In their own Dharma place
Constantly reveal
The Buddha nature

And this is another one of those koans of Master Dogen from his 300 koan collection that he used in a very long fascicle. And since the literature Abounds in Various koans Concerning Buddha nature He quotes Just about all of them Of course The koan Of Joshu Joshu's Moo Addresses Buddha nature

And keep in mind When Joshu answered That question Does a dog Have Buddha nature The one that we work with The first koan In the Mumongkan He answered Moo Or no And But in the Book of Equanimity Is the second part To that koan Where a monk Asks Does a dog Have Buddha nature And he said Yes

And We've looked That koans Where the sixth ancestor Said The fifth ancestor Said to the Sixth ancestor That you have No Buddha nature Yakujo Addresses Buddha nature Unman Addresses Buddha nature

And needless to say Buddha nature Is at the Heart Of what our practice Is about Is about

And what it's about Is to realize Our Buddha nature So that's what This government Officer Was attempting To do He was studying With priest Chang Shah

And I've mentioned Before that Chang Shah Was kind of Poetic In his way Of dealing With the dharma They're different In Unman And Joshu Unman and Joshu Had the facility Of using Turning words And directly Pointing to the truth Chang Shah Did it With With a poem So he expressed It Poetically Rather than With what we call A turning word

And He was one of The great Masters Of The past And There are Many koans That deal with Chang Shah's Teaching All of them You'll find Some kind of Poetic expression

And He had As his Students Many Government Officials In this Case This was A government Secretary Kind of Like Secretary Of State Or Secretary Of the Interior High Government Official

And Probably That has A lot To do With The way The koan Evolves

And What This Secretary Wanted To know Is When You Chop An Earthworm Into Two Pieces Both Pieces Keep Moving

And I Think Every Kid Has Experienced This And Probably Wondered Which Is Really The Earthworm This Fellow Wanted To Know Which Piece Had The Buddha Nature

And Chang Sha's Answer Was Simply Don't Have Illusory Thoughts Don't Be Deluded Or Even I've Seen The Translation Of This Stop Worrying About It

But He Persisted He Said How Are We To Understand That They're Both Moving

And Chang Sha Said Understand That Air And Fire Are Not Yet Scattered

And Basically What He Was Saying Is The Elements Earth Air Fire And Water Which Supposedly Constitute All Living Things

And The Way They Understood It At That Time Is When These Elements Dispersed Death Occurred

So What He Was He Was Saying Is That Air And Fire Not Yet Scattered

But Was The Implication Here In That Statement

And This Is One Of The Points You Have To Deal With In This Coen That If It Did Scatter That There Would Be No Buddha Nature

Is That What He Is Trying To Say

Or In Fact Is He Saying That The Reason They're Both Moving Is That The Elements Are Still Intact The Earthworm Is Not Yet Dead

So Du Said Nothing

And Then Chang Sha Called Out To Him Secretary Du

Du Responded Yes Master

And Chang Sha Said Isn't This Your True Self Isn't This Your True Nature

And Then Du Went On To Say Apart From My Answering Is There Another True Self

In Other Words Is There Another Part Of It

He's Still Back With The Earthworm Which Side Has It

Both Sides Have It

One Side Have It

Neither Side Have It

When It's Cut In Half It's No Longer In Earthworm

So Chang Sha Said I Can't Call You Emperor

You Do So That's What I Call You

And Du Said If So Would My Not Answering Also Be My True Self

He Said If You Called Me Emperor And I Didn't Answer Would That Not Answering Also Be My True Self

Chang Shao Said It's Not A Matter Of Answering Me Or Not

But The Question To Answer Or Not Has Since The Beginning With Kalpa Been The Root Of Birth And Death

That Is To See This Answering Or Not Answering As Two Separate Things

To See Self And Other As Two Separate Things

To See Buddha Nature Or Know Buddha Nature As Two Separate Things

Is The Root Of Birth Death Birth And Death

Only Exists In Duality

When There's A Self And There's Other Then There's Heaven And Hell

And There's Birth And Death

And There's Good And Bad

Up And Down

Enlightenment And Delusion

And Cheng Sha Went On To Say Students Of The Way Don't Know The Truth

They Only Know Their Past Consciousness

This Is The Basis Of Endless Birth And Death

The Deluded Call It The Original Self

What is The Past Consciousness That He's Speaking Of

The Commentary Kind of Summarizes The Whole Thing

Inconceivably wondrous Is The Buddha nature

Just That Description Inconceivably Wondrous

Inconceivable Unable To Be Conceived Of

There's No Way To Conjure A Thought To Conceive Of Buddha Nature

Whatever You Think It Is It's Not

Exquisitely All Pervading Is No Buddha nature

Buddha nature And No Buddha nature Are Mutually Arising Codependent And Not Separate From Each Other

It It Has Nothing To Do With Cosmic Consciousness Or The Divine Self

Many People Interpret Buddha Nature Because Of Our Judeo Christian Background

We Somehow See What's Called Buddha Nature In Terms Of A Soul Or Something That Survives Death

Well The Fact Is In Life There's Buddha Nature

In Death There's Buddha Nature

Before Life And Death There's Buddha Nature

After Life And Death There's Buddha Nature

So Is Buddha Nature A Soul No

Both Buddha Nature And No Buddha Nature Exist In Life And In Death

As Well As Prior To Life And Death And After Life And Death

Before There Ever Was Scattering Of The Elements Movement And Stillness Being And Non-Being

There Has Always Been Buddha Nature And No Buddha Nature

It's Not A Metaphor It's Not An Image It's Not A Thought

Indeed Buddha Nature Is Not Like Anything

There's Nothing To Compare It With

But Don't Be Deluded

It Is Nothing Other Than What You Do Morning And Night

I've Added Footnotes

Priest Chang Shah Was Once Asked By The Government Secretary Do When You Chop An Earthworm Into Two Pieces Both Pieces Keep Moving

I Wonder In Which Piece Is The Buddha Nature

And The Footnote Says The Buddha Nature Is Chopped Into Which Piece Has The Worm

That's What Dogen Suggests Is A Much More Appropriate Way Of Expressing The Question

You Chop The Worm In Half

You Chop The Buddha Nature In Half

Which Half Has The Worm

You May Ask How Can You Chop Buddha Nature In Half

So I Ask How Do You Chop A Worm In Half

Chop Chopping The Worm In Half Implies That Once There Was One Worm And Now There Are Two Pieces To It

Yeah Dogen Says It Was Never One Nor Is It Two

If You Try To Understand This Language From Our Dualistic Reference System The Whole Thing Doesn't Make Sense At All

That's One Of The Virtues Of Koans They Force Us To Abandon That Referential Way Of Understanding Things And To See Directly Into The Truth

How Do You See Directly Into The Truth

You Have To Abandon The Notion Of A Self

That's Where Dogen's Coming From When He Speaks Of This

That's Where Chang Sha Is Coming From

That's Not Where The Secretary Do Is Coming From

So He Says When You Chop An Earthworm Into Two Pieces Both Pieces Keep Moving

I Wonder In Which Piece Is The Buddha Nature

Chang Sha Said Don't Have Illusory Thoughts

Footnotes To That Says How Nice But Will It Awaken Someone That Is Fast Asleep

I Mean It Doesn't Seem Like Much Of A Teaching

Don't Have Illusory Thoughts It's Nice It's True But Does It Impart Any Strength Does It Do Anything

And I Can Just Imagine Master Rinzai And This Secretary Which Piece Says The Buddha Nature

Rinzai Would Probably Have Driven Him Out With His Stick

And Probably The Secretary Would Have Had Rinzai's Head For It

That's Why He Wasn't A National Teacher

Next Line Do Said How Are We To Understand That They're Both Moving

He Persists Somehow

He's Associated Movement Now With Buddha Nature

Footnote To That Says See Where Is This All Leading To

He's Still In The Same Rut

Chang Sha's Don't Have Illusory Thoughts Has Had Absolutely No Effect On Him

He Just Goes On In The Same Rut

Chang Sha Then Said Understand That Air And Fire Are Not Yet Scattered

Footnote To That Said When It Does Scatter Where Will The Buddha Nature Be

Let's Assume That Earth Air Fire And Water All Separate

Where Is The Buddha Nature

The Great Culpa Fire At The End Of The Universe Completely Consumes Everything

Where Is The Buddha Nature

Master Totsetsu Said You Monks The Whole Point Of Your Training Was To Understand Your True True Nature Buddha Nature Right Here Now

Where Is Your Buddha Nature Show Me

And Then the Second Of his Three Barriers He Says If If If you Understand Your True Nature And Then You Will Surely Understand When you're About to Die Where it Will be At the Moment of Your death Of your Last breath Where is Where is The Buddha Nature

And then His third Barrier He said After you Die and the Four elements Are scattered To the Winds There's Nothing Left But dust

Where will The True Nature Be

Where will Your True Self Be

Where will Your Original Self Be

It's the Realization Of that Buddha Nature The Original Self That Finally He settles The question Of life And death And a lot Of other Questions Settles The questions Of the Dualities All of Them

So After he Said Understand That air And fire Not yet Scattered Do said Nothing

The footnote Says Did he get It Or is He just Thinking About It

The silence Could mean Many Things

I think It's Pretty Clear That when Chang Sha said Understand That air And fire Are not Yet scattered That what He was Addressing Is the Fact that How are To we To understand That they Are both Moving

Both of These sides Are moving Essentially What he's Saying In plain English Is They're Not dead Yet

So After Do said Nothing Chang Sha Called Out Secretary Do

Footnote Says Hey Wake Up Come Out Of Your Hole

And Do Responded Yes

Footnote To that Says Water In The Bucket Rice In The Bowl

Oh And He Called Do

Footnote Says Wake Up Come Out Of Your Hole

That Hole Is A Kind Of Restricted Vision Restricted Understanding That Do Has

We Refer To It In Many Ways In The Zen Literature We Call Blinders

Take Off The Blinders Set Down The Pack

The Blinders Are What Restricts Our Vision

There's No Peripheral Vision

It's Just The Road Straight Ahead

They Used To Do That For The Horses When I Was A Kid

All Of The Commercial Horses The Garbage Man And The Milk Man And The Iceman And The Police Van The Even UPS Used to Come With Horses And Wagons

That's How Old I Am

And All Those Horses Had These Blinders On

So They Weren't Distracted By Traffic And Other Horses And Things That Were Going On

They Could Only See The Road Ahead Of Them

Take Off The Blinders Open Up Your Vision

So You See The Whole Thing

Set Down The Pack

The Pack Is The Baggage

The Baggage That We Carry Around With Us All Of Our Lives

We We All Do It

We Start Off As Infants With Little Tiny Knapsacks

And As We Grow Up We Fill It

And As We Get Older We Need Bigger And Bigger Ones

And By The Time We're Adults We've Got These Huge Packs That We Carry Around

All The Stuff That We Hold On To

And Then We Figure There's Hope

We Find A Zen Practice Center

And Set Down The Knapsack

And We Put Another Pack On Our Back Dharma Pack

We Fill That With Buddhist Stuff That We Carry Around

It Seems That We've Got This Absolute Need To Go Through Life With A Pack On Our Back

We Create A New Set Of Blinders

They Become Dharma Blinders

The Only True Way Is The Buddha Way

Everything Else Sucks

Well One Is Just As Deluded As Another

Doesn't Matter Whether You've Got A Mercedes In Your Backpack Or A Buddha Image

The Very Fact That You're Carrying It Around On Your Back Means You're Still Carrying A Pack

And That's Why It's So Complicated

If It's All Pervading Reaching Everywhere

Why Is It That It Can't Be Understood Through Metaphor Thought Image

It's Precisely Because It Reaches Everywhere That It's Not Like Anything

That Is There's Nothing That It Can Be Compared To

There's Nothing That's Outside It To Compare It To

And That's Why It's Difficult To Realize

Because The Way We Go At It Is From The Point Of View Of Separation

Even In That Separation Is The Buddha Nature

Even In Our Most Deluded Thoughts Is The Buddha Nature

And Why Can't We Realize It

Buddha Nature Is Not Enlightenment

It's Not Something That Happens That You Get The Buddha Nature When You Become Enlightened

And It's Just As Present In Delusion

So What Is It

Where Is It

Right Now

Where Is Your Buddha Nature

These Are Important Questions

Questions Not Just Because Of Their Theoretical Value Or Because It's Good To Know About Buddhism

Because The Answers To Those Questions Are Transformative

They're They're They're They're They're Not About Gaining More Information

They're Not About A New Belief System

They're Not About Understanding

They're Transformative

They Change Your Way Of Perceiving Yourself And The Universe

And Once That Different Way Of Perceiving The Universe And Yourself Takes Place

Then Every Action Is A Manifestation Of The Wisdom And Compassion Of The Buddha

That's The Route

That's The Route

That's Been Taken By Tens Of Thousands Of Buddhist Men And Women Throughout History

2500 Years It's Been Going On

And That's The Route For Each One Of Us

It Can't Be Attained

It Can't Be Given

It Can't Be Received

It Can Only Be Realized
