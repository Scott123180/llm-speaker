Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:


I think one of the most important things about our training here that's been important to me since the very beginning of my practice here is the way we teach about and practice being a student. And I don't know if it's because of just having spent so many years in school as a student and sports and music and so on. And I think it's that and also realizing how much of that time I spent avoiding being a student in so many ways that it continues to show its head to me again and again and again, being a student and seeing it from different angles and different ways of understanding it. And it's, for me, incredibly alive. And it changes as my practice changes. And it's something that I feel really grateful for, that it's a part of this place the way it is. In fact, I feel like it's one of the most important things that we have here.

And I wanted today to spend a little bit of time looking at one aspect of that, one aspect of being a student. And I've titled this talk, Taking Risks, Failing, and Straight-Ahead Practice. I think one of the things that's incontestable about this practice about Zen is that it aims its sights very high. There are teachings and we take vows and we dedicate ourselves to letting go of all desires, to putting an end to suffering, to attaining liberation, to saving all sentient beings. I mean, those are not halfway kind of commitments. And the way we practice embodies that completeness. The way we do everything. We're constantly demanding ourselves, urging each other to constantly stay alert, to be present, to keep the mind focused. and that all of that isn't different at all from putting an end to desires or attaining liberation.

And it's the magnitude of that that I want to emphasize, that it's complete, that what we do, what we're doing here is saying, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to put an end to every desire. I'm going to attain complete freedom in my life. I'm going to resolve the question of death. They're very strong, far-reaching promises that we make to ourselves. In the Shobo Genzo, Dogen, in talking about, in the facile, ceaseless practice, Dogen's talking about how to do those things, how teachers in the past have gone about doing those things. Starting from the beginning, he says, the great teacher Shakyamuni began his Buddha life when he was 19. He did ceaseless practice deep in the mountains and at the age of 30 simultaneously attained the way with all sentient beings of heaven and earth.

And then until the age of 80, he did ceaseless practice in the mountains, forests, and monasteries and didn't return to his father's palace or pay attention to the affairs of state. He never spent even one hour alone. His entire life was ceaseless practice. And then he goes through a whole litany of ancestors. The 10th patriarch, Harishiba, neither slept nor lay down to rest for three years. He did this when he was 80. Master Basso did zazen for more than 20 years. Whenever there was temple work to be done, he was always the first. Even when he got very old, he didn't slack off. Ungan and Doyo, both studying under Yakuza, they made a vow not to lie down and kept that vow for 40 years. They were single-minded.

And we find ourselves here today getting up at four, sitting hour after hour, constantly being challenged to do what is for most of us at the beginning impossible to practice, ceaseless practice, to maintain the mind of zazen 24 hours a day. I remember when I began, I just thought, well, that's just not possible. It just can't be done. And there's constant demand to be present. And that that urging, that demand that we place is on each of us equally. You know, it's not qualified. Beginning students, sit over here, develop your concentration. Students sit in Shikantaza, working on Mu, break through, realize it. Those who are in the fourth, fifth, successive stages, develop that realization, manifest it. We don't do that. We just say, okay, everybody, realize it.

So can we do this? It's inevitable that the question comes up in our own mind. Session's a good time to ask that question. Can we put an end to all desires? Can we save all sentient beings? Can we attain freedom? Can we just simply keep our mind focused? Can we sit still? It may be different depending on where our practice is. For me, the fact that we're asked these things is important. It's terribly important. Because the way I hear that is that it means it is possible. Someone's done it. and I'm expected to do it. Putting myself in this room, putting on these robes. I'm saying, yes, I'm going to do that. And having that expectation placed on me, by me, helps.

I remember when I was in college in an orchestra. It was kind of a half-rate college orchestra, but there was a lot of heart in it. And our normal conductor was kind of half-rate, too. But he had a good heart, and he would make allowances for us a lot. And he would begin by saying, well, now this piece is kind of difficult. We're going to have to kind of work our way into it slowly. We may never be able to take it all the way up to tempo, but let's give it our best shot. People would make a mistake. He'd stop the whole rehearsal, go into great detail about how to work on it, maybe next week, maybe by the time the performance comes, you'll have ironed out those problems, et cetera, et cetera.

And a couple of times a year we had a guest conductor who was quite different. And he would just walk up and take the stick at the podium and say, okay, this is the piece we're playing and we're starting it at full pace, no mistakes. And then he would begin. No excuses, no allowances, no nice, safe margins. A mistake would happen, and he would stop and he would point you, next rehearsal, fix that. And then he would begin again. And the amazing thing was that there were two different orchestras for these two different conductors, two totally different orchestras that played totally different music. Same people. Why? So, what about meeting these great expectations of our practice? Maybe it's just a setup for failure. Is it a setup for failure? It's there for us to realize, to realize that it is possible.

Now, this life, the session. Does that mean that it denies the possibility of failure? No. Failure is real. And that's what I wanted to focus on. The thing that I love so much about this practice is that it takes the whole thing in, the whole spectrum of our condition as being human. The ugly and the beautiful, the brilliant and the dull, the dazzling and the mediocre. It not only accepts it and takes it in, but it says that's the Buddha nature. There's no distinction. Dazzling doesn't have five times as much Buddha nature as dull. And more than just embracing all of that, it invites us to become intimate with it. It invites us to become intimate with it in ourselves. To meet, eye to eye, our own humanity.

And it seems to me that this must be one of the most difficult parts of the practice. letting go of the misty dreams and the magical supernatural powers and just greeting our own humanity. The dull, dazzling. In the book Zen in America, I think, interviews with different Zen teachers, Tetsugan sensei talks about the process of working with the teacher and that as you become more and more intimate with this person with whom you go through everything, that basically that's what happens as you go along, as you become more and more aware of and intimate with that person's humanity. and he says that a lot of people just can't take that. It's not what we're looking for. We don't want that. We want something perfect. It is perfect actually. But we want our idea perfect and yet guaranteed if we had that we wouldn't hear, we wouldn't see.

So what about when we fail? It comes up a lot. We make sure it comes up a lot. Training doesn't even have to make sure it's just guaranteed. Sit down, focus on the breath, count to ten, don't let any thoughts come up. Fail. Don't succumb to sleepiness. Turn it around. Fail. Don't let anything get in the way. Be moo. 24 hours a day. Realize it. Not this session. So what about that? It's really about taking risks, isn't it? And it begins at the beginning. It begins with walking in the door. And you see that in people's faces. Fear, intimidation. Not knowing what's ahead. Knowing that something's ahead. But not knowing what. Great expectation.

Entering the Zen, though. You will sit still. You will do your best. You will do your best moment after moment. You will do that for yourself and for everyone else. Great expectation. Doing session. You are going to enter into something which may be the most difficult thing you have ever done. Ex-marines have said so. Great expectation. We are going to go into Doka-sana. We are going to show ourselves to the teacher. We are going to reveal ourselves and be vulnerable. We are going to practice Mu and we are going to be Mu. We are going to see what the Buddhas for all time have seen. Great expectation. We are going to be Shuso and lead the Sangha. Be an example of practice. We are going to give talks. We are going to be a monitor.

Who has the greatest risk? The teacher. The teacher takes more risks than all of us put together. The teacher knows that they are becoming intimately intertwined with other people's lives, with other people's karma. and that to do something, to really do something about changing those lives, they have to take chances. They have to stick their neck out. So where do we stick our necks out? I had to laugh last night when I was working on this talk. It was awful. It was not coming together. And I started about four or five different talks on totally different subjects. I had books all over the floor. I was feeling completely uninspired. And yet I wanted to talk about this. And I thought, well, maybe I'll give a talk on failure by failing to give a talk. But that was amusing for a minute, and then I realized I wasn't going to go for a fall.

Well, so taking risks, this constant potential. We're constantly facing the potential to fall short, to not meet our own expectation. And we learn early the cost. You know, we learn very, very early about taking risks, about sticking your neck out. I've told this story before, but it's one of my favorites, so I'll tell it again. I was in college, and first day of class with a teacher that I really wanted to impress because this guy was supposed to be dynamite. And he also had a reputation as being kind of heavy. And he was kind of just getting started, and he turned to the class and asked some question. I don't remember what it was. And he said, who will answer that question? And he looked out on the inevitable sea of blank faces, and I thought, you know, to hell with this. I'm not going to be intimidated by this guy, so I stuck up my hand, and he said, you answer this question. And I gave my answer, and he looked at me, and then he turned around and walked up to the chalkboard, picked up a piece of chalk and wrote a big zero.

And then he turned back and said, now who else would like to answer this question? And that keeps coming back to me, because I think that's it, you know, that's it in a nutshell, the big zero. Everybody sees it, everybody knows, cat's out of the bag. So we learn. We learn to either stick our necks out when we're right, when we know we're right, or we just be quiet, sink into the wall. Of course, in either of those cases, we're not taking any risks. What is risk? I looked it up in one of our greatest sources of dharma, the dictionary. And risk is defined as an exposure to possible loss. Who could say it any better? We could just say exposure, risk, is the possibility of exposure, God forbid. That's all we need to say, really.

Exposure of what? To whom? That's the question we ask ourselves. We need to ask ourselves. What do we protect? Who are we protecting it from? Possible loss, losing what? Is it that we're going to find out that we're really not as brilliant as we thought we were? Or is it that everyone else will really see who we are? And looking around, it seems like there's a lot of encouragement to take chances. You know, Rambo does it. Arnold Schwarzenegger does it. Lots of risk-taking going on. everybody loves the hero. It's filled, replete, throughout the literature in Zen. All the koans. The master spoke, the monk was enlightened. Hero. What about all of the people who didn't get it? what about all of the people who went back to their seats without the great illumination? Those are the ones I'm interested in.

Are they any different from us? Is the monk who heard the word and realized himself any different from us? So the message tends to be that, yeah, risk-taking is all right, but make sure that you're successful. We're not so interested in failure. But that's the only way. Intellectually, we know that. Intellectually, we know that we have to put our head on the block if we're going to do anything. It's just that way. But that doesn't always motivate us. And to come into a setting like this, this is very high risk. Particularly here, I don't know about other places, but I would consider this place extremely high risk. Great demands, great expectation. And for me, that is very important because it is possible.

So we have our stage. The risks are great. The stakes are high. It's about our life. It's about as high as you can get. And to tie it up, there are no guarantees, no promises, no assurances, no happy endings, necessarily. So how do we take that? How do we respond to that? How do we practice that? We may minimize risks. We can. You know, it still happens. It's unbelievable out what we learn when we're five. It just stays with us every month without question when I go in to do my part of the introductory weekend. Guaranteed, every back row will be filled, and if possible, front row is empty. But that's not what we're talking about here.

This question of failing, this reality of failing, it happens. How do we practice that? And what is it really when a thought arises, when we fall asleep, when the mind wanders, when we fall into doubt or anger or self-satisfaction? What are we failing at that moment? And how do we practice it? Who are we failing? We could call it straight ahead practice. Kyogen knew about straight ahead practice. We could say it's the single most powerful important force of our life. Out of that experience that Kyogen had, there's a koan in the Mumankan that says, Kyogen used to say to his monks, it's just like hanging from a tree. By your mouth. Your hands can't reach the branch, your feet can't reach the tree, and you're dangling.

And someone comes along at the bottom and says, Hey! What's the meaning of Bodhidharma's coming from the West? Someone comes along and says, Hey, help me. How do you respond then? Please don't see this as an abstract question. Zazen is straight ahead practice. Each and every single koan in existence is straight ahead practice. Dokasan is the place where we really learn, can learn about failure through the course of study 5, 10, 15, 20 years. How many times do we fail in Dokasan? And what is failing? If it's making the mark, passing the test, then we have failure and success and we have an abstraction. That's not what's going on in there. That's not what's going on in here.

Kinhin is straight ahead practice. The way we practice kinhin is exactly the way Kyogen's person hanging from the tree responds. It's the way we deal with an impossible situation because you see there's nothing more powerful than the practice of kinhin. The way you do kinhin is the way we live a life. It's that that brings us eye to eye with the Buddhas. It's so simple. It's so incredibly powerful. Nothing stops that. There is no one who can stop that. there is no limit when we're practicing just kinhin. What is kinhin? It's this incredible challenge. It's very simple. It's very quiet. And it is utterly inescapable. And once we realize that inescapability then the way is clear truly clear.
