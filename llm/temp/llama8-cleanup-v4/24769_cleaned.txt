Giving generously means non-greed, not withholding. One phrase, one verse, the ten thousand things, the hundred grasses. One dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors. Since the beginningless beginning, there has never been a single thing to withhold.

When the Way is relinquished to the Way, the Way is realized. When the Way is realized, the Way is manifested through itself. When the Self gives the Self simply for the sake of giving, the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving. The cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth.

How can this truth be realized? Listen to this old teaching, the main case. A monk asked the Great Pearl, By what means can the gateway of our school be entered? By means of Dhanaparamita, the Great Pearl said.

The monk said, according to the Buddha, The Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas. Why then have you mentioned only one? The Great Pearl said, Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita, and that by its practice all the others are fulfilled.

The monk said, why is it called Dhanaparamita? The teacher said, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment. It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad, being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void, concentration and distraction, pure and impure. By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

The capping verse. You may understand it, but in vain. You may believe it, but it's to no avail. You may describe it, but it still remains a description. Ultimately, how is it? The river doesn't understand, yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean. The mountain has no words, yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things. It is here that the sweet innocence of Dana is revealed.

As most of you, as I look around the room, I realize that most of you have been here for the weekend, so you were part of the whole Dana thing yesterday. But there are also some that weren't here, so some of what I did as opening remarks to the Dana Paramita, or the Perfection of Giving weekend, and I'd like to repeat so that it's clear to everyone.

Dana, we translate, for those of you that are new to the term, as giving. Although giving doesn't quite reach it. It's more than just something going from A to B. It's the same as in the transmission of the Dharma. We call it Dana Paramita, and Paramita means the practice of perfection, or crossing over to the other shore. And these Paramitas are part of Mahayana Buddhism. And in Zen, we understand the crossing over to the other shore as either the other shore and this shore are the same, or rather the other shore arrives.

So, Dana Paramita is understood loosely as the Perfection of Giving. And as all of you must have realized yesterday in the process of doing that weekend, that the teachers of this weekend were really the people that arrived on the buses. It would be, you'd have to be totally blind and without any sensibility at all not to have received an incredible amount of teaching from our guests the weekend. And that's at the heart of what Dana is about, there can be no Dana unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously. That's the heart of Dana. It goes both ways. It must go both ways.

There can be no Dana unless the giver and the receiver are unified or become one reality in the process. So, therefore, Dana is not charity. It's not generosity. It's not almsgiving or donations. or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction or contribution, gift, philanthropy, offering. Dana is the practice of total relinquishment. And that's what the great pearl was talking about. Total relinquishment, letting go, not holding on to anything. All the dualities must dissolve.

And needless to say, when all the dualities dissolve, each of those paramitas, each of the six paramitas are there. Dana, or giving, or the perfection of giving, is found throughout the Mahayana literature. It appears in the precepts. For example, be generous, do not be withholding. That's Dana. It appears in the eight awarenesses of an enlightened person, the 52 aspects of a bodhisattva. It appears in the paramitas. It appears as part of the morality, the three basic teachings of the Buddha, one of which was morality.

So, it's obviously considered by Buddhists to be one of the most important virtues. It is the characteristic of a bodhisattva. It's the life of a bodhisattva. And in the prologue, it says, giving generously means non-greed. And if you really look at greed, you realize that greed is exactly the opposite. Greed is about holding on. And dhana is about letting go, not withholding, not holding back.

And then the prologue says, one phrase, one verse, ten thousand things, the hundred grasses, one dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors, since the beginning. There has never been a single thing to withhold. So, that's the ultimate truth that underlies the whole thing.

We may proceed through the world with an illusion of separateness, with the illusion that the self and other are separate things. But the fact is, there is no separation to begin with. That's why we call dharma, the ten thousand things, purity itself. There's nothing extraneous. There's no outside. It's all unified, whether we've realized it or not.

If we haven't realized it, and we proceed on the assumption that there's a self and other separation, then we run into all kinds of difficulties. And that's what the pain and suffering of this life is about. That's what we call samsara. So, if you haven't realized it, although it's true, you're not going in accord with that realization. When you realize it, or when you practice in accord with the truth of that unity, then it's a whole different way of living your life.

There has never been a single thing to withhold. Because each one of us, this very body and mind, your very body and mind, is the body and mind of the universe. Where would you hold it? And who would you give it to?

And then the prologue says, when the way is relinquished to the way, when you give the way to the way, the Tao, to the Tao, the way is realized. When the way is realized, the way is manifested through itself. So, the way begins to manifest itself through itself when you've realized the way.

What does it mean to have realized the way? It means to have unified with the way. When you are the way itself, the way manifests through itself, which is none other than manifesting through you. That's what the next line means.

When the self gives the self simply for the sake of giving, the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving. Again, that's about unification, no separation. There's no reason for it. There's no merit attached to it. It's simply the way the universe is. And so, the giving is simply for the sake of giving, for no other reason.

Like, you can wash the dishes in order to have clean dishes. That makes it functional. There's a purpose. There's a process and there's a result. Or, you can wash the dishes to wash the dishes. Just for the simple sake of washing the dishes.

So, the cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth. That is, it is the nature of things. Whether we've realized it for ourselves or not, it's the nature of things.

This monk, in the main case, comes up to the great pearl. And the great pearl is the successor of Matsu, the great master Basa who had 84 enlightened disciples that he transmitted to. Hui Hai is one of those disciples. His name in in Japanese is Daishu. Daishu means great pearl.

Ikai. He got the name great pearl because he first began studying with, he was first ordained by another teacher and then went to study with Matsu and studied with him for a while and then his first teacher became very ill and so he left Matsu and went back to take care of his old teacher and while he was back there he wrote a discourse and I'm trying to remember what that discourse was.

I guess it was a discourse on sudden elimination and a monk who was there took that treatise to Matsu and when Matsu read it he said there is a great pearl on that mountain and although he had the name Ikai it was the name Daishu or great pearl that kind of stuck with him so this monk asked the great pearl by what means can the gateway of our school be entered and he answered by means of Dhanaparamita.

This koan is not a koan in the usual sense of the word it tends to be very explanatory and I think the reason is is that it arose from a mondo rather than a dharma combat shosan dharma combats tend to be more direct pointing more head squeezing mondos tend to be intellectual and explanatory and this is kind of intellectual and explanatory but it has some value because of his particular way of expressing it that I thought was important for us to use and to treat it as a koan so he says by means of Dhanaparamita so the monk said according to the Buddha the bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas why then have you mentioned only one and the great pearl said deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita and it's by the practice by its practice the practice of giving that all the others are fulfilled.

In a sense you can say that for any of the paramitas you can say that from any of the precepts you can say that for the eight gates of Zen that in each one of them the other are contained and if you realize any one of them fully you've realized that in fact you can say that of any koan that if you exhaust the koan completely thoroughly all of the ramifications and permutations and combination of a single koan you've realized all of the koans.

Then the monk says why is it called dana paramita and he answers dana means relinquishment relinquishment of what relinquishment of the dualism of opposites it means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad the being and non-being love and aversion void and non-void concentration and distraction pure and impure by giving all of them up we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.

Now we've talked about this a hundred thousand times in the fifteen years we've been here these so called opposites that every one of them are two parts of the same reality that because they are mutually arising because they're codependent that is one cannot exist without the other we can choose to see them as opposite but we can also see them as codependent.

When these two merge there can no longer be attachment there's nothing to attach to and no one to do the attaching that's what love is no separation that's what caring is no separation that's what dhana is no separation that's what realization is no separation whether we're talking about people or sound or form that's what Dogen meant when he said seeing form with the whole body and mind one understands it intimately hearing sound with the whole body and mind one understands it intimately.

That intimacy is realization it's unity it's one thing so we call it letting go non-attachment forget the self empty the mind no mind non-dual dharma merging of differences wonderful but how do you get there well you know you can recite it in your head a hundred thousand times and try desperately to do it and you know you can you can do it you know empathy is a kind of a practice in that direction but keep in mind empathy with someone is still separation it's not yet unity that's the difference between doing good and compassion and doing good there's still separation and compassion there's no sense of doer or the person that's being done self and other or act of doing it just happens spontaneously the way the spring breeze warms the earth it doesn't know what it's doing the earth doesn't know about the spring breeze.

So how do we do it well no matter how you cut it in this practice no matter where you look to it no matter what the teachings are if we're talking about liturgy or the precepts or art practice body practice koans whatever it is it all comes down to the old furnace of zazen the process of falling away of body and mind and we begin that process by working with the body and then with the breath and then the mind and as the process gets deeper and the body falls away off sensation of the body mind is still functioning you know you're there you're watching the breath you're feeling the breath and then you disappear into the breath the breath is just breathing itself there's no longer an observer watching.

Mind falls away that's what Dogen meant in that little those few little lines that encompasses the totality of our practice to study the Buddha way is to study the self you start with all the stuff all the stuff that we call our self the bag of skin everything inside it is me and everything outside it is the rest of the universe that's the illusion and we start with that illusion and study it and layer by layer we begin digging at it the layers of conditioning conditioning of parents teachers culture education peers conditioning that began at birth and has continued through our life and is constantly reinforced day after day by our media and our literature and our politics and sociology and science and religion constantly reinforces the illusion of separateness of two things.

We work with that layer by layer examining it and letting it go till we get to that ground of being we learn the practice of letting go moment to moment in Zazen that's why it's so critical seems simple you know thought comes up let it go come back to the practice well what you're learning is how to let go and there's nothing as sweet or as juicy as our own thoughts we love them we hang on to them all the beautiful fantasies all the beautiful ideas all the brilliant words it's hard to let go of them non attachment doesn't mean abandoning them it means not attaching not holding on.

And layer by layer we let go we get to that ground of being so to study the self is to forget the self once you get rid of all of the aggregates what is it that remains when the self is forgotten what is it that remains Dogen says it in the next line to forget the self is to realize the 10,000 dharmas when you forget the self what remains when there's no longer a self is the 10,000 dharmas is everything the whole universe but there's no longer a barrier between you and it you are it the skin bag either has embraced the totality of it or has just disappeared however you look at it doesn't matter there's merging merging is even extra there's the realization that there never was a separation.

And in each aspect of those 10,000 8 stages of 8 gates of practice that same thing is functioning non-dual so in the face-to-face teaching no separation is at the heart of it in our academic study not attaching to the words our tendency in academic study is to want to hold on to the words we need to read it hear it throw it away and keep going even in practice we need to realize it throw it away and keep going whatever it is.

And ultimately we come to the peak of the mountain enlightenment realize it throw it away and keep going if you hold on to anything you've created that dualism again so that's why we emphasize not only material things even spiritual things if you hold on to it you create an illusion of separateness and it's diluted liturgy is also the process of giving we constantly give in liturgy our gratitude our appreciation for the teachings we receive the teachings we give the gratitude the precepts are another example of that non-dual dharma no-self they're based on no-self they're based on no-self and designed to function in the world of differences that's what I mean you can't you can't deny existence the Buddha way is beyond being and non-being it doesn't fall into either side of it in art practice the same thing the brush paints itself body practice the dance dances itself.

And all of these self is forgotten but one of the things that's going to be happening soon we're coming to our 15th anniversary and we've also just received notification recently that the monastery building and its grounds has been recognized by New York State as a historical site and it's also been recognized nationally as a national historic site and this will give us an opportunity to do fundraising to restore this building to do a major restoration project as well as other things that we need and so we'll be launching a capital campaign a major fund drive.

And I just want to say to the people who are going to be doing this fund drive that if it's going to be charity it's not going to work if it's going to be generosity it's not going to work or beneficence or donation or contribution or gift or philanthropy it's not going to work the people that will give must also receive otherwise it's not dana very important so the question is to really make clear both sides of that form is emptiness emptiness is form form is exactly emptiness emptiness exactly form that's the same with all dualities.

The capping verse you may understand it but it's all in vain you may believe it but it's to no avail you may describe it but it still remains a description ultimately how is it the river doesn't understand and yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean the mountain has no words yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things it is here that the sweet innocence of dana is realized.

You see that in children that sweet innocence of giving that's the way it should be.
