Well, we've begun this morning our 1990 Fall Ango. And all of you who have offered incense and entered this Ango will be practicing it in many different ways. At home, here in the monastery, in the mountains, in the city, in your work, you're raising children, maintaining a household, doing zazen, seshin, all of those different ways are different ways of manifesting a little bit away. There are no gaps. We tend to think of the monastery as being some kind of a sanctuary separate and distinct from the rest of our lives, but it's not so.

And what realization is about is realizing that there are no gaps. The whole process of practice is a continuum, no gaps. Practice isn't something that you do at some special time or in some special place. It's home. It's the process of our life. It's everything that we do. But it requires a kind of consciousness and awareness in the doing. It requires simply being present in the moment.

Ango literally means peaceful dwelling. And we tend to consider that peaceful dwelling as the pure, genuine, great ocean gathering of the Sangha. But Ango is each one of us as much as it is the Sangha. There's no distinction between those two things. In fact, there's no distinction between the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. That is, between enlightenment, the teachings, and the practice. No gaps.

This afternoon we'll be with Enkya leading, climbing Mount Trempa. That's a tradition that's been going on for hundreds of years. Dogen used to climb Eheji Mountain. And after his death, each Ango at Eheji, all of the monks participating in that Ango would climb the Eheji Mountain. And so we follow that practice. And in doing so, we plug into that continuum. In practicing Ango, we plug into a continuum that goes back 2,500 years to the time of the Buddha. The first of the peaceful gatherings.

And for generation after generation, in all of the schools of Buddhism, there's an equivalent of that Ango. Keep in mind, all the while, that peaceful dwelling is the way you live your life. It's the way you practice your life. It's not something that's going to happen to you. It's not something that someone's going to give you.

This morning, I finally found a moment to really read and appreciate the book that I received from the Sangha. And on each page was some expression of each person. And it just filled me. It filled me with strength. It filled me with joy. It nourished me deeply. And I know through the years it will continue to nourish me. And what that nourishment means is it's given me the power to return it to you. And as I do and deplete myself, I get it back from you. And you do it with each other. That's what Sangha is about.

Every time we engage in a liturgy in an expression of appreciation to the ancestors, what we do is return what we receive so that that cycle stays complete. There are no gaps. There are no gaps unless we create them. And when we create the gaps, that's when the thing goes off. It's the same thing in a relationship. You can't just take. There needs to be the giving. And when the giving and taking are in harmony, the circle's complete. It's peaceful. It's harmonious. It's nourishing.

It's the same with our environment, with this great earth itself. You see what's happening when we just take. We also need to give back. We do it with the mountain. I've mentioned many times before as we live on this mountain, we consume it. We eat it. We digest it. It becomes part of our body. Its water is in our cells. The atoms and molecules that were once the soil and the rock produced the food that we digest and the waste products we return to it and the cycle continues on and on.

But that cycle of no gaps doesn't only happen here. Today, when you climb that mountain and you get up on top of it and you look down at this beautiful valley and the Ashokan Reservoir, keep looking. Look beyond the reservoir. In the distance, there'll be a haze. That's the city. That, too, is to be practiced, just like this mountain is to be practiced. That haze also is to be practiced. It's your haze and my haze. We put it there.

It's only in that intimacy and taking full responsibility for everything that we complete that cycle of no gaps. And so when this ceremony is over and we come down from the mountain and everybody disperses into the ten directions, the practice is not over. It's just starting. And whether it's going on in your bedroom, in your kitchen, on your job, or driving a car on this mountain, it's all the same practice. There's no gaps.

The transmission that's been going on for 2,500 years, we tend to think of it only as a transmission mind to mind, from teacher to teacher. But it's a transmission of all of it. It's a transmission of entanglements as well as clarity. It's a transmission of the Buddhas, the Dharma, and the Sangha. And when we gather here like this and practice together, we close the gap. The transmission is complete.

When you practice at home in what you're doing, you close the gap. The practice is complete. So when in the mountain, we practice the mountain. When in the city, we practice the city. And what does that mean? It means really being with what you're doing. When I walk in the woods, I walk slowly. Each step feels its way. The movement is quiet and soft. I listen. I smell. I look. I feel.

When I walk in the city, the pace is faster. It's brisk. There's a lot of vigor in it. That's the way the city moves. That's its pulse. I become part of that pulse. But I still look. I still see. I still feel. I still hear. The teachings are all around us. They're not just in the mountains. The Brooklyn Bridge is as much a work of nature as the spider web. We should appreciate it all and not separate ourselves from it all.

And it's in that non-separation that we're able to nourish it, to heal it. Unless you feel it and taste it, there's nothing you can do about it except wring your hands. But once it becomes intimate part of you, it takes on a whole different meaning, a whole different feeling in the way you relate to it, the way you appreciate it, the way you nourish it, what you do for it becomes very different.

There too, there is the receiving and the giving. And when they're in harmony, no gaps, the circle is complete. This ango, as our tradition has it here on Mount Tremper, the fall ango is usually an ango of lay practice. The emphasis is on lay practice. And the head seminarian is a lay practitioner. But as I mentioned before, lay practice, monk practice, sacred, secular, monastery, world, are all one reality.

And so we should support the issue so and support ourselves in so doing in this 90 days of intensive practice. Everything you put into it comes right back. In our work practice, we dig a ditch. At the end of that work practice, there's a ditch that we needed for something. In the process of doing that, something is received and something is given. That's practice. Practice is doing. That's training. Training is doing.

When we're really intimate with our practice and our training, we're intimate with the whole phenomenal universe, which is not but the self. So please use these days well. Use them at home. Make what you do conscious. That's all. That's practice. Consciously wash the dishes. Not just to have clean dishes, but to just simply wash the dishes to wash the dishes.

Being with someone just for the sake of really being with them, not to get something or even to give something, just to simply be there with the whole body and mind. Same with our work, regardless of what your work is. If you can't have the heart to give it all of your intimacy, everything you've got, then you're in the wrong job. Change your job. Find something that you can give your whole body and mind to in the way you do it.

If we all did that, it would be such a wonderful, wonderful way for this world to be. It's not like that. Probably will never be like that. But for you and for me, we make it that way by the way we live our life. The decision is yours. The choice is yours. You have the power to do it. You have the same power that every Buddha and every ancestor, every sage from time immemorial have had. It's there whether you recognize it or not.

And in practicing, no gap, you put yourself in touch with what's always been there, with what's your birthright. So please take care of it. That's the great matter of Buddhists and ancestors. That's what peaceful dwelling is about. Let's make this the strongest hunger we've had yet. May your life go well. Thank you.
