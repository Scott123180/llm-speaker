A Book of Equanimity, Case 91, Nonsense Peony, Preface to the Assembly. Yang Shan takes dream for a reality. Nan Quan points to wakefulness as unreal. If one knows that wakefulness and dreaming are fundamentally non-existent, for the first time, one will see unreality and reality are absolute. But tell me, what eye does this person have?

The main case. Officer Lu Geng said to Nan Quan, teaching Master Zhao was quite extraordinary. He was able to say heaven and earth have the same root. Myriad things are one body.

Nan Quan pointed to a peony in the garden and said, People today see this flower as if in a dream.

The verse. Shining through detachment and subtlety, the root of creation. Appearing and disappearing in profusion, you see the gate. Letting the spirit roam outside of time, what question could there be? Setting the eyes before the body, you know, in effortable being.

When the tiger roars, blowing on the cliff starts moaning. When the dragon howls, moving clouds or the caves are dark. Nan Quan breaks up the dream of people of the time, wanting knowledge of the magnificent, honored one to be.

This day, this spring day, a lot of things come together for us here on Zen Mountain. It's the founding day of this monastery some eleven years ago. Actually, it was on Good Friday in 1980 that we first discovered this mountain and its buildings. And today is also the Easter, Easter Sunday, the celebration of the resurrection of Christ celebrated by most of the Christians. Also Passover celebration of the liberation of the Jews from bondage in Egypt. Next week, although in a sense we can celebrate it today too, is Buddha's birthday. All of these wonderful things coming together in spring, a time of renewal. It's no wonder that we call realization or enlightenment the endless spring.

Resurrection day, liberation day, founding day, birth day, death day, not a single moment in between. Spring is in the frozen branches buried beneath three feet of snow. The fragrance of a single shad blossom fills the ten directions. What words can reach such a place? There is no holding back spring. When it arrives, it is truly here.

Spring is in the frozen branches buried beneath three feet of snow. That's the endless spring I speak of. The endless spring has nothing to do with this and that. The endless spring has nothing to do with the seasons. And in the frozen branches buried beneath the snow, spring is there. That spring is the spring that's in the life of each one of us. Realized or not. Some may realize it, some may not. That's what Dogen means when he says practice and enlightenment are one.

Each one of us is the perfection and completeness of the Tathagata, of the Buddha. Each one of us is lacking nothing, right from the very beginning lacking nothing. The fragrance of a single shad blossom fills the tender excellence. The single thing reaching everywhere. What is the single thing that reaches everywhere? What words can describe such a state of being, state of mind? That's what Nansen is addressing in here.

There's no holding back spring. When it arrives, it's truly here. What does that mean? It means rice in the bowl, carrots in the soup. It means that this very everyday ordinary existence that each one of us experiences every day is that perfection that's the life of a Buddha, of a realized being. It's the holding up of the cabbage leaf and manifesting the 16 foot golden body of the Buddha that Dogen speaks of.

If our practice isn't about the world, isn't about our everyday existence, then what's it for? Why do we do it? In the preface to the assembly, it's said that Yongshan takes dream for reality. Nanquin points to wakefulness as unreal. Are these two masters speaking of opposite things?

Yongshan, some of you may remember, had a dream. He had a dream that he went to Maitreya's place and was given the third seat. Maitreya is the Buddha of the future. And a venerable monk got up and struck the gavel and said today's talk will be given by the monk of the third seat. Maitreya got up, mounted the podium, struck the gavel and said the Dharma of the Tathagata transcends all words all words all speech transcends the thousand ways of expressing it. Listen. Listen carefully. And he descended the seat.

So that was Yongshan in his dream showing the reality of the Tathagata. With a couple of monitors, crack some of these windows and let the air in here, we're running out of oxygen and I think everybody's coughing. Also get to hear the birds.

If one knows that wakefulness and dreaming are fundamentally non-existent, for the first time one will see unreality and reality are absolute. So wakefulness and dreaming are fundamentally non-existent. What does that mean?

During this weekend when we were discussing the teachings of the insentient, we address the question of the Yogicara school of Buddhism, the mind-only school. And in Buddhism it's said that reality as we know it, as we experience it, has to do with the mind or consciousness, the organ of perception and the object of perception coming together. These codependent entities that when all three of those things come together we have what we call reality, that which is real.

So my eye and the thing that my eye sees form and consciousness together create the reality of that form. If I remove the eye, although the form is there and consciousness is there, I don't see it. I remove the form, although the eye is there and consciousness is there, I can't see the form. I remove consciousness, although the eye is there and the form is there, I don't see it.

That falling away of consciousness is what we call samadhi, single pointedness of mind, no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, like you chant in a heart sutra. No color, sound, smell, taste, touch, phenomena. No world of sight, no world of consciousness. That's the absolute basis of reality.

Now it's kind of interesting in Buddhism, there are not only the five senses that we recognize in the West, but a sixth sense, and that sixth sense is mind. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Mind is an organ of perception just like the eye and the ear. And the object of that organ of perception of mind is thought. So mind, thought, consciousness together create reality just as real as any other reality.

So when you dream, you go through all sorts of things in a dream. Bad dream, being chased by someone. The whole body and mind reacts to that. You break out into a sweat, your body is trembling, you're out of breath from running, and yet you've never left your bed. And there you are, panting, sweating, trembling, and suddenly you wake up and you say to yourself, oh, that was a dream. That was just a dream. It was only my mind that was doing that.

Well, it's only your mind that's doing this right now. We create the whole universe with our mind. We create existence and non-existence with our mind. That's why he says unreality and reality are absolute. When you are the thing itself, it no longer exists. The self no longer exists. That's what it means to be the barrier. With the whole body and mind be the barrier. The barrier is the koan, be the koan. The barrier is fear, be the fear. The barrier is pain, be the pain.

When you are the pain, the pain fills the whole universe. There's nothing outside of it. And it's the same. There's no pain at all. You need a reference system to have pain. When you are the thing itself, there is no reference system. There is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. There's no thought, perception, color. There is no self, there is no other.

Officer Lugen said to Nung Kwan, teaching Master Zhao was quite extraordinary. He was able to say, heaven and earth have the same root. Myriad things are one body. Wonderful statement. Nung Kwan pointed to a peony in a garden and said, people today see this flower as if in a dream. What was he talking about? Was he approving or disapproving?

Officer Lugen. Officer Lugen was a official of very high statue in Kang Dynasty China at the time of Nansen. He was a member of their Supreme Court and he was a student of Zen, student of Nansen. And the first time he saw Nansen, when he first started studying with Nansen, one day he said to Nansen, I've raised a goose in a bottle and gradually it grew too big to get out. Now without damaging the bottle or injuring the goose, how will you get it out? Nansen called to him, Lugen. Lugen responded, yes, Nansen said, it's out. Lugen at that point realized himself, experienced awakening.

Now this story that's taking place here is taking place a little bit further down the line. Lugen continued his study with Nansen, Nankuin. Nankuin is the Chinese pronunciation, Nansen Japanese pronunciation, trying to clarify his understanding. And he was studying the treatises of Master Zhao, a treatise called Nirvana Has No Name. And in a section called Wondrous Existence, it says, the mysterious way is ineffable enlightenment. Enlightenment is in merging with reality.

Merging with reality involves seeing existence and non-existence as equal. And when you see them equally, then other and self are not two. Therefore, heaven, earth, and I have the same root. The myriad things and I are one body. Being the same as me, they are no longer existent nor non-existent. If they were different from me, that would oppose communication. Therefore, neither going out nor being within, the way subsists in between.

Lugeng quoted these two lines as being wonderful. He wasn't realizing when he was quoting them that this was speaking of a dream within a dream. This same piece of work, the same treatise, was read by Master Sikito. Sikito, on reading it, was awakened when he reached the point where it says the ultimate person is empty and hollow. They have no form, yet the myriad things, of the myriad things, there is none that's not his own making.

Who can understand the myriad things as oneself? Only a sage. And then upon realizing himself, he said, a sage has no self, yet there is nothing that's not themselves. Then he wrote the sutra that we chanted this morning, the identity of absolute and relative, the merging of differences, absolute on one side, relative on the other side. Neither contains the truth.

Our tendency, when we come into practice, we come in filled with the whole world of differentiation, what we call illusion. We take it as real. And it's exactly that confusion that creates the pain and suffering. That confusion is based on the idea that the self is separate and distinct from everything else in the universe. And it's not. That's an idea.

And then somehow through practice, little by little, we work our way through those layers and layers of conditioning and ultimately reach that ground of being. Dogen says, to study the Buddha way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. As you get through those layers of conditioning, you finally realize that that's all the self is, is those layers of conditioning, an idea.

So to study the self is to forget the self. And to forget the self is to be enlightened by the ten thousand things. Think about it. What happens when there's no longer a self? People worry about that. What's going to happen if I forget the self? What's going to happen to my life? What's going to happen to my sex life? Will I like things anymore? Will I have any feelings anymore?

What remains when the self is forgotten? Everything. The whole catastrophe. The whole phenomenal universe remains. The only thing that's gone is the idea that separates you from everything. That's what it means to forget the self is to be enlightened by the ten thousand things. It means to be the ten thousand things.

But it doesn't end there. To be one with the ten thousand things is to fall away, body and mind. To be one with the ten thousand things is no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. What will you do with no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind? How will you cook a meal, cross the street, drive a car, raise a child, make love?

So the journey continues. Top of the mountain is not the end of the journey, not in this practice. So what do you do when you've reached the peak of the mountain? How do you continue? What do you do next? Straight ahead. You go straight ahead. And straight ahead when you're on the peak means down the other side, back into the world, right back where you started from.

Until that which has been realized, has been actualized in everything you do. This practice is not complete. That's what Dogen was pointing to in the teachings of the chief cook. That's what Nansen is pointing to here. His venerable student is making a living in a ghost cave. Heaven and earth have the same root, the myriad things are one body.

Nansen says people see this flower as if in a dream. This same koan is taken up in the Blue Cliff Record. Blue Cliff Record is another collection of koans that's used in Rinzai school. And again it's taken up in Book of Equanimity which is a koan collection that's held in high regard in the Soto school. So both these schools consider this particular koan of Nansen a really important one. It's one of my favorites.

It was the koan that I used when I was Shuso. Setsuo says the ultimate person is empty and hollow without form yet none of the myriad things are not his own doing. Who can understand that the myriad things are one's own self? Everything. The whole phenomenal universe. The whole way that we experience ourselves has to do with the way we use our mind.

When you really see that it changes your whole way of relating to the world. First thing that happens is a real deep and complete sense of responsibility. Very powerful. Because when you really understand that you are the creator there's no way you can avoid taking responsibility for everything. It's your universe. Not only responsibility for what happens to you. That's the most obvious part of it.

You can no longer say he made me angry. You realize that only you can make you angry. And when you realize only you can make you angry you empower yourself to do something about anger. When you haven't realized that you just go on for the rest of your life blaming and being a victim. He made me angry. It's his fault.

That taking responsibility is very powerful. But it's for the whole catastrophe not for what's just happening to you. It's taking responsibility for the burning oil fields in Kuwait. For the children starving in Africa. For what's going on in South America. For what's happening in the ozone layer. This whole blessed universe is none other than the body and mind of the Buddha. The body and mind of all sentient beings.

Now there are two aspects to this teaching. One is its absolute basis and the other is how that absolute basis informs the world of phenomena. And if you take the teachings as the ultimate principle, as the absolute basis, then why did Shakyamuni Buddha hold up a flower? Why did he hold up a flower? Because it's not a thing. It's not a thing. It's not a thing.

This is not a religion of belief. Not to just believe the teachings of the Buddha. This is not a religion of the words and ideas that describe reality. To make it their own. Realize it. Then there's no separation. When you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha.

National teacher Shan held up his fly whisk and said all things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, reflections. Szechio, in his commentary on this, says mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror. If you say that they're seen in a mirror and only then illuminated, then they are not apart from where the mirror is.

Mountains and rivers, the great earth, plants, trees, forests, do not use a mirror to observe them. If you use a mirror to observe them, you make them into two parts. Just let mountains be mountains and rivers be rivers. Everything abides in its normal state. Mountains and rivers are not seen in a mirror. Then tell me, where can you see them?

Do you understand? Seeing in a mirror is reflecting it. In intimacy, there's no reflection. That's what this practice is about, intimacy. It begins with intimacy with a breath. Be the breath. It continues with intimacy with the ten thousand things.

But you can't be intimate if you're clinging to this bag of skin as a thing that's separate and distinct from everything else. We lock ourselves into this bag of skin and in so doing we lock out the whole universe, the whole thing, the whole wondrous, beautiful catastrophe that it is coming down on all sides of us.

Spring is not out there. Birds are not out there. There is no outside nor is there an inside. In the verse it says, shining through detachment and subtlety, the root of creation. Appearing and disappearing in profusion, you see the gate. The gate is the entranceway.

Letting the spirit roam outside of time, what question could there be? Setting the eyes before the body, you know, ineffable being, when a tiger roars blowing on the cliff starts, when the dragon howls moving clouds over the caves are dark, nonsense breaks up the dream of people of the time, wanting knowledge of the magnificent, honored one to be.

The myriad things are one body. The root and the body produce the myriad things in heaven and earth. Keep in mind that first there is someone who doesn't sleep, then there is sleep. Because of not awakening from sleep, there are dreams. By dreams, scenes are seen. Based on these scenes, you see existence of another body applying discernment within the scenes.

When you know, when you realize the one who never sleeps, all these complications are avoided. What is the one that never sleeps? What is the root of all things? What root? The ten thousand things, heaven and earth, have the same root. Root, what is that root? What body do they have in common?

You should take the whole thing, the whole catastrophe, very seriously and very personally. Very, very personally. This great earth, its mountains, its rivers, they're all very personal. Rice in the bowl, carrots in the soup. Take it personally, very, very personally.

Very personally means intimate. It's only in intimacy that the voice of the insentient can be heard. Can you hear it? If not, then listen. Really listen. And tell me, right now, how is it? Keep in mind that your practice is always right now. Keep in mind that there is only right right now.

Don't miss it. It's your life. It's your life.
