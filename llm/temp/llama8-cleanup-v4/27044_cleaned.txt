We would also like to express to you our gratitude for the moment of our good practice. All I can say is thank you, DiRoshi, for showing us yourself in a great way. We would next ask Maezumi Roshi for his remarks of gratitude.

Thank you. Thank you. We are supposed to express our thanks to all of you. To the almost full degree that it has been already said. And I think we have perceived a word to express our thanks. I feel simply not enough. That's clever. I appreciate all the heart, the mind, the body that each of you have. have, really appreciated by yourself or by without self, like mountains and rivers. That would be our best way to express our gratitude and thanks to all of you.

Other than that, the value expression of my gratitude, or you are what your gratitude and thanks may not mean much. Thank you for your presence here at this day. To do that, we could finish this wonderful ceremony together. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
