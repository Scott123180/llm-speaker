Here is the reformatted transcript with paragraph breaks:


Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Welcome to Zan Mountain Monastery. And I was in training a weekend. The great master Dogen, in teaching his assembly, said, He said, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. And he said the meaning of these words is not that mountains are mountains, but that mountains are mountains. And then he said we should thoroughly study these mountains. To thoroughly study the mountains is the mountain training. And these mountains and rivers themselves spontaneously become wise ones and sages.

This weekend is about the mountain training, Zan Mountain training. This weekend we'll be looking at the training matrix that we have here at Zan Mountain Monastery. We'll be looking at it through lectures, questions and answers, discussion. But most important of all, we'll be doing it experientially. So the things that we talk about and we discuss, you'll have an opportunity to experience, to try it on, see how it works.

Zen Buddhism, like all of the forms of Buddhism, traces its beginnings back to the Buddha, Shakyamuni. Many of you are probably already familiar with his life. Basically it's the life of, recorded in Siddhartha, the book Siddhartha, very similar to that. The key thing in Shakyamuni's life was that he reached a certain point where he experienced for himself human suffering. He had been protected from it for most of his early life. And one day he got out of the confines of his palatial home of his parents and saw a suffering, saw a suffering due to old age. Suffering due to sickness, suffering due to death. And questioned it. Wanted to know why. Why is it that suffering exists? How does it exist?

The questions became very deep questions. Questions that really began to penetrate to the question of life and death itself. What is it? What is life? What is death? What is truth? What is reality? Who am I? Questions that are basically questions of virtually all religions in one way or another. Questions that have to do with the ultimate nature of reality. And so he did what most people at that time who had those kinds of questions did. He shaved his head. He left home. And he began to live the life of a monk.

He lived in the forests. He practiced the austerities of that time. He became one of the many ascetics that exist in India. Did without sleep. Did without food. He sat long hours in meditation. He did that for six years. He became one of the many skinny yogis that one sees in India to this day, practicing in the forest and in the hillsides. And at one point, he said to himself, this is not it. This is not going anywhere.

And he began to take food, stopped his fasting, rested his body, strengthened his body. The other monks that were with him left him. They thought he was taken over by some kind of demon. And he made himself strong again. And then he sat under the bodhi tree and did zazen. And it's in that sitting that he came to realize one morning what he was seeking. The very first words out of his mouth, upon realizing himself, upon experiencing what we call anyuttara samyak sambodhi, supreme enlightenment, was, isn't it incredible? Isn't it marvelous?

All sentient beings have the Buddha nature. All sentient beings are perfect and complete, lacking nothing. What he realized was that the Buddha nature, or the enlightened nature, was the nature of all beings. That, in fact, what we seek, we already have. In spite of the fact that we may not have discovered it, or experienced it for ourself, it is an intrinsic part of our being. And at first, he was very reluctant to teach.

In fact, he had a sense that, how do you teach something to someone that they already have? And then after a few days of looking at this, he decided to teach, and so began what's called upaya, the skillful means, that's found in all of the schools of Buddhism. The skillful means are a way of pointing to that which we already have. That's to be uncovered, experienced, realized.

In the first turning, so-called turning of the Dharma wheel, the beginnings, the very first teaching he ever gave, are the four wisdoms. And the first of those four wisdoms is the wisdom of suffering, he called it. all kinds of suffering, physical suffering, emotional suffering, psychological suffering. He said, life is suffering. The wisdom of life is suffering, was the first wisdom. And then he said that the second wisdom was the cause of suffering.

And of course, if you have something that exists, there also exists the possibility for its non-existence or cessation. And the fourth wisdom of the Buddha is the path. If there is suffering, there must be a cause. If a thing exists, it's possible for it not to exist. And the fourth is the way, the path to that non-existence. And the path is called the Eightfold Path of the Buddha.

At this monastery, that Eightfold Path of the Buddha resolves itself into what we call the Eight Dharma Gates of practice, the Eight Areas of Practice. This weekend, we'll be looking at those Eight Areas of Practice and looking at how it not only functions in a monastic matrix as a way of training, but how it can function in your own life. And the first and most important part of those Eight Areas is Zazen.

And you've already received beginning instruction, and I'm sure on the surface, Zazen appears to be meditation. But that's not what Zazen is, or I should say it's the smallest aspect of what Zazen is. Zazen is really not meditation, not contemplation, not introspection, not quieting the mind, not focusing the mind. It has nothing to do with mudras and mantras and mandalas.

Zazen is sitting Zen. Zah means sit. There's also walking Zen, which you just completed. There's working Zen, chanting Zen, bowing Zen, laughing Zen and crying Zen. Zen is a way of using your mind. It's a way of living your life. and it's a way of doing it with other people. And yet, at the same time, when you really get down to it, there's no rule book to go by.

And so, you have to go very deep into yourself to find the foundations of it. Ultimately, what we're talking about is a practice that's concerned with liberation. realizing the inherent freedom of each one of us. And that only can come from going deep into yourself and realizing that ground of being. So, Zazen becomes a process of peeling back the layers of conditioning, conditioning by our parents and teachers, by our culture, by our nation, by our education, conditioning that begins at birth and continues through our development so that by the time we reach adulthood, we don't know who we are, what our life's about or what we're doing.

It's a process that goes beneath those layers of conditioning to the ground of being itself. and enlightenment is to realize that ground of being and to actualize what we've experienced in our life rather than live our life like robots out of that program of conditioning. Not what we've heard or what we've been told but what we've realized for ourself.

Most of us are preoccupied. We talk to ourselves all the time. We're preoccupied with the past which has already happened and it doesn't exist. Or we're preoccupied with the future which hasn't happened yet. That too doesn't exist. And while we're immersed in that preoccupation, in that internal dialogue, we miss the moment to moment awareness of our lives.

We look but we don't see. We listen but we don't hear. We eat but we don't taste. We love but we don't feel. All of the data is there. The senses are receiving all of the information. but somehow cognition is not taking place because of that preoccupation. And what Zazen has to do with is coming back to that moment and experiencing it completely and fully with the whole body and mind.

The breath is the moment. Our life is the moment. And if we miss the moment we miss our life. And so with that preoccupation life slips by and we barely notice it in passing. Zazen has to do with returning to that moment.

A second area of practice that we'll deal with this weekend is what we call Zen study. A face-to-face teaching. It takes many forms. We'll explore all of those forms. Basically it has to do with the teacher-student relationship. Zen is part of an ancestral tradition. That is the teaching is transmitted mind to mind.

Not through words and letters. Not through the sutras. Not through the ritual. Not through the words and ideas that describe reality. But rather through the direct experience of that reality itself. And that's one of the uniquenesses of Zen. It's not enough to understand the teachings of the Buddha. It's not enough to believe the teachings of the Buddha. One must experience it for oneself.

And that experience is what we call realization. And that can only happen mind to mind. It began on Vulture Peak when the Buddha held up a flower to the assembly. The Mayakaya Shapa smiled. And Buddha said, I have the all-pervading Dharma, the exquisite teaching of formless form. I now transmit it to Mayakaya Shapa.

What is it that Mayakaya Shapa understood that the two-thousand other people in that assembly didn't? What's the significance of holding up the flower? Is there a meaning? What if everybody in the assembly had smiled? Would he have transmitted to all of them? What if no one had smiled? And what about the teachings of the Buddha himself where he said all sentient beings are already enlightened?

if they're already enlightened, what is it that Kaya Shapa saw? And it's these questions that the face-to-face teaching has to do with. A third area of training that we'll be exploring is what we call academic study. it's one thing to realize and very important to realize no question about it. But to realize and not understand is like having one's eyes open but in darkness.

To understand and not yet have realized is like having one's eyes closed in the bright light of day. But to both realize and understand is to have eyes open in the bright light of day. And so both of these things are important. The study of the sutras, understanding the philosophy, the history, the context out of which these teachings arose.

having the ability to communicate it to someone else who hasn't realized it is all what academic study is about. A fourth area of training is liturgy. We call it making visible, the invisible. You'll be participating in some of the daily liturgy of this monastery. That's a way we enter into different aspects of the day.

We call it making visible the invisible because what it does is it's a re- as all liturgy is, it's a restatement or a reaffirmation of the common experience of a sangha, of a community. And the common experience of the Buddhist community is that the self is an idea doesn't exist, never has existed.

And the liturgy is based on that. The liturgy as well as everything else that we'll be doing for this weekend is pointing to the same place. And it has one point and one point only, and that is the realization of the nature of the self, the realization of the nature of the self. Not understanding, not believing the Buddhist idea of the nature of the self, but realizing it for oneself.

The next area of training that we'll be looking at is that of the precepts, the moral and ethical teachings of the Buddha. Again, they come from the same place. And many Westerners have a difficult time appreciating how there can be a liturgy in a religion that's basically non-theistic and Buddhism is non-theistic.

It's not atheistic. It's not agnostic. It's non-theistic. It doesn't even take up the question of the existence or non-existence of God as being relevant to religion. To Buddhists that's a philosophical question. It has nothing to do with how you live your life. So if Buddha is not a god, why is he sitting on the altar? What does that mean? Why do we bow? Why do we chant?

We'll be looking at all of that. How can there be a moral and ethical teaching if there's no authority that's at the top of it all? Where there's no heaven and hell? Where indeed there is no good or evil? How do you have a moral and ethical teachings? What is the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism? Where does it come from? How does it manifest itself? How does it relate relate to my life and your life?

We'll be looking at that. We'll be looking at art practice, which is one of the eight areas of training. Out of Zen Buddhism has come a unique aesthetic that has no parallels, east or west, outside of Zen. An aesthetic that's unique to the practice that comes out of that same realization of the nature of the self.

The results of that kind of art was part of the whole creative development of the Song dynasty in China came right out of the monasteries. Zen monasteries of that time. Same thing happened during the Kamakura period in Japan, a great flowering in the arts, poetry and painting and sculpture and theater, tea ceremony and the martial arts.

All of it from the warrior arts of karate to the gentle arts arts of flower arranging there exists an aesthetic thread that connects them. It's a particular way of understanding the creative process and opening it up. We'll look at that. The same with body practice, another aspect of our training, which includes everything from the arts of kung fu to the art of washing the face, brushing teeth, that has to do with the unity of body and mind and understanding that unity and how it works.

And finally, the eighth area itself, work practice. It begins with what we call caretaking practice, physical labor that everyone in the monastery from the abbot down to the newest trainee does each day. It's a way of returning to the buildings and the grounds, the mountain, that which we receive from it by nourishing and caring for it.

It's a particular way of approaching work and ultimately it manifests itself in all aspects from picking weeds through operating a business, managing finances. it's a particular way of looking at it, of understanding it, of manifesting one's understanding in their everyday life.

There are three general aspects to our practice. One is called ascending the mountain, the struggle to realize oneself. Then sooner or later we come to that place where we realize the nature of the self. it's within the potential of all humans to realize oneself. But it takes great doubt to do it.

Constant questioning of everything. Who am I? What is life? What is truth? What is God? What is reality? That great doubt is an extremely important aspect of Zen training. Without it, it goes nowhere. It's wishy-washy.

Second thing that's important is great faith. Faith in oneself and one's ability to realize oneself. And that great doubt and great faith are in dynamic tension with each other. and the third is great effort. The effort to realize oneself, to actualize what we've realized.

And these eight areas of training proceed through various stages of development. Obviously, the zazen of somebody that's just beginning is very different than the zazen of somebody who's been practicing for ten years, fifteen years. And so the zazen develops through stages.

The teacher-student relationship develops through stages. The way we understand art practice or body practice develops through stages. And we'll be looking at those stages of development. They correspond to the ten ox-herding pictures that you'll see on the wall in the dining hall from the rank beginner entering or searching for the way actually to finally coming down off the mountain back into the marketplace, the tenth ox-herding picture.

In each of those ten stages of development, development occurs in these eight areas. And these eight areas are nothing but our life itself. Our life is work and creative process, moral and ethical teachings. It all comes out of zazen. That's the heartbeat. That's the core. That's the ground of it all.

And what we'll be doing this weekend is looking at how that process takes place. To realize the nature of the self is what we call wisdom. To realize you and I are the same thing. Same thing. and yet I'm not you and you're not me. Both of those things exist simultaneously.

That's the wisdom that's to be realized. Not understood, not believed, but realized. When you realize that, you realize that cause and effect are one. That what you do and what happens to you are the same thing. Life doesn't happen to us, we create it.

And when you really understand that, you understand responsibility. You understand being responsible for the whole universe, not just yourself. and when that comes home, really comes home, you can no longer blame. You can no longer say, he made me angry because you know from your own experience that only you can make you angry.

And when you realize that only you can make you angry, you empower yourself to do something about your anger. so long as he made you angry, there's nothing you can do about it. You're just a victim. But when you realize that you are the master of your life, it's then that you can transform your life.

That's what this practice is about. it's no small thing to be born human. This gift of life is precious and an absolute shame to waste it. To waste it struggling, to waste it suffering. so hopefully this weekend will be an opportunity to see if and how what the Buddha way has to teach has any relevance to your life.

It'll give you an opportunity to see how it might fit or how it might not fit. But nothing is going to work unless you start out prepared to engage it, to receive it, to hear it, to experience it. And to do that you need to empty your cup and be prepared to receive it.

So please take advantage. Really put yourself into it. see how it works by doing it. We call it Zen training by no accident or Zen practice. To practice means to do. To train means to do. This is not a weekend in religious education. It's got to do with doing. thing. So please take advantage and do it.
