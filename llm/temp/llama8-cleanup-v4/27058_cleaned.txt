all of the things that were causing problems in your life before are still with you. And in the process of working through them here, you begin to see them, and little by little over a course of years of training, you're able to turn it around, ultimately.

So it's not so unusual that the monks of the East Hall and the West Hall were arguing. And it's not so unusual that Nansen would have taken some drastic measures like that. Things were very different in the way you trained monks in China than the way you train monks today.

Can you imagine you guys arguing about Chloe, and I cut her in half? The ASPCA would be here, the sheriff would be here, I'd be sued, and probably strung up by the very monks that I'm trying to send a message to. So it doesn't work. But the principle is the same.

What Nansen was revealing and what Joshu was revealing is revealed again and again. And that has to do with how do you resolve conflicts? How do you resolve the dualities? What do you do when you come right up against a brick wall? How do you get by it? Do you ignore it? Do you run away from it? Do you deny it? Do you become it? Do you knock it down? Do you climb over it? What are the possibilities?

Engel tells us that where the road of ideation cannot reach, that's just right to bring to your attention. So what he's basically saying is that what he's bringing to our attention here is something that can't be reached by words and ideas. Where verbal explanation cannot reach, you must set your eyes on it quickly because it's instant. It's an action. And it's not something you can talk about and reflect on later.

The minute it's gone, it's gone. And the words and ideas that remain that describe it's not it. So you're left holding on to the description, but the reality has been missed. And the description just doesn't cut it. You know, it's one thing to say something and it's quite another to do it.

I was very interested in the survival workshop. I was in and out of both the workshops this weekend, interested in hearing what was going on. And I heard several interesting things, saw several interesting things. One is in the survival thing, number one or two at the top of this list of things that you need to do in order to survive was vanquish all panic. And then he goes on to say, you know, then size up the situation, then do this, then do that, and do that. Vanquish all panic was number one. How? How? How do you do that?

When you're scared out of your wits, when you're like that guy in the Jack London story who fell through the ice, he's soaking wet, he knows he's going to be dead in three minutes, he's trying to light a fire. How do you vanquish fear? It doesn't matter all the other things that follow that. You can have all the skills up to gazoo and all the equipment up to gazoo. But if you're scared out of your wits, you can't use it.

You can be the finest karate practitioner on the face of the earth. But if you're afraid of death, if you haven't resolved the question of life and death, it's useless, absolutely useless. So how do you take care of that number one thing? Vanquish all fear. Or anger. Same can be said for anger. An angry karate student is useless. But you lose all of your skills with anger. And greed is the same thing. Those poisons poison everything.

How do you deal with that? How do you turn it around? And so he brings up this old case of nonsense. And let me give you the footnotes. Engel also adds little footnotes to help you understand this line by line. The first line, it says, That nonsense place one day the monks of the Eastern and Western halls were arguing about a cat.

And the footnote says, It's not just today. It's not just today that they're haggling together. This is a case of degeneracy. Eastern and Western halls are the administrative wing of the monastery and the practice wing, the training wing of the monastery. Evidently, there was a monastery cat. And the administrators wanted the cat in the office to take care of the mice there. And the training people wanted the cat in the training hall.

So I guess they were arguing over it. And it's mine or it's mine. Or it's good or it's bad. Or it's heaven or it's hurt. Earth, it's male or it's female. It's absolute or it's relative. All of those dualities. How do you resolve them? So Nansen took the subject of this discussion, the cat, and held it up and said, If you can say a word of Zen, I won't kill it.

The footnote says, When the true imperative goes into effect, the ten directions are subdued. This old fellow has the capability to distinguish dragons from snakes. The ten directions are subdued means things return to the absolute basis of reality. He has the capability of distinguishing dragons from snakes. Dragons are enlightened beings. Snakes are deluded beings. And he's seeing them. He's seeing who's enlightened, who's deluded.

No one in the community replied. The footnote says, What a pity to let him go. What a pity to let Nansen go. A bunch of lacquered tubs. What are they worth? Phony Zen followers are as plentiful as hemp and millet. It's easy to talk about it. It's easy to use the words and ideas that describe reality. It's quite another thing to have manifested that reality with your own life.

There are plenty of books about Zen to read. And people read them. We gobble them up. We're an intellectual society. And we're really convinced that if you can read it and say it, you know it. You understand it. And it's easy to get away with it with something like Zen. Because the only one you're fooling is yourself. And when all hell breaks loose, you realize that you don't have what it takes to be able to be in peace and harmony in when all hell breaks loose.

It's a little bit less easy to fool yourself if your practice is something like karate. You know, you can read a book on karate and convince yourself that you're really good. But when you come up against somebody else who has been practicing, you find out. Try it sometimes with tennis or softball or something else. Try reading a book and mastering it. You have to do it. To practice is to do. To train is to do. All the rest of it is the words and ideas that describe the doing.

No matter how wonderful, eloquent, charismatic those words may be, if they're not part of the substance of your life, the very pores of your skin and blood and bones, then it's not yours. It belongs to somebody else and you're the parrot. So how do you make it your own? Nansen cut the cat in two pieces. Footnote says, How quick! How quick! If he hadn't acted like this, there would all be fellows playing with a mud ball.

He draws the bow after the thief is gone. Already this is secondary. So if words do not convey the truth, and if letters do not embody the spirit, if to attach to words is to be lost, if to abide in letters is to remain in ignorance, then how will you find your way? How will you penetrate the barrier? How will you cast away body and mind? How will you be the kohan, or be the barrier? Turn it around.

You'd be surprised how easy it is to turn it around. You'd be surprised how free you are to turn it around. Try it. You have the power to do it. You have the power to make north-south and south-north. Imitating Joshu won't do it. Saying it won't do it. Won't help you any more than it helped me. Doesn't impart strength. Believing doesn't impart strength. Understanding doesn't impart strength. But realizing it, and to realize means to do it, does.

And I'm sure all my talking has led you even further astray. So, please, forgive me. Do it. Make it your own. Thank you. Thank you.
