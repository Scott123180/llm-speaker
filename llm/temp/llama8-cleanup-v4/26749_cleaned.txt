The Book of Equanimity, Case 82, Yunmen's Sound and Form, Preface to the Assembly.

Not cutting off sound and form is falling wherever you are. Searching by way of sound and looking by way of form, you don't see the Buddha. Isn't there anyone who can take the road and return home? The main case.

Yunmen said to the Assembly, Hearing sound, awaken to the way. Seeing form, understand the mind.

The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara brings money to buy a sesame cake. When she lowers her hand, it turns out to be a jelly donut.

The Verse.

Going out the gate, making the horse leap, sweeping away the comets. The smoke and dust of 10,000 countries is spontaneously clear. The twelve media are free of useless images and echoes. Pure light emanates in a billion worlds.

It's now at our last full day of the session. And we're doing the discourse this morning instead of this afternoon because of my having to repay an obligation of Zen Mountain Monastery to the Seto Karate Organization. They're celebrating their 14th anniversary today. And last year, right about this time, we had a mountain seat ceremony and they canceled their anniversary celebration in order for the students to be here. So we kind of owe them one. And I couldn't come up with really any excuses not to go there and make a small speech for them this afternoon. So we switched to morning discourse. Actually, morning is when it usually is. That's traditional, the traditional time to do it. We do it in the afternoon because it kind of breaks up the afternoon a little bit.

Tomorrow, we're going to be doing Dharma combat. So as a way of training the Sangha for the Dharma combat that comes at the end of next session the Shuso Hosin where the Shuso does the Dharma combat with the Sangha. So tomorrow you'll get an opportunity to hone your abilities with me and this evening and this afternoon will be a good opportunity to sit deeply so that your minds are nice and clear tomorrow for Dharma combat.

This koan kind of relates to the one that we did yesterday. That koan yesterday was kind of straightforward and yet a lot of people had questions about it so I figured I'd go a little bit further with it with this koan. It's really addressing the same point. In a sense you can say all 1700 koans and all of the sutras and all of the sayings all address the same point. They're all making the same point.

I remember I used to every once in a while I'd say to my teacher after he gave a taste show and I'd say boy that was a great taste show Roshi and he'd look at me kind of quizzically and say it's the same thing I've always been saying. I say the same thing each time. Somehow one time you get it another time you don't get it so what we do is just keep repeating the same old stuff 500,000 different ways until people see it for themselves realize it for themselves.

Someone during Dokusan referred to a koan I had done some time ago in which I think the poem used the phrase God God mask devil mask in referring to Master Zwegen who every morning used to wake up and say to himself Master and then he would answer himself Yes Master and then he would say never be deceived by anyone any time any place and then he would answer Yes Master so in the verse to that koan Master Mumman used this phrase God's mask devil mask and in a sense that phrase refers to the Bodhisattva of compassion Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva who manifests her compassion according to circumstances but when she's manifesting her compassion she's always appearing in a form appropriate for the circumstances so she doesn't go as a winged angel with a halo around her head when she needs to teach the hell's angels she comes as a hell's angel in the form of a hell's angel and is able to teach with no sense of separation in addressing a god she appears as a god in addressing a devil she appears as a devil always in a form appropriate to the circumstances in the introduction to this koan it says not cutting off sound and form is falling wherever you are searching by way of sound and looking by way of form you don't see the Buddha and yet in the main case it says hearing sound awaken to the way seeing form understand the mind again are these contradictions they're saying something different or they're saying the same thing well it's pretty standard teaching in Buddhism that chasing sounds and following forms must be avoided at all costs being controlled and manipulated by sounds and forms and umban in another koan actually a koan that we use for people who are going to become monks they need to pass through this koan it's called bell sound and the priest's robe and uman addressing the assembly said this world is vast and boundless why when the bell rings do you put on your priestly robes what he's saying is that there's absolutely complete unequivocal freedom that reaches everywhere that's the life of us that's what our training is about yet the bell rings and you put on your robes the clappers go and you start kin hin how is that freedom why do you do it basically what uman is saying in this koan is hear the sound and awaken see the form and realize the mind that's very different than chasing after the difference between chasing after and hearing and seeing is intimacy no separation hearing sound awaken to the way seeing form understand the mind then he goes on to say the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara brings money to buy a sesame cake when she lowers her hand it turns out to be a jelly donut why not I mean you know Jesus multiplied the loaves and Moses opened the red sea why can't Avalokiteshvara turn a sesame bun into a jelly donut there's a teaching there's a magic there's something going on and that's what we need to see in order to appreciate this coin in another case a monk asks Master Kempo the Bhagavats of the ten directions have one way to nirvana I wonder what it is and Kempo took his stick and drew a line and said it's right here monk didn't understand he went to Uman and he told Uman what happened he said I don't understand please teach me Uman held up his fan and said this fan jumps to the fifth heaven and hits the deity on the nose there again is that magic or is he saying something that needs to be seen in the commentary to this coin the statement says Tian Tong brings up the story talking about the swift steed omitting its color talking about the swift steed and omitting its color is essentially directing yourself to the essence and not worrying about the details and that's what the koan is taken the essence of something that appeared in the original record of Uman and in the original record of Uman said to the assembly hearing sound realize the way seeing form understand the mind how is this then he raised his hand and said Avilokiteshvara Bodhisattva brings money to buy a sesame cake when she lowers her hand actually it turns out to be a jelly donut so basically how is this explains hearing sound realizing the way seeing form understand the mind still don't see it right right okay another teacher the national teacher commenting on this said we might say of Yunmen that his tune as his tune became more lofty those who harmonized became rarer and it's kind of true of Uman Uman's zen is very very obtruse very difficult to appreciate you need to appreciate his style before you can appreciate the way he uses words his teaching was called lip and mouth zen very similar to Joshu only not so cutting as Joshu much more subtle than Joshu he never used the devices of such teachers as Rinzai with the shout or the punch he always did it with turning words and it said that his words always contained three phrases one of those phrases is the phrase and it could be a single word someone once asked them what is Buddha and his answer was a sesame cake or buns sesame buns that single statement sesame buns contains the three phrases of uman and the first phrase cuts off the myriad streams called cutting off the myriad streams the second is following after the waves and the third is it encompasses heaven and earth and one of his disciples made a poem on each one of those three phrases to help you understand it even a little bit more the first on containing the whole world containing the whole universe that is oneness he says fundamental reality fundamental emptiness one form one flavor it's not that a subtle entity doesn't exist it's not a matter for hesitating over clear and lucid this contains the whole world that's one phrase cutting off the myriad streams he says it is fundamentally not a matter of interpretation or understanding when you sum it all up it's not worth a single letter when the myriad activities abruptly cease that's cutting off the myriad streams in other words stopping all thought seeing directly pure cognition without extra then the third following the waves when you allow the presence of another follow the sprouts to describe the ground understand the person by means of their words this is going along with the ripples following the waves in other words adapting the teaching in accord with the circumstance so one adapts the teaching in accord with the circumstance another abruptly cuts off all thought and the third encompasses heaven and earth those three phrases are contained in the single phrase sesame seed bun or in this teaching in this column and he used he had a way of teaching to use what he called substitute sayings in which he answers a question that he poses himself and that's the case in this in this column or he supplies an answer to a question of an earlier master substituting the saying for some speechless monk in the khan or he gives an alternative saying another way of seeing the same thing such in the case that I already mentioned when the monk asked about the one way of the Bhagavats in Kempo drew a line and Uman held up his fan and said this fan jumps to the thirty second heaven and hits the deity there on the nose that's an alternative interpretation of what another master said so these devices of Uman were his style of teaching and they're functioning in this koan and the national teacher says right now of Uman he enters the universal net meditation atop my whisk atop my whisk is the fly whisk he's saying that Uman has entered the universal net meditation the universal net is that diamond net of Indra which every facet of the net reflects and contains every other facet in the net throughout time and space that is Uman is completely unified with all phenomena absolute and relative past present future no separation that's what he's he right now enters the universal net meditation that statement he enters concentration in the east and emerges from it in the west he enters concentration in a male body and emerges in a female body but do you understand what is east what is west what is maleness femaleness then he goes on to say the colors of the meadow are not blocked anymore by mountains the moonlight and water directly penetrate each other I say seeking without finding in the ocean instead they meet on the shore this is all the statement of the national teacher with regard to Uman the moonlight and the water directly penetrate each other like two arrows meeting in midair there's all this magic appears on the top of his whisk enters meditation with a male body merges with a female body that's mutual interpenetration.

Bodhidharma was talking about this when Emperor Wu said to him well who are you standing here before me and he said I don't know the old man wasn't stupid he was clear.

The spiritual light shines alone far transcending the senses. You know it's kind of interesting with light you can't see light until it bounces off something there's no knowing light I mean out in outer space there's light all over the place you don't see it it's just black but the minute an object appears dust for example that surrounds the earth and the earth glows or reflects the moon reflects the spaceship reflects but with light itself it needs to bounce off something reflect off something be dispersed by something and what you see is the thing that it's bouncing off not the light itself.

Spiritual light shines alone spiritual light shines all one as one thing throughout the whole universe is beyond the senses beyond perception we proceed through practice with the assumption that what we attain needs to become part of our understanding no matter how many times we talk about koans and say that there's a whole other thing that's happening it's a direct experience we inevitably twist and turn and force in order to take what was realized and make it what was understood and the minute you do that you've lost it you understand it but you don't realize it you want to understand it go to any college take a course in buddhism you'll get all you'll get all the understanding you need what our practice is is realization making it your own hearing sound awaken to the way seeing form understand the mind dogan says seeing form with a whole body and mind one understands them intimately hearing sound with a whole body and mind one understands it intimately understanding it intimately is very very different than understanding in understanding it intimately there is no knowing there is no knower there is no thing known so understand the breath intimately understand the koan intimately understand your life intimately understand these mountains and rivers and the great earth itself intimately don't separate yourself that's the key to the functioning of our avalokiteshvara bodhisattva there's no intimacy going out into the world I'm going to save you I'm going to save you with separation if you want to save all sentient beings be all sentient beings and be prepared to be saved by all sentient beings that's mutual interpenetration.

Acknowledging mutual identity acknowledging codependency no master asks if suddenly each sense faculty and each sense field extended throughout the whole universe what would that be like if the eye extended throughout the universe if the mind extended throughout the universe if thought extended throughout the universe if taste extended throughout the universe how is that? Then he answers I thought it was a jelly donut and after all it's a sesame cake. Do you understand? Well, if you do you've missed it. It's got nothing to do with understanding. So throw that away and keep going. See it from the point of view of umman. See it from the point of view of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva. Forget the self. See it from the point of view of the breath of the mountains and rivers themselves of Mu of the whole phenomenal universe. Step out of the skin bag just for a moment and realize the whole catastrophe as nothing but yourself. then you're speaking the same language as umman as the buddhas as the ancestors.
