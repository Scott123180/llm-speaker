Master Dogen's 300 Koan Shobo Genzo Case 17, Zedeng's Great Enlightenment

The main case: The great master Zedeng of Zigan Monastery was bright in nature. Being at the assembly of Guishan, he was well learned and had extensive memory. Guishan one day said to Ziyan, everything you say is what you've memorized from commentaries. Now I'm going to ask you a question. When you were an infant, before you could even distinguish east from west, at this time, how was it? Zigan spoke and presented his understanding, explaining the principle, but he could not get approval. He went through the texts he had collected and studied, but he could not find an answer that would satisfy the master. Deeply grieved and in tears, he burned all his books and commentaries. And then he said to himself, I will never understand Zen in this lifetime. I will become a hermit monk and enter the mountain in practice.

Thus, he entered Mount Wundang and built a hut near the grave site of the national teacher. One day, while he was sweeping the path, a pebble struck a bamboo and made a cracking sound. At that moment, he suddenly had a great enlightenment experience. He wrote a poem expressing his understanding. One crack and all knowledge has dissolved. The struggle is over. I follow the ancient way, not lapsing into quietude. Dignified in bearing and conduct beyond sound and form, no trace remains. Those who have mastered the way call this unsurpassable activity.

He presented this poem to Guishan, who said, this fellow has penetrated it completely. The Commentary: The Buddhas and ancestors have not transmitted a single phrase. Guishan's Dharma was transmitted face to face, mind to mind. It was not about pebbles, bamboo, seeing, hearing, or knowing. Because the way reaches everywhere, no communication whatsoever is possible. If you can penetrate through the forest of brambles and cut free all clinging, you enter the peaceful dwelling right where you are.

Capping verse: Hearing sounds with the whole body and mind, seeing forms with the whole body and mind, one understands them intimately.

The session is kind of surprising, unpredictable, like most sessions are. Normally during Ongo sessions, we kind of expect things to be very strong, very solid. And there were one or two of the last couple of Ongos, one or two of the sessions that weren't strong and solid. And we expect usually the summer sessions because of a little lighter schedule or a little lighter. And this session is more like an Ongo session than some of the sessions we've already done.

Sitting has been strong. The practice has been very sincere. People have been really pushing their edges. It's kind of surprising given that you know, it's not a very pushy session and not a lot of demands are being made. That energy has come right out of this group, whatever the karma of this group happens to be, all of you coming together.

One of the things I had heard in Doksan is that the talks by the three people that preceded me were kind of pushy talks in a way, kind of demanding that people look at their practice and how they're practicing. I was telling Shugan this morning that people coming into Doksan all worked up, ready to impale themselves on the sword of Manjushri and said, what the hell have you been saying out there to them? And I had this, well in that period of time there weren't many choices for people from distinguished families what to do with their lives. They could be a general, a merchant, or follow a religious life and many of them chose a religious life rather than the other two.

And as a result, some very highly intelligent, highly trained, educated people ended up in the monasteries of Tang Dynasty China and they were very well informed. They knew a lot. It reminds me a lot of the situation today. Most Zen practitioners are very highly educated. It's not because they come from wealthy families, it's because education is so much more accessible now than it ever was in the history of the world.

So I find that contrary to the way it was when I started practice, there were no books on Buddhism. When I first got interested in Buddhism, I was actually teaching in a Unitarian Sunday school. And I remember I wanted to teach something about Buddhism as part of the world religion class. And when I went to the library, I could find almost nothing on Buddhism in, I don't know, I guess it was 1955, 56. I found stuff in the Encyclopedia Britannica finally and used that as the basis of a course that I was doing for high school students.

So there was very little. And when we did Cohen's study, what we got was the main case on a mimeograph sheet of paper without the advantage of all the commentaries and different translations and so on that are available now that, well, I don't know if it makes it easier, maybe it makes it worse for the modern student. In any case, there was very little available in terms of literature.

These days, most practitioners that come into practice are very well-read. They know a lot. Many of them, in fact, have taken courses in Buddhism at the university that didn't exist in the 1950s. And so they're very, very well informed, much like what was going on in Tang Dynasty. And Kyogen was one of these people. He was very scholarly in nature. And he had a very good memory. And he had been practicing with Isan for a long time, along with his Dharma brother, Kyogen, and his Dharma sister, Ayn Gleinstone Lu.

And Gwishan said to him one day, he said, everything you say is what you've memorized from commentaries. I'm going to ask you a question. And I'd like you to answer it from your own experience, not from what you read. When you were an infant, before you could even distinguish east from west at this time, how was it? What is the truth? What is your understanding? Forget about the commentaries. And Gwishan couldn't answer. I mean, he made all kinds of presentations, but none of them reached it.

Kind of reminds me a little bit of Ananda. Ananda was the same way. Ananda had an incredible memory. In fact, it's said that most of the sutras are Ananda reciting from memory after Buddha's death all of the teachings he gave. And these were written down then and became the thus I have heard that you see in the sutras. That's what Ananda heard. So he could verbatim recite everything that the Buddha ever said. And yet the interesting thing is is that the first successor of the Buddha wasn't Ananda. It was my Kaisapa. Ananda came after that.

Now Ananda, the reason he memorized, was able to remember all of the talks given by the Buddha is he never missed one of them. He was always there. He was the Buddha's attendant. So he heard every talk the Buddha ever gave. And not only did he hear it, he remembered it. But on Mount Gudakutra, when the Buddha came out to address the assembly of thousands, and without a word he held up a flower, it was Makai Kaisapa that smiled and blinked his eyes, not Ananda. And the Buddha said, I have the all-pervading Dharma, the exquisite teaching of formless form. It cannot be conveyed through words and letters. I now pass it to you.

And so Kyozan, after his experience, wrote a poem expressing his understanding. He said, one crack and all knowledge has dissolved. The struggle is over. I follow the ancient way, not lapsing into quietude. Dignified in bearing and conduct beyond sound and form, no trace remains. Those who have mastered the way call this unsurpassable activity.

Actually, this poem is one of the koans, the hundred miscellaneous koans that we deal with. He presented to Kyozan, who said, this fellow has penetrated it completely. Now, it's kind of interesting, there's another koan that I think I've already done that has to do with Kyozan, the other successor of Isan, who didn't accept the fact that Kyozan was enlightened. I don't know, maybe it was sibling competition or whatever, but he said to Isan, I don't think he's realized. And he was a senior disciple, and teachers have a tendency to listen to their senior disciples.

So he wanted to further test Kyozan's understanding. So Kyozan composed a second poem, and in the second poem he said, my poverty last year was not true poverty. This year's poverty is the real thing. Last year a fine-pointed gimlet could find a place. This year even the gimlet is gone. And nothing remained. Yangshan still wasn't fully satisfied, so Kyozan wrote a third poem. And he said, I have a single potential. It can be seen in the twinkling of an eye. If you still don't understand, call the attendant and ask him.

And finally, both Yangshan and Isan approved him. In the commentary it says, the Buddhas and ancestors have not transmitted a single phrase. Guishan's Dharma was transmitted face to face, mind to mind. It was not about pebbles, bamboo, seeing, hearing, or knowing. So how was it transmitted mind to mind when the disciple was a hundred miles away from where the teacher was when the realization occurred?

When that question comes up, it's really a question about the confusion of what the mind to mind transmission is about. I hear it from scholars all the time who laugh and say, you know, there was a big gap from this generation to this generation. How can you talk about an unbroken lineage, mind to mind? And my answer to them is that if the Buddha Dharma disappeared from the face of the earth for a hundred years, and there wasn't a sutra to be found or an enlightened master to be found anywhere for a hundred years, if one day someone realized themselves, immediately there would be a direct mind to mind transmission from the Buddha to that person.

It has nothing to do with space and time. Each transmission, each realization is mind to mind, not from the teacher to the disciple, but from the Buddha to the disciple, over a span of 2,500 years. It's immediate and it's direct. That's what Buddha mind means. And so Grishan's Dharma was transmitted face to face, mind to mind. It had nothing to do with pebbles, bamboo, seeing, hearing, or knowing.

Well, he heard the crack of the bamboo. Didn't hearing have something to do with it? Absolutely not. Not that kind of hearing. That's hearing with the ears. What we're talking about is hearing with the whole body and mind. It's a very different kind of hearing. And then the next line in the commentary says, because the way reaches everywhere, no communication whatsoever is possible.

What does that mean? We just got through talking about transmission. Isn't transmission communication? No. Nothing goes from A to B. Nothing is given and nothing is received. Why? Because it's already there. Each one of us is born with it and dies with it, whether we realize it or not. So no communication whatsoever is possible.

That statement is made because you can only communicate between things that are separate. If it's all one thing, no communication whatsoever is possible. All you can do is nod to yourself. If you can penetrate through the forest of brambles and cut free, all clinging, you enter the peaceful dwelling right where you are.

The forest of brambles are the barriers, the difficulties that we encounter in life. The clinging are the things that we hold on to. And what these instructions are saying is just drop away those things and what remains is the peaceful dwelling, is the Buddha nature. The Buddha nature is just buried under all of that.

So what our practice is about is getting rid of all the extra and getting down to that ground of being that's underneath it all, underneath all of the conditioning. I've added footnotes to this to help clarify it.

The great master, Kyogen, was bright by nature. Being at the assembly of Yisan, he was well learned and had extensive memory. Footnote says, brambles, a thousand feet high and a hundred miles deep. Those were the brambles of Kyogen. Yisan one day said to him, everything you say is what you've memorized from commentaries. Now I'm going to ask you a question. When you were an infant, before you could even distinguish east from west at this time, how was it? The footnote says the old man wants to kill this monk, but then that's the imperative of our school.

Of course, the killing he's talking about here is the killing, the death of the ego, the death of a notion of a self that separates him from the truth. Kyogen spoke and presented his understanding, explaining the principle, but he could not get approval. The footnotes says explanations never do. He went through the texts he had collected and studied, but he could not find an answer that would satisfy the master. Footnote to that said, even if he had found it, still it would not reach it.

Those would still be the words and ideas that describe the reality and not the reality itself. That's what Isan was looking for. Deeply grieved and in tears, and the footnote says, it's Guishan who should be weeping. Sometimes I feel like weeping when I sit there with a student for 20 minutes and give everything I possibly can, and they don't get it. It's not the student that's failed, it's the teacher that's failed. It's my fault, not their fault.

In this case, it's Isan's fault, and he should be weeping instead of his disciple. Then he burned all his books and commentaries, and the footnote says, it's like beating up your car because it won't start. And there's nothing to do with the books and the commentaries, there's nothing wrong with the words, there's nothing wrong with the sutras, it's just that those are the words that describe the reality.

What's the reality? What's the experience of the reality? That's the requirement of the Zen school. And then he said to himself, I will never understand Zen in this lifetime. I will become a hermit monk and enter a mountain and practice. Footnote says, good move, time to shut up and sit.

Thus he entered the mountain and built a hut near the gravesite of the national teacher. Footnote to that says, the spirit of the national teacher remains. One day while he was sweeping the path, a pebble struck bamboo and made a cracking sound. The footnote says it's not the pebble nor the bamboo that makes the sound. What is it? You tell me. See that and you've seen what it was that he realized.

At that moment he suddenly had a great enlightenment experience. The footnote to that says, tell me, what did he see? He wrote a poem expressing his understanding. One crack and all knowledge is dissolved. The struggle is over. I follow the ancient way not lapsing into quietude. Dignified and bearing in conduct beyond sound and form no trace remains. Those who have mastered the way call this unsurpassable activity.

The footnote says, still he's as talkative as ever, yet there seems to be something to it. He presented the poem to Guishan who said, this fellow has penetrated it completely. The footnote to that says, only a doting parent could muck it up like this.

And finally, the capping verse. Hearing sounds with the whole body and mind, seeing forms with the whole body and mind, one understands them intimately. Intimacy, and I was reading something recently by another teacher who was talking about intimacy. And he was saying that intimacy is about being close, being very close.

Well, intimacy is not about being close, not the intimacy that Dogen is talking about. It's not about being close, it's not about being very close, it's not about being very, very close, it's about no gaps, no gaps whatsoever. It's about seamlessness. So hearing sounds with the whole body and mind, seeing forms with the whole body and mind, one understands them intimately. No separation.

That's the way to practice every aspect of our practice. That's the way to practice the breath. That's the way to practice move. That's the way to practice the cons. That's the way to practice our barriers, our difficulties, our pain, whole body and mind. No separation.

Dogen commenting on this koan said, bamboos make sound when hit by stones, but all who hear them do not grasp enlightenment. I'm quoting Dogen now. By virtue of long and painful training in the way we may grasp the Buddhist truth. Not because the sound of bamboo hit by a stone is sharp, nor because the color of bamboos is extremely fine.

The delicate sound of a bamboo is not so much made by the bamboo itself as by the stone that happens to hit it. We are all endowed with the way, but we depend on the collective strength of all practitioners who are practicing the way for its grasp. Clever as we are, we are dependent on them for our training in the way.

We must therefore study and seek the way wholeheartedly and earnestly. Just as a jewel becomes valuable by polishing, so do we become excellent by training. Is there any jewel which emits a bright light from the start? Is there any person endowed with excellent ability from the first? We should train ourselves just as we polish a jewel.

We must not belittle ourselves, nor be idle in training. This is an admission by the great master Dogen. We need to trust ourselves. Not puff ourselves up, but not put ourselves down either. Just simply trust. Appreciate the fact that just as we are, we are Buddhas, perfect and complete.

There isn't a single one of us that fails, that comes short of our own completeness. And to appreciate that fact is to appreciate the heart of what this Buddhadharma is. It's not an outside matter. There is no outside. That's the great matter of life and death of the Buddhadharma.

See that clearly and you enter the way that all the Buddhas, past, present, and future have entered. See that clearly and you verify and actualize the realization of the Buddha himself in your life. So please take care of it.
