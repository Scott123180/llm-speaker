Summit of the Mystic Peak, Bluecliffe Record, Cases 23, 25, and 26. Case 23, Master Ingo's Pointer.

Jade is tested by fire, gold by a stone, sword by a hair, water by a staff. In Zen training, the degree of one's attainment and one's progress is known by one's words and phrases, one's attitude and actions, one's coming and going, one's asking and responding.

Tell me, how will it be done? Listen to the following. When Hofoku and Choke went out for a walk, Hofoku pointed with his finger and said, "This is the marvelous, sacred, mystic peak." Choke said, "What you say is well said, but what a pity."

Choke puts in his comments saying, "Today, walking with this man, what is he plotting?" And again he says, "I don't say we do not find such people as this once in a hundred or a thousand years, but they are rare."

A monk related this to Kyose, who said, "But for Choke's remark, the field would have been littered with skulls." Master Setyo's verse. This is the summit of the mystic peak. Now weeds grow rampant. You see it clearly, but to whom could you impart it? If you, O Choke, didn't discriminate, many would never know, and their skulls would litter the field.

And this week and intensive had to do with part of our ongoing theme, and that is the looking at mysticism and three great religious traditions of Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism. And this weekend we did the first of that series, a look at Christian mysticism with Professor Bochin and through a lot of the teachings of Merton.

And again and again, the question comes up, of course, what is what is the mystical experience? What is what is indeed mysticism itself? Now in this sutra, in this koan, there's a reference to the marvelous mystic peak. Now that marvelous mystic peak is kind of, it's a reference, first of all, to a mythological sacred mountain that's referred to in the Avakatamsa Sutra.

And through these centuries it became kind of symbolic of ultimate reality itself. So it's another way of saying ultimate reality. In a sense, what Hōfoku was doing was pointing to right where he was and saying this is ultimate reality. And Chokye, who was with him, who was a much more senior, much more mature monk, said, though it's true what you say, what a pity.

So Chokye was making a comment on that statement of ultimate reality. And Satcho's commentary and Kiyose's comment were all approving what Chokye said. And many times you've heard us talk about the fact that one aspect of Zen training is ascending the mountain.

And then sooner or later with great faith, great doubt and great perseverance one reaches the peak, the great mystic peak, the ground of being, ultimate reality, the thing that the mystics talk about constantly. But that the journey doesn't end on the peak, it continues. And it continues down the other side back into the world.

Many times I've referred to the work of Evelyn Underhill, her book Mysticism is a classic in the field. She's written many books, actually. And is quite an extraordinary woman. I've tried to get more detailed information on her life and whether or not there was any mystical training other than what she learned from reading or at the university.

But her book Practical Mysticism I mean, her book Mysticism was written, I think it was published in 1901 and 1902, which was kind of extraordinary for that period of time. And to this day it remains a definitive work on mysticism. There have been hundreds of books since, but none of them come anywhere near the understanding of the whole process that is exhibited in the works of this woman.

And she lived during the period, she was born in 1875 and died in 1941, so quite young. She was 66 years old when she died. She's an English poet and a novelist and also a writer on mysticism. And she was born in England and educated at King's College for Women in London.

And she became a lecturer on philosophy of religion at Oxford in 1921. And it was between 19 and 1920 that she wrote lots of novels and lots of poetry. But then the reason she survives to this day is not because of her novels or her poetry, but rather because of her great works on mysticism.

And she wrote The Mystic Way, Practical Mysticism, Essentials of Mysticism, Life of the Spirit and Life of Today, Concerning the Inner Light, Man and the Supernatural, The House of the Soul. There's a whole series of books that she wrote during a very short period of time, 10, 15 years.

And all of them exhibit a profound understanding, not just the work of a scholar, but a profound understanding of her subject. In this particular book, Practical Mysticism, you know, the question comes up, well, you know, mysticism is okay for monks and monasteries, but what about nine to five? What about dirty diapers? What about the homeless and the hungry?

The environment taking care of the roof over our heads and the food on the plate? And again and again the statement comes up that those who regard the mundane as a hindrance to practice only understand that in the mundane nothing is sacred. But what they haven't yet understood is that in sacredness, true sacredness, nothing, nothing is mundane.

In her preface to her book on Practical Mysticism, she says, and let me quote, "This little book was written during the last months of peace and goes to press in the first weeks of the Great War, because this was World War I. Many will feel that in such a time of conflict and horror when only the most ignorant, disloyal, or apathetic can hope for quietness of mine, a book which deals with that which is called contemplative attitude to existence is wholly out of place.

So obvious indeed is this point of view that at first thought I was going to postpone this publication. On the one hand it seems as though the dreams of a spiritual renaissance which promised so fairly but a little time ago had perished in a sudden explosion of brute force. On the other hands the thoughts of the English race are now turned and rightly toward the most concrete forms of action struggle and endurance practical sacrifices difficult and long continued effort rather than towards the passive attitude of self-surrender which is all that the practice of mysticism seems at first to demand.

Moreover, that the deep conviction of the dependence of all human worth upon eternal values the eminence of the divine spirit within the human soul which lies at the root of a mystical concept of life is hard indeed to reconcile with much of the human history now being poured red hot from the cauldron of war.

For all these reasons we're likely during the present crisis to witness a revolt from those superficially mystical notions which threatened to become too popular during the immediate past. Yet the title for this book was deliberately chosen, mysticism means nothing if the attitude and the discipline which it recommends be adapted to fair weather alone if the principles for which it stands break down when subjected to the pressure of events and cannot be reconciled with the sterner duties of national life.

To accept this position is to reduce mysticism to the status of a spiritual plaything. On the contrary, if the experiences on which it is based have indeed transcended have indeed the transcendent value for humanity which mystics claim for them if they reveal to us a world of higher truth and greater reality than the world of concrete happenings in which we seem to be immersed then that value is increased rather than lessened when confronted by overwhelming disharmonies and sufferings of the present time.

She says, "We learn from the records of the mystical consciousness that the mystical consciousness has the power of lifting those who possess it to a plane of reality which no struggle no cruelty can disturb of conferring a certitude in which no catastrophe can wreck. Yet it does not wrap its initiative in a selfish and otherworldly calm isolate them from the pain and effort of common life rather it gives them renewed vitality administering to the human spirit not as some suppose a soothing draught but the most powerful of stimulants."

Obviously she understood the practice that we call descending the mountain a practice that we call manifesting the valley spirit. Then she deals with the question which seems to have come up again and again and always comes up, what is mysticism exactly what is it that we're speaking of?

And she says, "Of this, those who are interested in that special attitude toward the universe which is now loosely called mystical find themselves beset by a multitude of persons who are constantly asking some with real fervor some with curiosity and some with disdain what is mysticism. When referred to the writings of the mystics themselves and to other works in which this question appears to be answered, these people replied that such books are wholly incomprehensible to them.

Then she says, "On the other hand, a genuine inquirer will find before long a long number of self-appointed apostles who are eager to answer this question in many strange and inconsistent ways calculated to increase rather than to resolve the obscurity of their mind. What we call Buji Zen you will learn that mysticism is a philosophy an illusion a kind of religion a disease that it means having visions performing conjuring tricks leading an idol dreamy and selfish life neglecting one's business wallowing in vague spiritual emotions and being in tune with the infinite.

You will discover that it emancipates him from all dogmas sometimes from all morality. Then at the same time that it's a very that it is very superstitious. One expert tells him that it's simply catholic piety another that Walt Whitman was a typical mystic the third assures him that all mysticism comes from the east and it supports a statement by an appeal to the mango stick at the end of a prolonged course of lectures sermons tea parties and talks with earnest persons.

The inquirer is still heard saying too often in tones of exasperation, what is mysticism? Then she says, "Here's a definition. A little further down, mysticism is the art of union with reality. The mystic is a person who has attained that union in a greater or less degree or who aims at and believes in such an attainment.

And then she says, "When you first look at this, immediately the thing that comes up is well what is reality since it's union with reality we have to know what reality is in order to unify with it. And she says, "Let's put this aside for a moment and deal with union." And the basic thrust of her book is that sense of union.

But of course, that union with reality is none other than what we talk about in terms of intimacy being intimate being intimate with form hearing form with the whole body and mind seeing sound hearing sounds seeing forms with the whole body and mind hearing sounds with the whole body and mind.

One understands them intimately and you hear the cry be the pain with the whole body and mind that too is intimacy. We hear to forget the self. Forgetting the self is the key to it all. Forgetting the self is the key to union.

She begins to speak and this is kind of interesting at one point in the book she says, "We begin therefore to see that the task of union with reality will involve certain stages of preparation as well as stages of attainment. And at these stages of preparation for some disinterested souls easy and rapid and for others long and full of pain may be grouped under two heads.

First, the disciplining and simplifying of the attention which is the essence of recollection basically she's talking about awareness concentration. Next, the disciplining and simplifying of the affections and will the orientation of the heart which is sometimes called by the formidable name of purgation.

So the practical mysticism of the plain person will be best grasped by him in a five-fold scheme of training and growth in which the first two stages prepare the self for union with reality and the last three united successively with the world of becoming the world of being and finally with the ultimate fact which the philosopher calls the absolute and the religious mystic calls God.

Some religious mystics call it God some religious mystics call it neither being nor non-being neither absolute nor relative. Dogen speaks of it in his Genjo Kahn when he says, "All buddhas when all when all dharmas are buddha dharma there are buddhas and creatures two things enlightenment and delusion two things practice and life and death.

Then in the next line he says, "When the ten thousand things return to the self there are no buddhas and no creatures no enlightenment and no delusion and no life and no death. And then in the third line he says, "However, the buddha way is beyond being and non-being therefore there are buddhas and creatures enlightenment and delusion life and death.

And the training and the way is a long and arduous journey. And that's why at the outset we say that the essentials are great doubt great faith and great determination. There are many ways to speak of it we can talk about ten stages five stages twenty stages it's all arbitrary it doesn't matter.

There are certain things that need to be accomplished most important of all is that union with reality true realization for oneself not the words and ideas that describe it but the actual falling away of body and mind that allows union intimacy to occur.

And in that intimacy there's no knowing it there's no way to evaluate it there's no way to speak of it to analyze it to judge it categorize it or systematize it. It exists thus and it's only when we move out of that that we realize what has transpired.

But that's on one side of the balance that's the great mystic peak and that's the pity that Choke was speaking of in the poem. To this column Setsho says, "This is the great mystic peak now weeds grow rampant. Weeds growing rampant weeds are the weeds of delusion.

Just by opening his stinking mouth and pointing he's defiled it it's no longer it. The minute you say I've got it it's gone you've missed it because it's nothing to do with ideas with words with descriptions it's the truth itself the reality itself.

The second line says, "You see it clearly but to whom could you impart it? Can't be imparted can't be given and can't be received. In fact, dead men can teach they make a living in a ghost cave no communication whatsoever is possible.

And then the next line if you or Choke didn't discriminate many would never know and their skulls would litter the field. He's expressing his gratitude to Choke for his discrimination for his wallowing in the mud and playing with mud balls out of his compassion for all beings.

The valley spirit is important that's what Evelyn Underhill was speaking of in this book on practical mysticism. What she uses is some exercises for people to get some sense of what mystical vision is about. She's not outlining a course of study for a mystic she makes no pretensions in doing that.

This is for an everyday practical person to experience for for for themselves that way of seeing the world. Another way of doing it is the way of the mystical experience itself intimacy once having realized that which we call wisdom compassion necessarily follows they're mutually arising they're codependent wisdom and compassion they coexist.

You can't have one without the other any more than you can have enlightenment without delusion or heaven without a hell. And so that valley spirit is coming down off the mountain manifesting in activity it's the precepts it's activity itself it's differentiation it's the world that we call samsara.

And that world that we call samsara is none other samsara is exactly nirvana. Finally she concludes her little book with the following statement. She said, "We said at the beginning of this discussion that mysticism was the art of union with reality that it is that it was above all else a science of love.

Hence the condition to which it looks forward and towards which the soul of the contemplative has been stretching out is a condition of being as the bodily senses have been produced under the pressure of man's physical environment and their true aim is not the enhancement of his pleasure or his knowledge but a perfecting of his adjustment to those aspects of the natural world which concern him.

So the use and meaning of the spiritual senses are strictly practical too. These when developed by a suitable training reveal to man a certain measure of reality not in order that he may gaze upon it but in order that he may react to it learn to live in with and for it growing and stretching into more perfect harmony with the eternal order.

Until at last like the blessed ones of Dante's vision the clearness of his flame responds to the unspeakable radiance of the enkindling light. Do you understand if you don't understand then look at September see October green mountains transformed into red and gold yellow leaves filling the valley streams outside of this not a single thing.

So I said yes and yes I I I I I I
