This appears to be a transcript of a dharma talk given by a Zen master, likely Joshu Sasaki Roshi. The talk is a mix of teachings on the nature of reality, the importance of self-inquiry, and the process of spiritual growth.

Here are some key points that can be distilled from the talk:

1. **The world of samsara**: The speaker describes samsara as a state of pain, confusion, and doubt that is present in every aspect of our lives. It's not just external circumstances, but also our own mental patterns and conditioning.
2. **Returning to the marketplace**: The speaker quotes a poem by Ina, which says "everyone I look upon is enlightened, bare-chested, covered with the dirt of the world, wine jug in hand." This suggests that enlightenment is not about escaping the world, but rather about seeing it as it truly is.
3. **The ox herding pictures**: The speaker mentions the ox herding pictures, which are a traditional Zen teaching tool. These pictures illustrate the process of spiritual growth and self-discovery.
4. **Conditioning and karma**: The speaker emphasizes that our conditioning from parents, teachers, country, education, friends, and peers obscures our true nature. This conditioning is what creates our karma, leading to endless suffering and death (the "great death" of the ego).
5. **The importance of self-inquiry**: The speaker encourages listeners to break through their conditioning and see reality as it truly is. This requires a willingness to confront and let go of our own patterns and limitations.
6. **The simplicity of spiritual growth**: The speaker suggests that spiritual growth is not about spending years in a monastery or practicing complex rituals, but rather about making a simple choice to awaken to one's true nature.

Overall, the talk emphasizes the importance of self-inquiry, the recognition of samsara as a state of suffering, and the simplicity of spiritual growth.
