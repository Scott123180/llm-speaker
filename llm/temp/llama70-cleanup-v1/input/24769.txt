Koans of the Way of Reality, Case 108, The Great Pearls, Dana, Prologue.
Giving generously means non-greed, not withholding.
One phrase, one verse, the ten thousand things, the hundred grasses.
One dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors.
Since the beginningless beginning, there has never been a single thing to withhold.
When the Way is relinquished to the Way, the Way is realized.
When the Way is realized, the Way is manifested through itself.
When the Self gives the Self simply for the sake of giving,
the whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.
The cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth.
How can this truth be realized?
Listen to this old teaching, the main case.
A monk asked the Great Pearl,
By what means can the gateway of our school be entered?
By means of Dhanaparamita, the Great Pearl said.
The monk said, according to the Buddha,
The Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas.
Why then have you mentioned only one?
The Great Pearl said,
Deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita,
and that by its practice all the others are fulfilled.
The monk said, why is it called Dhanaparamita?
The teacher said, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.
It means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,
being and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,
concentration and distraction, pure and impure.
By giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.
The capping verse.
You may understand it, but in vain.
You may believe it, but it's to no avail.
You may describe it, but it still remains a description.
Ultimately, how is it?
The river doesn't understand, yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean.
The mountain has no words, yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things.
It is here that the sweet innocence of Dana is revealed.
As most of you, as I look around the room,
I realize that most of you have been here for the weekend,
so you were part of the whole Dana thing yesterday.
But there are also some that weren't here,
so some of what I did as opening remarks to the Dana Paramita,
or the Perfection of Giving weekend,
and I'd like to repeat so that it's clear to everyone.
Dana, we translate, for those of you that are new to the term, as giving.
Although giving doesn't quite reach it.
It's more than just something going from A to B.
It's the same as in the transmission of the Dharma.
We call it Dana Paramita, and Paramita means the practice of perfection,
or crossing over to the other shore.
And these Paramitas are part of Mahayana Buddhism.
And in Zen, we understand the crossing over to the other shore
as either the other shore and this shore are the same,
or rather the other shore arrives.
So, Dana Paramita is understood loosely as the Perfection of Giving.
And as all of you must have realized yesterday
in the process of doing that weekend,
that the teachers of this weekend
were really the people that arrived on the buses.
It would be, you'd have to be totally blind
and without any sensibility at all
not to have received an incredible amount of teaching
from our guests the weekend.
And that's at the heart of what Dana is about,
there can be no Dana unless there is both
giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.
That's the heart of Dana.
It goes both ways.
It must go both ways.
There can be no Dana unless the giver and the receiver are unified
or become one reality in the process.
So, therefore, Dana is not charity.
It's not generosity.
It's not almsgiving or donations.
or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction
or contribution, gift, philanthropy, offering.
Dana is the practice of total relinquishment.
And that's what the great pearl was talking about.
Total relinquishment, letting go,
not holding on to anything.
All the dualities must dissolve.
And needless to say,
when all the dualities dissolve,
each of those paramitas,
each of the six paramitas are there.
Dana, or giving, or the perfection of giving,
is found throughout the Mahayana literature.
It appears in the precepts.
For example,
be generous, do not be withholding.
That's Dana.
It appears in the eight awarenesses of an enlightened person,
the 52 aspects of a bodhisattva.
It appears in the paramitas.
It appears as part of the morality,
the three basic teachings of the Buddha,
one of which was morality.
So, it's obviously considered by Buddhists
to be one of the most important virtues.
It is the characteristic of a bodhisattva.
It's the life of a bodhisattva.
And in the prologue, it says,
giving generously means non-greed.
And if you really look at greed,
you realize that greed is exactly the opposite.
Greed is about holding on.
And dhana is about letting go,
not withholding, not holding back.
And then the prologue says,
one phrase, one verse,
ten thousand things,
the hundred grasses,
one dharma, one realization,
all Buddhas, all ancestors,
since the beginning.
There has never been
a single thing to withhold.
So, that's the ultimate truth
that underlies the whole thing.
We may proceed through the world
with an illusion of separateness,
with the illusion that the self
and other are separate things.
But the fact is,
there is no separation to begin with.
That's why we call dharma,
the ten thousand things,
purity itself.
There's nothing extraneous.
There's no outside.
It's all unified,
whether we've realized it or not.
If we haven't realized it,
and we proceed on the assumption
that there's a self and other separation,
then we run into all kinds of difficulties.
And that's what the pain and suffering
of this life is about.
That's what we call samsara.
So, if you haven't realized it,
although it's true,
you're not going in accord
with that realization.
When you realize it,
or when you practice
in accord with the truth
of that unity,
then it's a whole different way
of living your life.
there has never been a single thing
to withhold.
Because each one of us,
this very body and mind,
your very body and mind,
is the body and mind
of the universe.
Where would you hold it?
And who would you give it to?
And then the prologue says,
when the way is relinquished
to the way,
when you give the way
to the way,
the Tao,
to the Tao,
the way is realized.
When the way is realized,
the way is manifested
through itself.
So, the way begins
to manifest itself
through itself
when you've realized the way.
What does it mean
to have realized the way?
It means to have unified
with the way.
When you are the way itself,
the way manifests
through itself,
which is none other
than manifesting
through you.
That's what the next line means.
When the self gives the self
simply for the sake of giving,
the whole universe
gives of itself
for the sake of giving.
Again, that's about unification,
no separation.
There's no reason for it.
There's no merit
attached to it.
It's simply the way
the universe is.
And so,
the giving
is simply for the sake
of giving,
for no other reason.
Like,
you can wash the dishes
in order to have
clean dishes.
That makes it functional.
There's a purpose.
There's a process
and there's a result.
Or,
you can wash the dishes
to wash the dishes.
Just for the simple sake
of washing the dishes.
So,
the cause and effect
of this purposeless
giving
prevails
throughout the heaven
encompasses the earth.
That is,
it is
the nature
of things.
Whether we've realized
it for ourselves
or not,
it's the nature
of things.
So,
this monk,
in the main case,
comes up to
the great pearl.
And the great pearl
is the successor
of
Matsu,
the great
master Basa
who had
84
enlightened
disciples
that he
transmitted to.
Hui Hai
is one of those
disciples.
His name
in
in
Japanese
is
Daishu.
Daishu means
great pearl.
Ikai.
He got
the name
great pearl
because he
first began
studying with,
he was first
ordained
by another teacher
and then
went to study
with Matsu
and studied
with him
for a while
and then
his first teacher
became very ill
and so he
left Matsu
and went back
to take care
of his old teacher
and while he
was back
there he
wrote
a discourse
and
I'm trying
to remember
what that
discourse
was.
I guess
it was a
discourse
on sudden
elimination
and
a monk
who was
there
took that
treatise
to
Matsu
and when
Matsu
read it
he said
there is
a great
pearl
on that
mountain
and
although
he had
the name
Ikai
it was
the name
Daishu
or great
pearl
that kind
of stuck
with him
so this
monk
asked
the great
pearl
by what
means
can the
gateway
of our
school
be entered
and
he answered
by means
of
Dhanaparamita
and this
koan
is not
a koan
in the
usual sense
of the word
it tends
to be
very
explanatory
and I
think the
reason is
is that
it arose
from
a
mundo
rather
than
a
dharma
combat
shosan
dharma
combats
tend to
be
more
direct
pointing
more
head
squeezing
mondos
tend to
be
intellectual
and
explanatory
and this
is kind
of
intellectual
and
explanatory
but it
has some
value
because of
his particular
way of
expressing it
that I
thought was
important for
us to
use and
to treat
it as a
koan
so he
says by
means of
Dhanaparamita
so the
monk said
according to
the Buddha
the bodhisattva
path comprises
six paramitas
why then
have you
mentioned
only one
and the
great pearl
said deluded
people fail
to understand
that the
other five
all proceed
from
Dhanaparamita
and it's
by the
practice
by its
practice
the practice
of giving
that all
the others
are fulfilled
and in a
sense you
can say
that for
any of
the paramitas
you can say
that from
any of
the
precepts
you can say
that for
the eight
gates
of Zen
that in
each one
of them
the other
are contained
and if you
realize any
one of them
fully
you've realized
that in fact
you can say
that of any
koan
that if you
exhaust the
koan
completely
thoroughly
all of the
ramifications
and permutations
and combination
of a single
koan
you've realized
all of the
koans
and then
the monk
says why
is it
called
dana
paramita
and he
answers
dana
means
relinquishment
relinquishment
of what
relinquishment
of the
dualism
of opposites
it means
total
relinquishment
of ideas
as to the
dual nature
of good
and bad
the being
and non-being
love and
aversion
void and
non-void
concentration
and distraction
pure and
impure
by giving
all of them
up we attain
to a state
in which all
opposites are
seeing as
empty
now we've
talked about
this a
hundred thousand
times in
the fifteen
years we've
been here
these
so called
opposites
that every
one of
them
are two
parts of
the same
reality
that because
they are
mutually
arising
because
they're
codependent
that is one
cannot exist
without the
other
we can choose
to see them
as opposite
but we can
also see them
as codependent
mutually
arising
you can't
have one
without the
other
you can't
have good
without bad
you can't
have being
without non-being
you can't
have love
without aversion
or form
without emptiness
they're mutually
arising
it doesn't make
sense
one of them
heads and
tails are two
parts of the
same coin
you can't
have a coin
that's heads
heads
so it's
because of
the difference
that they
can arise
so we can
understand them
as two
separate things
a la the
differences
or because
of their
codependency
the same
thing
that's what
the gashow
is
when we
gashow
and bring
together the
palms
and bow
to each
other
we're
acknowledging
the unity
of these
two things
becoming one
thing
that's what
the bow
also is
we bow
to the
sugar
and we
bow
to the
shower
and we
bow
to each
other
and before
entering
a room
and all
of that
precedes
that action
all of that
acknowledges
that the
action is
in reality
one
thing
not two
now that
being the
case
and I've
talked about
this before
our tendency
is we get
caught up
in that
duality
and we
want to
move away
from the
thing that's
not good
to the
thing that's
good
we want to
get rid of
evil
altogether
and just
have good
we want to
get rid of
sickness
and just
have health
we want to
get rid of
old age
and just
have young
age
we want to
get rid of
bad
and have
good
we want
to move
away from
one
and go
toward the
other
and we've
built
a society
and a
technology
a
multi
trillion
dollar
business
of
selling
to the
people
getting rid
of one
and going
to the
other
take this
and you'll
be healthy
take this
and you'll
stay young
forever
take this
and everybody
will love
you
nobody will
hate you
but of course
there's no way
that you can
do that
there's no way
that you can
get rid of
one
and have
only the
other
they're two
parts of the
same reality
so ultimately
what the whole
thing comes
down to
as I've
mentioned
before
is not so
much a matter
of annihilating
one side
and having
the other
side
but rather
a process
of navigation
or what we
call the
middle way
it's the
same way
that you
take a
canoe
down a
river
the river
is filled
with all
kinds of
obstructions
rocks
bad
freeway
good
so I want
the freeway
and I want
to hit
the rocks
and so
you learn
to navigate
the river
but rivers
have a
characteristic
of changing
constantly
I mean
look at
the map
of any
river
that's two
years old
and then
check out
that river
and you'll
find out
it's a very
different river
every spring
it becomes
a new river
it's bends
and twists
and turns
and so on
happen in
accord with
the amount
of rain
and the
terrain
and so on
so it's
hard to make
a map
for it
just like
it's hard
to make
a map
for how
to live
your life
so in
order to
navigate
a river
you need
to learn
to read
the river
you need
to know
how to
manage
the equipment
the canoe
more importantly
you need
to be
one with
that canoe
you need
to respond
to the river
like a canoe
responds to
the river
and you need
to be very
alert
aware
very conscious
very centered
with single
pointedness
of mind
you get
distracted
just for a
minute
you know
you examine
your fingernails
and you've
hit something
turned over
all your
equipment
is now
being carried
down the
river
so you
need to
be there
but without
tension
if you do
it with a
lot of
tension
it's okay
if you're
doing
you know
a mile
of
white water
but if you're
doing ten
miles of
white water
you get so
exhausted by
the time
you've gotten
halfway through
it
that you
begin to
lose
all of
that awareness
and focus
and so on
so you need
to be able
to do it
without exhausting
yourself
and all
of that
is a
perfect
metaphor
for life
how to
live one's
life
how to
discern
the middle
way
how to
be able
to navigate
and respond
to circumstances
as they come
up
there's no
warning ahead
of time
you know
there's no
map in the
world that's
going to
show you
that overnight
a tree
has just
fallen across
the river
and you're
coming down
at a
goodly clip
the river
is carrying
you full
speed
and you
come around
this bend
and there
you are
there's no
passage
there's a
tree
that's
completely
covering
and its
branches
are hanging
down like
this
and
you have
to respond
what do
you do
it's kind
of interesting
and it
happens
all the
time
so
it's the
same with
our life
there's no
way to
predict
what's
around the
next bend
there's no
way to
predict
what the
next barrier
will be
that we
encounter
so all
we can
do is
develop
the skills
for working
with the
barriers
that come
up
that's
what
practice
is
that's
all it
is
those
skills
are based
on an
underlying
realization
of the
nature
of things
of the
nature
of the
self
so all
the things
we talk
about
are
explanations
of what
the underlying
truth is
that can be
realized
and when you
realize that
the explanations
are useless
the precepts
are useless
all the
paramitas
are useless
because they
become a
manifestation
of your
own life
you don't
need
that kind
of explanation
anymore
you spontaneously
respond in
accord
with things
relinquishment
of the
dualism
of opposites
I added
some footnotes
to this
starting off
with a question
that the monk
asked
by what
means
can the
gateway
of our
school
be entered
the footnote
says what
gate
where is he
what's he
saying
where is
there a
gate
a gate
means that
there's some
place that's
inside the
gate and
outside the
gate
it's like
when
nonsense
said the
Tao
is not an
outside thing
and Joshua
comes up
and says
well what's
what is
the it's
not an
outside thing
so what's
the Tao
what is the
Tao of
outside
things
if the
Tao is
not an
outside
thing
then
there must
be another
Tao
of course
Nansen
knew that
and
as well
as Joshua
knew that
there's no
inside and
outside
there's no
point of
entry
it reaches
everywhere
so right
off
you can see
where this
monk is
coming from
and the
great
pearl
was being
very
he may
have known
something about
this monk
maybe the
monk was at
a point in
his practice
where he
needed
explanations
but somebody
comes
come looking
for a
gate
I would
approach
very
differently
the next
question
the next
statement
he says
by means
of Dhanaparamita
the footnote
says
unavoidably
this will
lead to
more doubt
more questions
and still
he must
respond
then the
monk says
according to
the Buddha
the Bodhisattva
path has
six paramitas
why do you
mention only
one
footnote
says
this one
alone
what's he
talking about
what's he
talking about
one
and then
the great
pearl says
deluded people
fail to
understand that
the other
five all
proceed from
Dana and
that by its
practice all
the others are
fulfilled
footnote says
what's the old
man doing
don't create
complications
the more
he feeds
this guy
words
the more
the guy
produces
words
why is it
called
Dana
footnote
says
be generous
give him
the stick
drive him
out
Dana means
relinquishment
the master
answers
where is this
going
the footnote
says
let's see
some
relinquishment
the next
line
relinquishment
of what
footnote
says
everything
shut up
and sit
but the
master
being very
compassionate
and grandmotherly
says
relinquishment
of the
dualism
of opposites
footnote
says
too bad
he's up
to his
nostrils
in mud
and the
monk
says
what does
that mean
and
the old
man
says
it means
total
relinquishment
of ideas
as to the
dual nature
of good
and bad
being
and non-being
love
and aversion
void
and non-void
concentration
and distraction
pure
and impure
by giving
up all
of them
we attain
to a
state
in which
all opposites
are seen
as empty
footnote
says
I think
he's
drowned
this monk
with his
words
but say
did the
monk
get it
do you
get it
basically
what he's
talking
about
when he
says
relinquishment
of all
things
is letting
go
and letting
go
you know
comes up
again and
again
we talk
about it
endlessly
it's
definitely
part of
the whole
new age
vernacular
and
everybody
says it
but what
does it
really mean
usually
what it
means
when people
hear the
word
non-attachment
they simply
conclude it
means not
caring
of course
nothing could
be further
from the
truth
they think
it means
not loving
not caring
all the way
back into
the 50s
that was
the way
the
beat
zen
expressed
itself
I don't
know
I don't
care
and it
doesn't
matter
anyway
that's
that was
the
you know
the three
truths
of beat
zen
you know
that only
only people
that don't
do zazen
can make
statements
like that
with red
books
of course
we care
and of
course
it matters
not
attachment
doesn't
mean not
caring
and not
loving
it means
caring very
much
and loving
very much
you can't
really love
unless
there is
non-attachment
so long as
there's
attachment
what you
have is
two things
by the
very nature
of attachment
you have
to have
the
attachee
and the
attachor
that's
two
when these
two merge
there can
no longer
be attachment
there's nothing
to attach
to and no
one to do
the attaching
that's what
love is
no separation
that's what
caring is
no separation
that's what
dhana is
no separation
that's what
realization is
no separation
whether we're
talking about
people
or sound
or form
that's what
Dogen meant
when he said
seeing form
with the whole
body and mind
one understands
it intimately
hearing sound
with the whole
body and mind
one understands
it intimately
that intimacy
is realization
it's unity
it's one
thing
so we call
it letting
go
non-attachment
forget the
self
empty the
mind
no mind
non-dual
dharma
merging of
differences
wonderful
but how do
you get
there
well
you know
you can
recite it
in your head
a hundred
thousand times
and try
desperately
to do it
and you
know
you can
you can
do it
you know
empathy
is a
kind of a
practice
in that
direction
but keep
in mind
empathy
with someone
is still
separation
it's not
yet
unity
that's the
difference
between
doing good
and compassion
and doing
good
there's still
separation
and compassion
there's no
sense of
doer
or the
person
that's being
done
self
and other
or act
of doing
it just
happens
spontaneously
the way
the spring
breeze
warms the
earth
it doesn't
know
what it's
doing
the earth
doesn't know
about the
spring breeze
so how
do we
do it
well
no matter
how you
cut it
in this
practice
no matter
where you
look to
it
no matter
what the
teachings
are
if we're
talking
about
liturgy
or the
precepts
or art
practice
body
practice
koans
whatever
it is
it all
comes
down
to
the
old
furnace
of
zazen
the
process
of
falling
away
of
body
and
mind
and we
begin
that
process
by working
with the
body
and then
with the
breath
and then
the mind
and as
the process
gets deeper
and the
body
falls away
off sensation
of the
body
mind
is still
functioning
you know
you're there
you're
watching
the
breath
you're
feeling
the
breath
and then
you disappear
into the
breath
the breath
is just
breathing
itself
there's no
longer
an observer
watching
mind
falls
away
that's
what
Dogen
meant
in that
little
those few
little lines
that encompasses
the totality
of our
practice
to study
the Buddha
way
is to
study
the
self
you start
with all
the stuff
all the
stuff
that we
call
our
self
the bag
of skin
everything
inside it
is me
and everything
outside it
is the rest
of the
universe
that's
the illusion
and we
start
with that
illusion
and study
it
and layer
by layer
we begin
digging
at it
the layers
of conditioning
conditioning
of parents
teachers
culture
education
peers
conditioning
that began
at birth
and has
continued
through our
life
and is
constantly
reinforced
day after
day
by our
media
and our
literature
and our
politics
and sociology
and science
and religion
constantly
reinforces
the illusion
of separateness
of two
things
and we
work with
that
layer by
layer
examining
it
and letting
it go
till we
get to
that ground
of being
we learn
the practice
of letting
go
moment to
moment
in Zazen
that's why
it's so
critical
seems simple
you know
thought comes up
let it go
come back
to the
practice
well
what you're
learning
is how
to let
go
and there's
nothing
as sweet
or as
juicy
as our
own
thoughts
we love
them
we hang
on to
them
all the
beautiful
fantasies
all the
beautiful
ideas
all the
brilliant
words
it's hard
to let
go
of them
non
attachment
doesn't
mean
abandoning
them
it means
not
attaching
not
holding
on
and layer
by layer
we let
go
we get
to that
ground
of being
so to
study
the self
is to
forget
the self
once you
get rid
of all
of the
aggregates
what is
it that
remains
when the
self is
forgotten
what is
it that
remains
Dogen
says it
in the
next line
to forget
the self
is to
realize
the 10,000
dharmas
when you
forget
the self
what remains
when there's
no longer
a self
is
the 10,000
dharmas
is
everything
the whole
universe
but there's
no longer
a barrier
between you
and it
you are
it
the skin
bag
either has
embraced
the totality
of it
or has
just
disappeared
however
you look
at it
doesn't
matter
there's
merging
merging
is even
extra
there's
the
realization
that there
never
was
a
separation
and in
each
aspect
of those
10,000
8 stages
of
8 gates
of
practice
that same
thing is
functioning
non-dual
so in the
face-to-face
teaching
no separation
is at the
heart of it
in our
academic
study
not
attaching
to the
words
our
tendency
in
academic
study
is to
want to
hold
on to
the
words
we need
to
read it
hear it
throw it
away
and keep
going
even in
practice
we need
to
realize
it
throw it
away
and keep
going
whatever it
is
and ultimately
we come to
the peak
of the
mountain
enlightenment
realize it
throw it
away
and keep
going
if you
hold on
to
anything
you've
created
that
dualism
again
so that's
why we
emphasize
not only
material
things
even
spiritual
things
if you
hold
on to
it
you
create
an illusion
of
separateness
and it's
diluted
liturgy
is also
the process
of giving
we
constantly
give
in liturgy
our
gratitude
our
appreciation
for the
teachings
we receive
the teachings
we give
the gratitude
the
precepts
are another
example
of
that
non-dual
dharma
no-self
they're based
on no-self
they're based
on no-self
and designed
to function
in the world
of differences
that's what
I mean
you can't
you can't
deny
existence
the Buddha
way is
beyond
being
and non-being
it doesn't
fall into
either side
of it
in art
practice
the same
thing
the brush
paints
itself
body
practice
the dance
dances
itself
and all
of these
self
is forgotten
but one
of the
things
that's
going to
be
happening
soon
we're
coming to
our
15th
anniversary
and we've
also
just received
notification
recently
that
the
monastery
building
and its
grounds
has been
recognized
by New York
State
as a
historical
site
and it's
also been
recognized
nationally
as a
national
historic
site
and this
will give
us an
opportunity
to
do
fundraising
to restore
this
building
to do
a major
restoration
project
as well
as other
things that
we need
and so
we'll be
launching a
capital campaign
a major
fund drive
and I just
want to say
to the people
who are going
to be doing
this fund
drive
that
if it's
going to be
charity
it's not
going to
work
if it's
going to
be
generosity
it's not
going to
work
or
beneficence
or donation
or contribution
or gift
or philanthropy
it's not
going to
work
the people
that will
give
must also
receive
otherwise
it's not
dana
very important
so the
question is
to really
make clear
both
sides
of that
form
is
emptiness
emptiness
is form
form
is exactly
emptiness
emptiness
exactly
form
that's
the same
with all
dualities
the capping
verse
you may
understand
it
but it's
all in
vain
you may
believe it
but it's
to no
avail
you may
describe it
but it
still remains
a description
ultimately
how is it
the river
doesn't
understand
and yet
it knows
how to
give itself
to the
great ocean
the mountain
has no
words
yet it
gives birth
to the
ten thousand
things
it is
here
that the
sweet
innocence
of
dana
is
realized
you see
that in
children
that sweet
innocence
of giving
that's
the way
it should
be
