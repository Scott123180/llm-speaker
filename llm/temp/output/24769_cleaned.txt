This text appears to be a transcript of a lecture or talk given by a Zen master, likely Shunryu Suzuki Roshi. The topic of the talk is non-duality and the practice of zazen (Zen meditation) as a means of realizing this non-dual state.

The talk begins with an explanation of the concept of "no-self" and how it is not just a philosophical idea, but a practical reality that can be experienced through the practice of zazen. The speaker emphasizes that the goal of Zen practice is not to achieve some kind of spiritual or mystical experience, but rather to simply be present in the moment, without attachment or distraction.

The talk then delves into the concept of "dana" (generosity) and how it is a fundamental aspect of Buddhist practice. The speaker explains that dana is not just about giving material things, but also about giving oneself, one's time, and one's energy to others. He emphasizes that true generosity can only be experienced when there is no sense of self or separation between the giver and the receiver.

The talk also touches on the concept of "non-attachment" and how it is not just about letting go of material possessions, but also about letting go of thoughts, emotions, and attachments to concepts. The speaker explains that non-attachment is not a negative state, but rather a positive one, as it allows us to be free from suffering and to experience the world in a fresh and new way.

Throughout the talk, the speaker uses various examples and metaphors to illustrate the concept of non-duality, including the idea that "form is emptiness" and "emptiness is form." He also uses the example of a river flowing into the ocean to illustrate how dana can be experienced as a natural and effortless process.

The talk concludes with an emphasis on the importance of practice in realizing non-duality. The speaker encourages listeners to engage in regular zazen practice, not just for personal benefit, but also for the benefit of others. He emphasizes that true generosity and non-attachment can only be experienced through direct experience, and that words and concepts are ultimately insufficient to convey this reality.

Overall, the talk is a rich and nuanced exploration of the concept of non-duality and its practical application in Zen practice. It offers insights into the nature of reality, the importance of dana and non-attachment, and the role of zazen in realizing these principles.
