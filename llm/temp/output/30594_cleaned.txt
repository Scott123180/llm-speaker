This is a transcript of a Zen master's lecture, likely given by Shunryu Suzuki or another prominent Zen teacher. The lecture covers various topics related to Zen Buddhism and the nature of reality.

The lecture begins with an explanation of the concept of "samsara," which refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that is driven by karma. The speaker notes that samsara is not just something external, but also internal, as it is a product of our own minds.

The lecture then delves into the story of Master Eno, who was asked about the nature of reality by two monks. Eno's response, "Your mind is moving," was seen as nonsensical by the monks, but it actually contained a profound truth. The speaker explains that Eno's statement was not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a way of pointing to the fact that our perceptions and understanding are always in motion.

The lecture also touches on the concept of "ox-herding pictures," which is a metaphor for the journey of spiritual growth and self-discovery. The speaker notes that these pictures represent different stages of development, from the initial confusion and doubt to the ultimate realization of one's true nature.

Throughout the lecture, the speaker emphasizes the importance of direct experience and intuition in understanding reality. He encourages listeners to look beyond words and concepts and to seek a deeper truth that lies beyond the confines of language and thought.

The lecture concludes with a call to action, urging listeners to "raise the Bodhi part" and to break through their conditioning and limitations. The speaker notes that this process is not just about achieving some kind of spiritual enlightenment, but also about living a more authentic and meaningful life in the present moment.

Overall, the lecture offers a rich and nuanced exploration of Zen philosophy and practice, emphasizing the importance of direct experience, intuition, and self-inquiry in understanding reality.
