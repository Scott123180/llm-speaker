Here is the cleaned transcript:

Thank you for being here this weekend and participating in this Donna Weekend, which will reach its heart tomorrow. Our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow by bus from all over the county.

I'd like to take a moment tonight to clarify what Donna really means. We translate it as "giving," but giving doesn't even come close to capturing its essence. The problem lies in the English language and translating Buddhist terms into English, where the closest words have entirely different meanings, leading to misinterpretation. That's why many of these terms are retained in their original form, such as Donna.

Donna is one of the paramitas, which are six in total. These paramitas have been around for a long time and are part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is also a part of. Donna is the first of those paramitas, and each one has its own unique meaning that gets lost in translation.

For example, we translate Prajna paramita as "wisdom," but wisdom doesn't even come close to what it means. It's not about accumulating knowledge or knowing; it's something entirely different. The same goes for Karuna, which we translate as compassion, but it's actually about non-dualism and the absence of self and other.

The word dana is often translated as giving, but that misses the point entirely. Dana is not just about giving; it's about relinquishing dualism and opposites. It's about achieving a state where all opposites are seen as empty. The real practice of dana paramita involves cutting off the myriad types of current cause, which leads to the whole dharma nature becoming void and empty.

This emptiness means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever. Once that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned because our self-nature is nonexistent and doesn't contain a single thing foreign to itself. That's what it means to be true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha.

It's said in the Diamond Sutra that those who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas or enlightened ones. So, basically, dana is about forgetting the self. When there's no self, there's no other. This is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected and codependent.

In our practice, giving and receiving are at the heart of almost everything we do. That's what our service is about; that's what our liturgy is about. We receive the teachings and return gratitude. We receive food and acknowledge it by eating together with everyone.

We eat to stop all evil, practice good, save all sentient beings, and accomplish the Buddha way. The receiving of food is taken with the intent of giving, following the principle of dana. We receive the teachings and give back; we return what we've received.

The heart of this practice in Japanese Buddhism is called takahatsu, where monks beg for food and then give something back to the person who gave them the food. It's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified. The giving and receiving is a manifestation of the interrelatedness, codependency, and mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra.

What happens to one thing happens to the totality of it – past, present, future. This diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space as well as the fourth dimension of time. It's because there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously that it's never exhausted.

That's why I believe it's essential for people in helping professions to understand what they're doing. If they're not receiving while they're giving, if they're doing something for somebody else, it's all going one way. If they haven't yet understood that there's a possibility to be received, to receive something, then there's no mutual nourishment, no mutual healing.

Healer and the healed are both healed in the process. When you understand this, you don't exhaust anything; it's endless and boundless. I've seen this with real teachers – they have boundless energy because they're plugged into the center of the universe itself.

Asatani Roshi was 88 or 89 years old when he did a Jukai ceremony despite being very sick. He couldn't even do his bows, but as soon as he started the ceremony, his voice became strong, and the power of his presence enveloped everyone. The energy came from the process of dana.

Dogen said that to study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. When we forget the self, we're no longer attached to our own ego and can see things as they truly are. This is the key to understanding dana.

Now, let's talk about this holiday season. I'd like to see us do something different with it – something that aligns with our understanding of dana. We can't just oppose the forces of the universe; we have to work with them. For example, the media has done some awful things, but if we just say we won't use CD-ROMs or videos, that's not going to solve the problem.

The media is neutral; it's the artists and people who put it together that make it what it is. We can use these things in a way that nourishes rather than poisons – like photography, which can both heal and harm depending on how we use it.

I think this holiday season is an opportunity for us to do something different – to find ways to nourish and not just give gifts that are ultimately thrown away. Let's explore ways to make this holiday more positive and in line with our understanding of dana.

Now, I'd like to share a personal story about my experience as a teacher. When I first started teaching, it was difficult for me to have an attendant take care of me because of my own past experiences. But one day, my teacher visited me, and we were at the house when he said, "I don't want you to have your Anja do that." He said how can you be so selfish not to allow your students to serve you, to give back to you what you give them.

This changed my whole notion about having an attendant. I started doing it, and it's been an important part of the process for me and my students. It helps us understand dana in a deeper way – that giving and receiving are not separate but interconnected.

Now, let's talk about nourishment. I've talked about nourishment in terms of photography, art, or music. There is art that poisons and art that nourishes. When we experience art that poisons, we feel like something has been taken away from us; when we experience art that nourishes, we feel like we've received something.

That's what I hope for this holiday season – spiritual nourishment to take away as well as some pretty good food. Those turkeys are nothing to scoff at!

Now, let's close with a final thought. As a father, I feel happy when my kids feel happy. My mother used to say that to me whenever I did something crazy in my life. She said, "If it makes you happy, son, then it makes me happy." That's the way parents are – pretty weird!

Thank you all for being here this weekend and participating in this Donna Weekend.
