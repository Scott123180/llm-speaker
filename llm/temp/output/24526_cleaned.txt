This is a transcript of a talk given by a Zen Buddhist teacher, likely Roshi Bernie Glassman. The talk appears to be from a Thanksgiving dinner with his students and community.

The talk covers several themes:

1. **Gratitude and reciprocity**: Roshi emphasizes the importance of gratitude and reciprocity in relationships. He shares a personal story about how he came to understand the value of having attendants (Anja) serve him, which allowed him to receive nourishment and support from others.
2. **Nourishment and giving back**: Roshi discusses the concept of nourishment, not just physical but also spiritual. He encourages his students to give back to others, whether it's through serving them or simply being present for them.
3. **Imbalance in relationships**: Roshi acknowledges that sometimes relationships can become imbalanced, with one person giving and the other receiving without reciprocating. He suggests that this imbalance can lead to feelings of resentment and dissatisfaction.
4. **The importance of reciprocity**: Roshi emphasizes that reciprocity is essential for healthy relationships. He encourages his students to cultivate a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the support they receive from others.

Throughout the talk, Roshi shares personal anecdotes and stories to illustrate his points, making the conversation feel more like a dialogue with friends than a formal lecture. The tone is warm, humorous, and engaging, reflecting the spirit of community and connection that is central to Zen Buddhist practice.
