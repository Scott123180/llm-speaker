This is a transcript of a talk given by a Zen Buddhist teacher, likely Roshi Bernie Glassman. The talk appears to be from a Thanksgiving dinner with his students and community members.

The talk covers several themes:

1. **Gratitude and reciprocity**: Roshi emphasizes the importance of gratitude and reciprocity in relationships. He shares a personal story about how he came to understand the value of having attendants (Anja) serve him, which allowed him to receive nourishment and support from others.
2. **Nourishment and giving back**: Roshi discusses the concept of nourishment, not just physical but also spiritual. He explains that when we give back to others, it creates a sense of balance and reciprocity in relationships.
3. **Conscious giving and receiving**: Roshi notes that conscious giving and receiving are essential for creating nourishing relationships. He uses the example of making love as an analogy, where people don't think about reciprocating but simply respond naturally.
4. **Art and nourishment**: Roshi talks about how art can be either nourishing or poisonous, depending on its impact on the viewer. He hopes that spiritual nourishment will be a byproduct of their gathering.

Throughout the talk, Roshi shares personal anecdotes and stories to illustrate his points, making the conversation feel more like a dialogue with friends than a formal lecture. The tone is warm, humorous, and engaging, reflecting the spirit of community and gratitude that pervades the Thanksgiving dinner.
