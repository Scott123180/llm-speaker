Thank you for being here this weekend and participating in Donna Weekend, the heart of which will 
take place tomorrow. Our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow by bus from all over the 
county.

I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is. We 
translate it as "giving," but that doesn't quite reach it. We have a problem with the English 
language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the closest English words 
often have totally different meanings, which can lead to misinterpretation. That's why many of them 
we retain in their original form, such as Donna.

Donna is one of the paramitas. There are six paramitas, and they've been in existence for a long 
time. They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is also a part of. And Donna is the first of 
those. Each of the paramitas is difficult to translate because you somehow miss what they're about.

For example, we translate Prajna paramita as "wisdom." Paramita literally means "other shore" or "to 
cross over." In Zen, our understanding of crossing over to the other shore is that the other shore 
arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now. But if you look up wisdom in a 
dictionary, it talks about accumulating knowledge, which has nothing to do with what Prajna means.

Similarly, we translate Karuna as "compassion." Compassion implies self and other, but in reality, 
there is no dualism – no self or other. We also translate dana as "giving," but that misses the 
point because giving is not dana unless both giving and receiving occur simultaneously, unifying the 
giver and receiver into one thing.

It's the same with compassion; there's no doer or action being done to something else. There's no 
effort or sense of it occurring – compassion simply happens, like your hair growing.
