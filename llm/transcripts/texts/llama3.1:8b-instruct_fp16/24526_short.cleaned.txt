Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which 
will take place tomorrow.

Our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county.

I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is. We 
translate it as "giving," but giving doesn't even come close to capturing its essence. This is a 
problem we have with the English language and translating Buddhist terms into English, because the 
closest English words often have entirely different meanings. As a result, they become 
misinterpreted.

That's why many of these terms are retained in their original form, such as Donna. Donna is one of 
the paramitas – there are six of them in total. These paramitas have been around for a long time and 
are part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is also a part of. Donna is the first of those paramitas.

Each of these paramitas is difficult to translate without losing their essence. For example, Prajna 
paramita – "paramita" literally means "other shore" or "to cross over." In Zen, our understanding of 
crossing over to the other shore is that it's not something we achieve; rather, the other shore 
arrives, and indeed, it's right here, right now.

We translate Prajna as wisdom, but if you look up the word in a dictionary, it talks about 
accumulating knowledge. That's not what Prajna means at all – it has nothing to do with knowledge or 
knowing. Similarly, we translate Karuna as compassion, but this misses the point because compassion 
implies self and other, whereas in reality, there is no dualism.

There is no self or other; it's a unified state of being. The same goes for dana, which we often 
translate as giving. But giving is not dana – not quite. Dana can only occur when both giving and 
receiving happen simultaneously, so that the giver and receiver become one thing. It's the same with 
compassion – there's no doer or thing being done to; it just happens naturally, like hair growing.
