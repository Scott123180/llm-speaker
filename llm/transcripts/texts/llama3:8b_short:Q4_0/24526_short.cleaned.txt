Thank you for being here this weekend and participating in Donna Weekend, the heart of which will 
take place tomorrow. Our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow from all over the county 
by bus.

I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is. We 
translate it as "giving," but that doesn't quite reach it. We have a problem with the English 
language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the closest English words 
often have totally different meanings. As a result, they become misinterpreted. That's why many of 
them we retain in their original form, such as Donna.

Donna is one of the paramitas. There are six paramitas, and these have been in existence for a long 
time. They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is also a part of. Donna is the first of those 
paramitas. Each one of the paramitas is difficult to translate because you somehow miss what they're 
about.

For example, we translate Prajna paramita as "wisdom." Paramita literally means "other shore" or "to 
cross over." Our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other 
shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now. Prajna doesn't mean 
accumulating knowledge; it has nothing to do with knowing.

Similarly, we translate Karuna as "compassion." Compassion implies self and other, which means 
there's a sense of dualism. In reality, there is no compassion without the understanding that there 
is no self or other. We also translate dana as "giving," but that misses the point. Giving isn't 
dana unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously, so that the giver and 
receiver become one thing.

It's the same with compassion. There's no doer or thing being done; there's no effort or sense of it 
occurring. Compassion happens naturally, like your hair growing.
