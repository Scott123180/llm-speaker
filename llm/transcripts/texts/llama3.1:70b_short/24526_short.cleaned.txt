Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will 
take place tomorrow. Our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over 
the county.

I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is. We 
translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all. And we have that problem with the 
English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English 
versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings.

And as a result, they become misinterpreted. That's why many of them we retain in the original form, 
such as Donna. Donna is one of the paramitas. There are six paramitas. And these paramitas have been 
in existence a long time. They're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of.

And Donna is the first of those. Each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you 
somehow miss what they're about. For example, we translate Prajna paramita. Paramita literally means 
other shore or to cross over. And our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen 
is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now.

Prajna, we translate as wisdom. But wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about 
accumulating knowledge. It's not what Prajna means. It has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it 
have anything to do with knowing. So calling it wisdom misses the point.

The same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion. Compassion has a sense of empathy about 
it, which implies self and other. In compassion, there is no dualism. There is no self or other. And 
we translate dana as giving. But that too misses the point. Because giving is not dana.

Not quite dana. There can be no dana unless there is both giving and receiving occurring 
simultaneously. So that the giver and the receiver are unified. They become one thing. It's the same 
with compassion. There's no doer or the thing that you're doing to. There's no effort or even sense 
of it occurring.

Compassion happens the way your hair grows.
