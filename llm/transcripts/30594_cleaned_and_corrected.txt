Neither the wind nor the flag. Main case. The wind was flapping a temple flag. Two monks were arguing about it.

One said the flag was moving. The other said the wind was moving. Arguing back and forth, they could come to no agreement. The six patriarchs said, "It is neither the wind nor the flag that is moving. It is your mind that is moving."

The two monks were struck with awe. Master Muman's commentary: "It is neither the wind nor the flag nor the mind that is moving. Where do you see the heart of the patriarch? If you can see clearly, you will know that the two monks obtained gold, intending to buy iron. Also, you will know that the patriarch could not repress his compassion and made an awkward scene."

That's Muman's poem: "The wind moves. The flag moves. The mind moves. All of them miss it. Though he knows how to open his mouth, he does not see; he was caught by words."

Now, we've got one more full day of Sashin in front of us. And this is the time that Sashin can be most powerful. We're weak on Joriki. A lot of the activity of our mind has fallen away. And we're in a state of consciousness that's different than the way we normally are.

A week ago, a lot of barbs sticking out of everybody. Crank, scratching at each other. And by now, those have been worn down. If I saw them, to little bumps. In another week or two, they'll be back again. Try to appreciate those of you that have been sitting all week where your head's at right now. And know that it can be like that.

All the time. The more you sit, the clearer you get. The more the distance between Sashins. It's not like between Sashins. Somehow, they connect. And you don't know whether you're doing Sashin or not doing Sashin each day. You go about your work. You're sitting with the same kind of Sashin head.

It's very easy to not appreciate your situation when you're in the midst of it. Last night, we talked about the Sixth Patriarch. When he was a 24-year-old selling firewood, heard the monk chanting the Diamond Sutra. And went to Northern China to meet the Master from the monastery that the monk had come from.

And there in the Mondo with the Master, the Master realized this deep spirituality. But because of the jealousy of the monks and because he was a layman and literate and from the South, he let him work in the rice shack. And then one day, when the Master was testing his disciples to find a successor, Eno made a presentation that by far overshadowed the one made by the senior monk.

And as a result, the bowl and robe of Bodhidharma were transmitted to Eno. He became the Sixth Patriarch. And the first time it happened with a layman. And the first and only time it happened with an illiterate and also someone so young. The only other thing that could have made it even more perfect is if he were a she.

But that would have been next to impossible, Tang Dynasty, China, in the year 700. So we have to wait for the 20th century in America to have a first matriarch and saying, "Who knows, he may be he." Never can tell.

So after passing on the bowl and the robe of Bodhidharma, Master knew that Eno's life was in danger. And so he asked him, in the middle of the night, to leave. He rode him across the river. Eno went on his way, immediately pursued by this monk, Mio, an ex-general.

And finally, when Mio caught up with him, the mondo that ensued, "Think neither good nor evil at that very moment." What is the true nature of the monk Mio? Mio was enlightened. And the sixth patriarch went on into hiding, as his master had told him, to ripen, mature, not to emerge and start teaching until he had done that.

Now this coin picks it up when Eno came back out of hiding 15 years later. Now fully matured as his end master. He began wandering around the countryside. In particular, he came to this monastery. He was still a layman and he came to Hoshoji in Koshu.

And he came to hear the venerable Inju, the master there, lecturing on the Nirvana Sutra. One day, Eno happened to hear the two monks arguing and pointing at a flag fluttering in the wind. The one said that it was the flag moving; the other said it was the wind moving.

And when a flag is moving, our eyes perceive it as actually moving. But if there's no wind, the flag doesn't move. There's some reason in the statement that the wind moves the flag and therefore, the wind that is moving and not the flag.

On the other hand, the wind is invisible and it's beyond our capacity to perceive the wind itself moving. Listening to this naive discussion which seemed to get them nowhere, Eno stepped up to them and said, "It's neither the wind nor the flag that's moving. It's your mind that's moving."

This direct solution from the subjective standpoint put an end to the endless dualistic discussion and the two monks hearing it were struck with awe and greatly impressed
