The Book of Equanimity.

Case 68, Kassan's Slashing Sword, Preface to the Assembly.

Inside the heartland, the emperor's command; outside the castle walls, the general's order. Sometimes empowered at the gate, sometimes honored in the room, tell me, who is this?

That's the main case.

A monk asked Kassan, "How is it when getting rid of the dust to see Buddha?" Kassan said, "You should directly slash with the sword. If you don't, the fisherman stays in the nest."

The monk brought it up to ask Sakiso, "How is it when getting rid of the dust to see Buddha?" Sakiso said, "He has no country; where will you meet him?"

The monk returned and quoted this to Kassan. Kassan went up in the hall and said to the assembly, "In the establishment of method and school, he does not compare to me. In profound talk, entering the principal, I am still a hundred steps behind Sakiso."

Sakiso.

The verse:

"The star-brushing sword, the army-washing weather,
Settling disorder, deferring the merit, who else is it?
One morning, the haze of dust clears over the four seas."

This koan is one of the hundred koans that are part of the collection called the Book of Serenity or the Book of Equanimity. And in these koan collections, there's usually a preface to the assembly, kind of a pointer or an introduction to the koan that the compiler of the koans is attempting to show what the point of the koan is about.

And that's followed by the main case, the basic koan itself. And these koans are all taken from actual encounters between teachers or between a teacher and a student or between students in antiquity. And they're taken up as the subject for study. For study, and when I say study, I mean study in the Zen way, that is to sit with the koan and zazen and to penetrate to the truth of what's being stated.

And then usually there's a verse, a poetic expression of the key point of the koan, of the key of what the koan is about. In this particular koan, the people involved are kind of interesting characters in and of themselves. Kassan, I've talked about before. Kassan is a successor of Tokujou, Tokujou.

Tokujou is known as the boatman. In fact, when I looked up, of course there are a lot of kasans, and when I saw this kasan and this koan, I didn't remember which one it was, so I looked up the references, and they said he succeeded the boatman. And the boatman is Tokujou.

Tokujou and Dogo and Ungan, all three succeeded the same teachers, for those of you that are familiar with these different teachers. They all succeeded Master Yakuzan. And Ungan transmitted to Tozan, and that became the beginning of the Soto School of Zen, which is our lineage here.

Dogo was succeeded by Sekiso, one of the characters in this koan. Kassan mounted the high seat and addressed the assembly, and what he said is that in the establishment of method and school, he does not compare to Sakiso, referring to his dharma cousin.

In profound talk, in entering the principal, I'm still a hundred steps behind him. That is, in teaching within phenomena, I'm much better, but in teaching in the absolute, I'm much further behind him. I disagree; I say in entering in the principal, he's ahead, but in method and school, he's behind - exactly the opposite.

Sakiso first studied with Isan. Isan one day was working in the rice shack, and Sakiso came in and said, "Gifts from donors shouldn't be thrown away." The rice was always donated to the monastery, and Sakiso said, "I'm not throwing it away."

Isan bent down and picked up a grain of rice off the floor and said, "You aren't throwing it away. Where did this come from?" And Sakiso had no reply. Then Isan said, "Don't take this one grain lightly; hundreds of thousands of grains come from this one grain." And Sakiso said, "Then where does this one grain come from?"

Isan laughed and returned to his room. And that evening he went up to the high seat and said, "People, there's an insect in the rice. Where does this one grain come from? What is the source of this one grain?" What is the source of the absolute basis of reality?

Later Sakiso went and studied with Dogo, and then finally succeeded Dogo. And you may remember last weekend I gave a talk where Tozan mounted the high seat and he said, "At the beginning of the fall and the end of the summer, your brothers may go east or west, but you must go where there's not an inch of grass for 10,000 miles."

How can you go in this case? Grass is phenomenon; not an inch of grass - absolute. Sakiso said going out the gate already it's grass; just to move, to take action, already it's phenomenon, already it's the 10,000 things.

The monk related this to Tozan, who said these are the words of the teacher of 1,500 people. He approved of them. In other words, and later Sakiso did become the teacher of 1,500 people; his congregation was huge, and they sat without lying down - erect tree stumps.

His students, the name of his Zendo was the Dead Tree Hall because of this powerful sitting. So the monk asking about getting rid of the dust to see the Buddha, and the way that was dealt with is exactly the same as the koan we dealt with last week: grass and no grass - one side phenomenon, the other side principle; one side absolute, the other side relative.

One side good, the other side evil; one side cause, the other side effect. Grass, no grass; Buddha, no Buddha; blind - has it, has not. Remember Hogan and the monks? He gestured to the window; two monks got up and rolled up the blinds identically, and he said, "One has it, and one has not."

Or Yakujo and the fox: the old man said he does not fall into causation, for that he was made to live the life of a fox. Yakujo said he does not ignore causation, and he freed the man from the fox body.

Falling into causation, not falling into causation - all these dualities. One old master said, "Is there no one with two faces on one die?" One teacher shows the absolute; the other teacher shows relative. One teacher enters a principle; the other functions in phenomena.

Master says, "Isn't there anyone that knows how to merge these two things? Is there a way to merge these two things?" If so, how? When you see that, you see the merging and the functioning of all dualities.

We're not talking about some kind of theoretical thing here - absolute and relative. We're talking about life; we're talking about all of the dualities that we encounter in life. You see it here with the absolute and relative; you'll see it with the 10,000 things - that's where it counts, that's where it's got the function.

The verse: "The star-brushing sword, the army-washing weather,
Settling disorder, deferring the merit, who else is it?
One morning, the haze of dust clears over the four seas."

Robes hanging down, the imperial rule is naturally effortless. Star-brushing sword just speaks of the far-reaching power of that sword of wisdom. The sword of wisdom not only kills; it also gives life.

Kills is the death of the ego; giving life is to be born as the 10,000 things itself - that is, to realize the 10,000 things themselves. Army-washing weather is a reference to an old legend Chinese about a general who was preparing for war.

Suddenly a great storm came, started raining for days, and the general said, "Isn't this a disaster to the king?" And the king says, "No, it's heaven washing the troops." This is a reference to the way that same point was turned around in the koan: settling disorder, deferring the merit.

Who else is it? Who indeed is it? Who is it that settles disorder? Who is it that can go beyond the merit? Kassan, Sakiso - Sakiso. The Buddha - just to even mention that, you should cover up your ears and run away.

Who else is it? Robes hanging down, the imperial rule is effortless. This is a reference to the book of changes and a kind of metaphor that's in the book of changes. It refers to the effortless rule was in force without command.

Robes hanging down is that image - in other words, everything just as it is, perfect and complete, lacking nothing. All the grunting and groaning is unnecessary. There is no creature on the face of this great earth that fails to cover the ground upon which they stand.

That's why when you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha. The diamond sword kills the Buddhas and ancestors, cuts the vines and entanglements, and breaks up all the nests. One master said, "The subtle essence fundamentally has no location throughout the body."

Where else is the source of its traces? I ask who is it that's asking. It's because of inequity that the sword is drawn from its precious scabbard. The teacher says, because of inequity - no balance.

The Buddha way is the middle way, and we've got all this extra attached to it. We fall into one side or the other: good, bad; heaven, earth; up, down; samsara, enlightenment. Cut away the extra - that's what the sword is for.

Seeing the Buddha is extra; don't see Buddha, see yourself. It's to treat disease that medicine has taken from the golden jar. Disease - the loss of ease. We need medicine to restore it to that point of balance.

But we should appreciate the fact that the extra that the sword is cutting and the sword cut each other. When you get through using that sword to cut away the extra, you still got the sword; they need to cut each other; they need to dissolve each other; they need to both disappear - extra and the sword.

The same with medicine and sickness: medicine and sickness must of necessity heal each other. Where do you find the self? That's what makes the difference in how you understand medicine and sickness. Heal each other, the sword and the extra cut each other.

Where do you find the self? If you say nowhere, then I ask you who is answering. Who is it that says nowhere? What is it that feels? What is it that thinks? What is it that lives?

Keep in mind that the truth that has been transmitted mind to mind, generation to generation for 2,500 years cannot be found in either of those extremes - neither self nor not a self. And what is the truth? Can you show me? Can you live it?

That's the great matter of the Buddhas and ancestors. Everything else is extra; everything else is part of the process for seeing and realizing that truth for oneself. See it, and you make it.
